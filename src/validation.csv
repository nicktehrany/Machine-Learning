"
Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
'Bout things today
And fallen leaves


Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes


Gonna see the river man
Gonna tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time
If he tells me all he knows
'Bout the way his river flows
And all-night shows
In summertime


Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure


For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more


Gonna see the river man
Gonna tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free
If he tells me all he knows
'Bout the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me


Oh, how they come and go
Oh, how they come and go

"Hide your background, hide your fame
Hide your given middle name
Swallow your pride, swallow your pills
In your house up in the hills

Leave your husband, leave your wife
Keep on runnin' your whole life
Sweep your dirt under the rug
Fix your hurt with a little love

From the cradle to the grave
You will always be a slave
To the quiet darkness of your memories
And that's the truth my friend
The ugly truth my friend
I've got proof my friend
And that's the truth

Keep your secrets to yourself
Keep your paperbacks up on the shelf
Burn your bridges, burn your friends
Blow them kisses and make amends

Take the high road or take the low
No one but you and God will ever know
And you play rough and win or lose
Either way, you'll get the blues

From the cradle to the grave
You will always be a slave
To the quiet darkness of your memories
And that's the truth my friend
The ugly truth my friend
I've got proof my friend
And that's the truth

I've got proof, my friend
And that's the truth

They used to tell me you got to choose a side
Now it's four years later, and they beg for advice
Don't trust the critic, he's a cynic, make the call for yourself
This is my 10-step course to not be like everyone else


And I know it's not the easiest route
And I know it leaves you overflowing with doubt
But if you want it, you can have it
Hope it's all that you dreamt
'Cause once you got it, forget it
I won't be leaving this


You can't trust everyone you meet
They won't amount to anything
Go tell them, go tell them
It's not as simple as you think
You can't trust everyone you meet
They never meant that much to me
Go tell them, go tell them
It's not as simple as you think


Clenched fists held above me
You will never bring me to my knees
I said clenched fists held above me
You will never bring me to my knees
You'll get what you deserve!

"High on the mountain what do you see
Bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
You better get your rifles boys before it's too late
The bear's got a little pig and headed through the gate
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Doin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump
He never been caught and he ain't never been treed some folks say looks a lot like me
I saved up my money and I bought me some bees
They started makin' honey way up in the trees
I chopped down the tree but my honey's all gone
Ole Slew Foot's done made himself at home
He's big around the middle...
Winter's comin' on and it's twenty below the river's froze over so where can he go
We'll chase him in the gully and we'll run him in the well
And shoot him at the bottom and we'll listen to him yell
He's big around the middle...

Ah, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account 
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount 
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
 Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws


We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""Doo, doo,"" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm, mmm!""
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff


Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach, I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real


When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in,my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck?
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothin' but a buckshot, ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf


Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?


Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham


Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too

Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist

Will I need a miss of my life
Each time I went left, I should've gone right
And love's no exception to this rule
Cause I turned around I lost you
Now I'm feeling lonesome and blue
Just the way I expect to
But there's something that I could use
To help me deal with this abuse


If French fries were fat free
And you still love me
If French fries were fat free
And you still love me
What a wonderful world this would be
If the whiskey really helped me
Forget your memory
I'd wear a smile endlessly
If French fries were fat free
And you still love me


You know the more I think about you
The more sense it makes
Cause grease and love both cause heartache
So I raise my glass and toast
These things I want the most
Though I probably never see
I can't help but believing

The evil wolves in the dark are howling again
I wish that I could sleep every now and then
The moon is shining in, in my face so bright
In this never-ending storyteller's night


It was not worth to remember
Left all alone in the cold
We never give up, no surrender
But our souls have been sold


Holy creatures coming out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Holy creatures riding the spark
Hiding in unholy light
Holy creatures coming out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Holy creatures riding the spark
Hiding in unholy light, yeah


The hunting in my darkest hour still goes on and on
Evil faces smiling bright, appearing from dusk until dawn
The earls of darkness bringing in torture, slaughter, and pain
I tried to stay awake, but that was in vain


It was not worth to remember
Left all alone in the cold
We never give up, no surrender
But our souls have been sold


Holy creatures coming out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Holy creatures riding the spark
Hiding in unholy light
Holy creatures coming out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Holy creatures riding the spark
Hiding in unholy light, yeah
Oh...




Holy creatures
Out of the dark, twisting around in the night
Riding the spark in unholy light, the creature
It was in the dark, unholy again
Holy creatures, oh holy creatures
They're out of the dark, twisting around in the night
Hiding in unholy night, holy creatures
We never give up, never surrender
But our souls have been sold, never give up in the night

In search of love and for a wife to call my own, yeah

Swear that I can't get no rest in California


Swear that life is, just a whole bunch of vices
Niggas biting off of my shit, my dick
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license
Tell her hold on like some vice grips
Might just call her, let her ride with a baller
Look up on her face was priceless
Wonder what my type is, well, tonight Mrs. Lightskin
With a light mix or a light switch, white chick
Darkskin complexion and she righteous
I take a dyke chick if she like dick
I kissed the dyke chick and I liked it
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch, light this


Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it

Bless, sit back and relax one time, clear your mind

'Bout to send me back to my old ways, know what I'm saying?

Yeah, I'm just, she making mistakes



I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs


I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce
Ride with a nigga mane, and you know
I stay fly like the jigga mane, and it figures
Cause here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes
Guess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts


Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it

Inhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP

I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

""No reason to get excited""

""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now

While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching

As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night

And all that followed fell like mercury to hell
Somehow we lost our heads for the last time
And all that followed fell like mercury to hell
Somehow we lost our heads for the last time

And I don't dream since I quit sleeping
And I haven't slept since I met you
And you can't breathe without coughing at daytime
Neither can I
So what do you say?
Your coffin, or mine?

"He looked funny
The children called him the scarecrow
An old raincoat
And baggy trousers and sneakers
He found at the dump
Oh, but if you bothered to look
There was something behind the rags
Oh there was a look in his eyes
It was something you'd never forget
He lived badly
A broken shack on the railway
An old moggy
The only one who replied
When he talked to the walls
Oh we didn't understand
We were fooled by the dirt on his face
Oh we were human then
We were searching behind his disgrace
Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you go to your homes
Why don't you keep to yourselves
I'm tellin you
Why don't you leave me alone
You're never gonna realise
When all you do is criticise
You're never gonna make it work
You never seem to get enough
You crumble when it's getting rough
You're never gonna make it work
I'm tellin' you there'll come a day
You're gonna blow yourselves away
It's wrong that I should interfere
I just get in the way
Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you go to your homes
Why don't you keep to yourselves
I'm tellin you
Why don't you leave me alone
Deep into the night
He was working by the light
Of the candle by his bed
On the theory in his head
He was building from the junk
That he rescued from the dump
And when he turned the power on
There was a sound and he was gone
Oh in the gray of the dawn
We discovered the thing he was working on
Oh we didn't understand
The future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time

My gas tank needle doesn't show how much gas I'm about to blow
Told $lick, ""don't roll down the windows!""

Swam out the whip, hold my breath, count to ten

Cause I can't stop following dreams
We’ll rise in waves and waters
In the sea, you will carry me

So come along with me
'Til we break and flee
In stormy nights, we can be free
I’ll dive into the sky

Fuck you, bitch, I'm here all by myself
I tried the belt, but couldn't get it tight enough
So I smoke the blunt, my lungs are rust
My brain is dust from all of these drugs
I can't think straight, I'll walk the plank
Spill my blood so sharks will come and eat me 
—Whole!
In between Hell and Earth, I do the limbo
My body alive, but my mind is dead
Going through the motions, all of them emotions
Dump me in the ocean, I'm drowning again
We don't have to pretend


Okay, here we go, blade to my throat
Whole floor soaked with blood from a goat
Bag full of dope, room full of smoke
All black coat with a wolf for a cloak
Do you feel my essence? Depressing presence
My main goal in death is to blow up heaven
Don't get the message, can't teach the lesson
Just a feeling that you get when you hang with peasants
Ridin' down Crescent, my weapon is oh-so-sharp and ready
Ward of the 7th, the legend is that you won't see twenty
Me and Lil Uzi full of cruelty, just a product of the times
The fucking highly almighty, the G, the 5, the 9

Touched all his life

Where is the saviour of the sidewalk life
And the road that takes us to the crusades

As they're moving in my sleep
Leading the blind poet to his grave

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?

I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away

And Hell itself is my only foe
Cause I've no fear of dying
I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me

Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare

Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side

Oh Oh


My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever

I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind




Fill all of the navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off

Beneath the snowy veil

Still breathing the fresh mountain air

She leaned over
Wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the Beast before
But she left there wanting more and more

But when she was walking
On down the road
She heard a sound that
Made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back:
""I'll take you on a ride
From here to eternity!""

Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
I've made her feel like
She's on cloud nine

She heard the engine sigh

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the Devil's bend
The Beast and Charlotte
They were two of a kind
They'd always take the line
From here to eternity

Build a chapel in your heart

Does our love grow strong or die

Do you ever wonder why

Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin' getting high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on


I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on


I know them ain't tears coming down your face
When it's on it's on but wipe your eyes
In this world only the strong survive y'know
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
Welfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, carjackings
Yeah we got problems but believe me when I tell you
Things always get better God don't like ugly
And God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
God bless the child that can hold his own
Y'know? You got to stand strong
And when these busters try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face tell em hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop, Hmmm
Hold on, and be strong, this here is Black Man


If you don't never leave nothin', learn one thing
It don't stop, til the casket drop
Hold on

Chances for redemption
And I have forgotten your name
And I thought it'd be easy
To move on completely
Forgetting what was real and what was

Forget the past, Don't for once think you're better than what I have
You're the reason I never trusted anyone
Forget the past, Don't for once think you're better than what I have
You're the reason I never trusted anyone

Just to forget wouldn't make me as happy as it would to hate
Just to forgive is so much more than you are worth

And you tore
My life apart

You could've cared less if I was dead

You were singing and drinking I wanted to let go
But the water was rising I thought it would drag us down
Just us alone on the river, our friends had all left town


And so we stumbled ahead and sample, the sign, we were home
Well the dream became a labour of love
And as we partied away we 
And we would never again be the same from within or without


And as you stare in to his eyes you can tell he's a sore, and though
He was like us someday and we should know

The sun shine's after the rain
Girl I know


Cuz I been there before
In this world all alone
And you been there for me
And you gave me your all
I've there before
You'll come around
And you'll be alright
Cuz this is your time, so






Just when you think love's about to end
That's when you find a new beginning
It's a part of life
You wonder why you go all through a change
Why it seemed like things never go your way
Girl, I know how it feels to be alone


Cuz I been there before
At the bottom alone
I know the way to reach the top
You got to let go
I've been insecure
You'll come around
And you'll be alright
Cuz this is your time, so



Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Whoa

 - Tonight
Gotta take these records off the shelf
Play something special for yourself
It's over now
Gotta leave your troubles far behind
On just enough to ease your mind



Oh, tonight
Gotta take these records off the shelf
Play something special for yourself
Oh, tonight
Troubles are far behind
Let me ease your mind

Never good just the bad and the ugly
Laid in front of you
Nothing quite like seeing the world
Through the TV's window

Feeling helpless I look for distraction
I go searching for you
Wandering through our city to find some
Solace at your door


I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
Tell me, did you see the news tonight?


Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Now draw me close...


So come on, let's forget the emotion
Tie the blinkers on
Hold both hands right over my eyes
Deafen me with music

'Till we're lost in the heat of the moment
And I'm moving in you
Help me keep these hours alive
Help me chase those seconds


I just keep talking about it
But I'll do nothing about it
Tell me, did you see the news last night?


Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold you can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be

Swallowed up the world without a trace

It's another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I ain’t too young to worry
And I ain’t too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
And another empty bed
Ain’t too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head


That's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do...


I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
 Standing on the edge of the road
 Thumb in the air
 One of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
Till then I'll just keep riding on




Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain’t too young to realize
That I ain’t too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, another red-light street
And I ain’t too old to hurry
Cause I ain’t too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat


But I'm lonely
Lord I'm lonely
What am I gonna do?


I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
 Got myself a one-way ticket
 Goin' the wrong way
 Gonna change my evil ways
... one of these days
One of these days...




I'm gonna ride on

Ride on, Lookin' for a truck

Ridin' on and on and on and on and on and on and on

And the dogs stop their howls on the porch
My head is an ocean and I'm getting homesick
For a place I've never known
And I just keep laughing when I'm stuck in traffic
At the metaphor I've become
Maybe I'm restless, a manic depressive
Or maybe I need someone, or maybe not

So please just give me something for the pain
'Cause my heart softens to your name
And when you're gone I come undone
And when you're gone how come I'm weak
And I walk wires and I pull teeth
And I'm so tired of chasing dreams
I need someone to wake me up
I need someone to wake me up

I remember the evening you showed me Cat Stevens
Now I fill the room up with ""Father and Son""
Two minutes emotion, four hours I'm frozen
By the fear and the boredom
Now I've ran out of reasons to pick up the pieces
I just tried to recall what once was
Maybe I'm desperate, or manic depressive
Or maybe I need someone, or maybe not

So please just give me something for the pain

And I want you
Fill your sleep and haunt you
To see the mess you've made
You've made

And I want to
Believe I haven't lost you
It's driving me insane
Insane

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, life goes on


As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on


How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G

Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!

Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone

Gone on, 'cause they passed away

This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby

So I'd bang out one on my piece of junk guitar

To the levee where the party never stopped

Sitting around the fire one night Tommy called my name
I turned around, he said, ""hey what do you think?""
Had his arm around the prettiest girl I'd ever seen
He kissed her hard and took another drink
I said you must be an angel putting up with this guy
She laughed and said play me some Rolling Stone
I couldn't let that chance go by
Yeah I, I sang ""You Can't Always Get What you Want""

We always just wound up talking 'bout him

Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so

I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be


Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how


This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no

Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell


Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I won't know how




Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart

Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

They would yell, they would scream, they were fighting it out
She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream
While she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, it’s a memory now
Holding onto a dream
While she watches these walls fall down


Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who’s right? Who’s wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain’s still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home


Wrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out
Made it clear she’s still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls
Feeling empty, they’re vacant now
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you’ve fought
She’s a scar, she’s the bruises, she’s the pain that you brought
There was life, there was love
Like a light and it’s fading out


Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who’s right? Who’s wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain’s still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home


You've gotta let it go
You’re losing all your hope
Nothing left to hold
Locked out in the cold
Your pain and memories
They washed out all the scenes
I'm stuck in between
A nightmare and lost dreams


Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home

That couldn't be mine not without lyin'
Was I feeling kind a silly

Well she claimed she was a killer
And she owned a floodlit villa
A little aways from the main highway
Oh, take me way down yonder, woo


She was tall, thin and tarty
And she drove a Maserati
Faster than sound
I was heaven bound
Although I must have looked a creep
In my army surplus jeep
Was I being too bold
Before the night could get old?
No, no, no, no
She proved me so wrong


Oh the Italian girls sometimes hold their religious habits
In front of your eyes, just to get you tied
Ah, but not my little Bella 'cause I did not have to tell her
That I'd be gone, with the morning sun
She made me so tired, woo
She took me way, way, away down yonder, woo
'Til I was gone with the morning sun on my back, woo


Gotta get on back there soon as I can
Take me there
And I miss the girl so bad

I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine

In someone else's arms right down the road

Something unwanted has entered our existence
I think it's better to view it from a distance
Yes, I really do

Baby, you owe me one

I should've seen this through
But I knew how it could end
Yeah, I guess things don't change
I let feelings fade again


But I see you clear as day
And I won't let go
What I called a home, unless
It slips right through my fingers in the rain
But I've thrown it all
Over waterfalls


I'm staring at the clouds
You know I hate this weather
But we can work it out
I swear I could do better if you let me
So we wait for things to change
I never thought that this could end
If I'm not with you how could I fall asleep again?


What's wrong with the lights low?
Just tell me what it is you're tryna say
'Cause in the end you'll understand
I'm already a world away, yeah


And I see you haven't changed
'Cause this shit gets old
With a heart of gold, you know
If I need you, I'll see you in my dreams
But I've thrown it all
Over waterfalls


I'm staring at the clouds
You know I hate this weather
But we can work it out
I swear I could do better if you let me
So we wait for things to change
I never thought that this could end
If I'm not with you how could I fall asleep again?


You know that I've been here times before
When no one's watching
You won't notice, no, that's right
You won't ever know my life
It's on the table
Like they always told me
I would be the same but
I'm just feeling phoney
They don't really notice
You don't really know me

When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
They much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you're so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides nobody can be that wise


I can't help you if you won't help yourself
I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else 
I can't help you if you won't help yourself


You got a degree in philosophy
So you  think you cleverer than me 
But I'm not just some drama queen
Cause its where you're at, not where you've been
So what do you expect from me 
To hold your head above the sea 
And carry you, even though you bigger
Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we still so young 
And this isn't yesterday


I can't help you if you won't help yourself
I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else 
I can't help you if you won't help yourself



You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most of the time
And I, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knew

Dog day Tuesday
Hope that girl she come today
Hard life it's a city life
Sweat keep pourin' down
I've got my feet up like to love
Through the dawn till I've blown
All I want's her lovin' down
Love the way she move around

Need no excuse
To let it all hang loose
My body's blown a fuse

Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power


You've got a love life up all night
Darkest hour at the dead of night
Seen her walkin' down the street
The kind of woman that brings on heat
Loved her dusk till dawn
Come the morning she was gone
Took me out to my surprise
Money's gone left high and dry


Need no excuse
To let it all hang loose
My body's blown a fuse


Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
You'll end up torn to shreds




Don't need no excuse

"Four thirty A.M, I'm awake again
Singing to the dark through open eyes
While dreaming I see only you and me
Stuck between desire and compromise
If I said I want you back I'd be a liar
There's nothing left of us to long for anymore
But inside the ashes burns an endless fire
And every night I can't help reaching out for more
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
You're leaving me scars scattered in my heart
A road map of all the places you have been
And I can't escape, can't wash this away
Love has burned your mark so deep within
If I said I want you back I'd be a liar
There's nothing left of us to long for anymore
But inside the ashes burns an endless fire
And every night I can't help reaching out for more
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep

You think you can walk all over me
Go ahead and tell the world I did, it won't make a difference

I'm coming to find you, we're all coming to find you
I'm coming to find you, we're all coming to find you

Our time has come, we're taking over 
We're done with being patient, no time for second chances

There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You only have one option; Come out here and face me like a man

Oh, I'm coming to find you, we're all coming to find you
I'm coming to find you, we're all coming to find you

Our time has come, we're taking over 
We're done with being patient, no time for second chances
So listen up now, we're taking over 
We're done with being patient, it's time to take a stand

You think you control me?
Well I can't be stopped, I can't be stopped
This pain is coming to an end, this pain is coming to an end

Safe from all the wind and snow

And your hair is turning grey

Lights out, I still hear the rain
These images that fill my head
Now keep my fingers from making mistakes
Tell my voice what it takes to speak up, speak up
And keep my conscience clean when I wake


Don't make this easy
I want you to mean it
Jasey 
You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out



Now there's an aching in my back;
A stabbing pain that says I lack
The common sense and confidence
To bring an end to promises
That I make in times of desperate conversation
Hoping my night could be better than theirs in the end
Just say when


Don't make this easy
I want you to mean it
Jasey 
You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out



I've never told a lie and that makes me a liar
I've never made a bet but we gamble with desire
I've never lit a match with intent to start a fire
But recently the flames are getting out of control

Call me a name, kill me with words
Forget about me, it's what I deserve
I was your chance to get out of this town
But I ditched the car and left you to-

Wait outside, I hope the air will serve to remind you
That my heart is as cold as the clouds of your breath
And my words are as timed as the beating in my chest

Buried so far away
Into my life of nothing


Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!

Burying my life so slowly

Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me

Reaming through my heart!
Screaming through my voice!
Nothing I can kill!
Screaming a lie I am!
Can't you tear my eyes out?
Can't you take my heart away to heart?

Sensation washes over me, I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago, I don't remember
Tear a hole so I can see my devastation
Feelings from so long ago, I don't remember


Holding on to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind the mask this time
And try to believe


Blind your eyes to what you see, you can't embrace it
Leave it well enough alone and don't remember
Cut your pride and watch it bleed, you can't deny it
Pain you know you can't ignore, I don't remember


Holding on to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind the mask this time
And try to believe


If I can remember
To know this will conquer me
If I can just walk alone
And try to escape into me


Sensation washes over me
I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago

I have an illness
And it is called myself
I am so desperate
I'm getting in over my head
I regret so many things I've done
The past is to remind me how broken I am
How broken I am, how broken I am


How naive I was
How naive I was


I've suffered the consequences
This world is not for me
I've suffered the consequences
I've failed you, I've failed everyone


I've put so many things above you

I don't know who I am anymore

My body begins to burn

And my hope is dying

"When the postman don't call on Valentine's Day
And Santa Claus don't come on a Christmas Day
That umbrella won't work on a rainy day
Don't ask me, I already know

When they find you beached on the barrier reef
And the only pleasure treasured is in map relief
The choice is yours, sure, saint or thief
Don't ask me, I already know

Yes, they baked your cake in little slices
Kept your eyes on rising prices
Wound up winning booby prizes
I'm sure you'd like to think you know what life is

Find destiny through magazines
Liplicking, unzipping, Harpers and Queens
From here to eternity without in-betweens
Ask me, I already know

With your heart on parade and your heart on parole
I hope you find a sucker to buy that mink stole
School for scandal, guess who's enrolled
So ask me, I already know

When they find you beached on the barrier reef
When the postman don't call on Valentine's Day
When the only pleasure treasured is in map relief
When you don't tell the truth, that's the price you pay

When I'm shaking a hand, I'm clenching a fist
If you gave me a pound for the moments I missed
And I got dancing lessons for all the lips I shoulda kissed
I'd be a millionaire, I'd be a Fred Astaire

I got me a check just short of 150 
Or north of 130  Or one-thousand Benjie's
Yeah, I threw my momma I think like twenty-five
Fuck them college loans, 'cause twenty-two isn't right
Twenty-five in Airbnb alone, that's no lie 
But, I still had to provide
Plus, I had paid all my dealer's best 
Who let me slide? 'Cause it be's like that 
ATM knows where yo card, it turned off
When I had a job, I was not seen at all
I was still drivin' on E, no gas 
Nothing but lint in my jeans, low cash
Hadn't seen a bank in like fifty-eleven years 
Havin' others work the stove, sharin' one forty ounce here
Straight outta no cash, them boom, oh my
Sunshine my forecast, brighten my sky
I tried to make it flip, like old metal jam years
Still payin' high rent, thank God I'm still rich

Every night, when things come down
The  children all asleep at last
We  stay up for a while
Sit together, have some coffee
And talk about the day we had
I  take your hand and smile


How  much I love you
And how long since I've told you
How  good just to be near you
To hold your hand and sit beside you
How good it is to live with you


Now it's time to go to bed
Turn  out the lights and listen
To the lonely sounds of night
Lying with you in the darkness
To reach out and to touch your face
Makes everything alright


How much I love you
How good to lie here with you
To feel your passion growing
Make joyful love, to be together
How good it is to live with you


How much I love you
How good to lie here with you
To feel your passion growing
Make love and sleep in peace together
How good it is to live with you

Hey, just calling you back
I'm feeling pretty good today actually, didn't throw up at all
Yeah, tomorrow I got this procedure
I think everything is gonna go smooth there, though
Um, I'm hoping anyway
I need some good news for once


Don't wanna hear it's over, what a rude awakening
The angel of death has come and ripped you from our lives
I can't stand the devastation, relentless agony
Hope that I get to see you on the other side


Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right


Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind, your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore


What faith I had is broken, and I question everything
And those shards of doubt begin to penetrate my heart
With every waking hour, within everything I see
The shadows of your loss are tearing me apart


Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right


Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind, your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore





My world is shattered, in disarray
I'm beaten down, drained emotionally
They say in time the pain goes away
But in my soul it will forever stay


Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind, your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind, your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums


Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes


Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon


Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second


Now the curtain opens
On a portait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away


Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses


Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses


When the curtain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning

Still got my guns, but I visualize One Nation

Get your ass on the cash checks, mash in packs

Puttin' it down more potent than that shit you're smokin'

Bomb like the Arabs do, the end be tragical

So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall
So try to live with the things that you've done
And try to take all the things that I've loved
You won't break me, I will rise above
This fire will burn until we fall
Run run running, I keep running, I keep running
Running, running, running, I keep running, I keep running
Run run running, I keep running, I keep running away
I keep on running away
I keep on running

The name is Q-Tip, entering through the middle
From the left, dead all the jokes and the riddles
Coming for the maximum gain, the octane
That's on the radio, it made me feel so low
Emcess have gotta write in the damn prison
I'm Nintendo 64 and you Mattel Intellivision
Bussing from them old trey-eights, now papi wait
This joint is like a Ruger, watch it roar like a cougar
Now we gotta move on the dance floor
And work it out all night, that's what you came here for
Just him, I fills it to the rim
Your shine is looking dim; daddy, shine the light on him
And him is me, leader of the Starfleet Force
Guaranteed to knock your joint off course
You took a loss? Damn right
Sure as Tina made Ike
We gon' put it in your noggin all night, and all day
The tri-lateral commission we missin'
Tell the citizens we straight, but like snakes, they hissin'
I'll be damned if I let a song go on to the side
Won't piggyback some shit, let's ride, come on


I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?
I put it down now, what you gon' do?

When you hear this, recognize you hear love
MC nigga illin' over B-boy dubs
Riding through the shit like Tron
Does it matter if you're on board, do you wanna get on?
'Cause if you do, watch all the moves that we make
Gotta do your things, ain't no time for mistakes
It's a hip-hop cat that can't fuck with Jake
Just because he wear a badge doesn't mean he's straight
So, chew on it, swallow it down and let's make it
Disregard those who fake it
Yo, it doesn't matter about the whelm, hip-hop is to the helm
It's the vine that hit the mind like slippery elms


Put it down now, put it on down
Put it down now, put it on down

Lately when I look into your eyes
Baby, I fly, you're the only one I need in my life
Baby, I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside

I can't control the butterflyz

Got me flying so high in the sky

From the start you told me, yeah, I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling

It's safe to say that no one is waiting for you
To draw your lifeline, and
One million voices are begging you to follow the lines
And you keep on thinking that
We're all falling down or wasting our time
If we're chasing our childhood dreams
Where's the glory?
If there's nothing to see!


There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight
But you gave up countless times
There's no hope in your mind
No dream of a lifetime
Only reasons to turn back


You focus now on the comfort of your fate
This fragile world that keeps you in this state
You just look back on these fading memories
Sitting alone, while hope keeps me singing
We're not falling down or wasting our time
As we're chasing our childhood dreams
Here's the glory!


There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight
But you gave up countless times
There's no hope in your mind
No dream of a lifetime
Only reasons to turn back


My words ring in your head each and every day
We're still oceans apart and miles away
Now, you'd better forget what you leave behind
This, could be your last chance to make up your mind!
I can't get over it!


It's time, for you to trust, in yourself!
Drop your doubts!


There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight
But you gave up countless times
There's no hope in your mind
No dream of a lifetime
Only reasons, to turn back!

Every time when I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay


Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win


Half my life's in books' written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you


Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Dear darling, your mom - my friend
Left a message on my machine
She was frantic saying you were talking crazy
That you wanted to do away with yourself
Guess she thought I would be the perfect resort
Because we've had this inexplicable connection since our youth
And yes, they're in shock
They are panicked
You and your chronic
Them and their drama
You this embarrassment
Us in the middle of this delusion


If we were our bodies
If we were our futures
If we were our defenses
I'd be joining you
If we were our culture
If we were our leaders
If we were our denials
I'd be joining you


I remember vividly a day years ago
We were camping
You knew more than you thought you should know
You said I don't want ever to be brainwashed
And you were mind boggling, you were intense
You were uncomfortable in your own skin
You were thirsty
But mostly you were beautiful


If we were our name tags
If we were our rejections
If we were our outcomes
I'd be joining you
If we were our indignities
If we were our successes
If we were our emotions
I'd be joining you


You and I we're like four year olds
We want to know why, and how come about everything
We want to reveal ourselves at will and speak our minds
And never talk small and be intuitive
And question mightily and find God my tortured beacon
We need to find like-minded companions


If we were their condemnations
If we were their projections
If we were our paranoias
I'd be joining you
If we were our incomes
If we were our obsessions
If we were our afflictions
I'd be joining you


We need a reflection
We need a really good memory
Feel free to call me a little more often

You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'till four

A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all and you can hear him cry
""Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?""

Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine

Make good money, five dollars a day

Far, far away and where the wind freezes your face
There you won't be alone

Far, far away, I can see what happens soon

"Cherise was brushing her long hair gently down
It was the afternoon of carnival
As she brushes it gently down
Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
It was inlaid with a pretty face in jade
Played the carnival parade

Cherise was dressing as Pirouette in white
When a fatal vision gripped her tight
Cherise beware tonight
Reuben, Reuben, tell me truly true
I feel afraid and I don't know why I do
Is there another girl for you?

If you could see my heart, you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul
If I lie, may I fall down cold

Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
The breeze would pause to listen in
Before going on its way again
Masquerade began when nightfall finally woke
Like waves against the bandstand, dancers broke
To the painted mandolin

Looking out on the crowd, who is standing there
Sweet Ruby Claire at Reuben stared, at Reuben stared
She was dressed as Pirouette in red
And her hair hung gently down

The crowd pressed round, Ruby stood as though alone
Reuben's song took on a different tone
And he played it just for her
The song that he played was the carnival parade
Each note cut a thread of Cherise's fate
It cut through like a blade

Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
When Ruby froze and turned to stone
For the strings played all alone
The voice of Cherise from the face of the mandolin
Singing Reuben, Reuben tell me true
For I have no one but you

If you could see my heart, you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul
If I lie, may I fall down cold

The truth of love an unsung song must tell
The course of love must follow blind
Without a look behind
Reuben walked the streets of New Orleans 'til dawn
Cherise so lightly in his arms
And her hair hung gently down

Al mondo antico, chiuso nel suo cuore

Nei pascoli sui monti
A una spanna dal \""regno dei cieli\""

E un gruzzolo di soldi per caso ereditò

Da fare girar la testa!
Scoppiarono i mortaretti
Si fecero dei banchetti!

Che gioia nel paese
Per quelle pazza spese.Uno scialle, una radio, un coltello
E una macchina rossa per se!

I suoi nemici per prendere i suoi soldi
Lo fan passar per matto
E lui che fa!
Si riprende le pecore e il cane
Gli amici sempre pronti
E torna là sui monti
Nella casa più grande del mondo
Che soffitto e pareti non ha!

Difendi, difendi la tua libertà!la libertà!

Quit starin' at me like an infrared nigga

Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on


Pictures of penny, sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my semi—automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact, 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire, niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the crack out, my lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Niggas pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, it’s fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war, livin' sucka free, get wit' me

The pedal to the metal, so I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road
They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go
They close down the projects the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas breakin' down o's
I'm a run away slave
Ya get it nigga off the chain
I got that thug life shit runnin' through my veins
And now they scare, they know that I been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president
But look at us, we ain't got shit to lose
Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home
This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat
So don't fall asleep
Come on niggas

62 hours and countin', and I'm still awake
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills, wit' the will I break
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media 'cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate, when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
I'm takin' back my money counter 'cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
I got a couple problems  and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the Ruger
To live like Freddy Krueger these nightmares just ain't as bloody
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is
 money talks so I always have words to answer this 
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetti activist
Might see me on TV never a mat-tress

Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Uh


Now here’s a story ’bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin’ quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
“What would you do if it was you?”
Couldn’t answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn’t picture three crazed niggas grabbin’ me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord come and take me
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn’t me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin’ with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies


Baby please don’t cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up

Because a lot of people don't like me
Tell me... What's wrong?


They wanna bury me, I'm worried, I'm losin' my mind
Look down the barrel of my 9, and my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me, unfortunately, ‘cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless
I'm chokin' off marijuana smoke
With every toke it's like I'm losin' focus
Fallin' asleep while I'm in service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous, because I'm high
Don't mention funerals, I'm stressin' and goin' nutty
And reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
I wonder: When will I be happy? Ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money
Where am I goin'? I discovered, can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it
Everybody's dyin', am I next? Who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin'?
Two to the head while I'm in bed
Leakin' blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller?
I'm gettin' suspicious of this bitch
The line's busy every time I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later!
To all the players, watch the fly way a nigga played her
This bitch is tellin' all her homies
That I can fuck her like no other
Now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure, gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drank a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies, they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the 5-0's roll, the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
I put up my middle finger, then I dash
Niggas don't like me, ‘cause I'm thuggin'
And every day I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid


If I know that in this hotel room, they have food everyday
And i'm knocking on the door everyday... to eat
And they tell - they open the door
Let me see the- the party
Let me see like them throwing salami all over
I- I mean just like- throwing food around...
But they're telling me ""there's no food in here""--
You know what i'm saying?
Everyday, I'm standing outside trying to SING my way in-
You know what i'm saying?
""We are hungry please let us in'""
""We are hungry please let us in""
After about a week that song is gonna change to...
""We hungry, we need some food""
After two/three weeks it's like, you know...
""Gimmie all the food or we're breaking down the door""
And after a year then you just like
You know what I’m saying, I’m picking the lock
Coming through the door blasting
You know what I’m saying?
It’s like you hungry, you reached your level
You don’t want anymore
We asked 10 years ago
We was asking with the Panthers
We was asking with them, the Civil Rights Movement
We was asking you know
Now those people that asked are all dead and in jail
So now what do you think we're gonna do?
Ask?


They wanna bury me, I'm worried—no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest, I'm losin' homies—ain't that a bitch?
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord, are you there?
Then tell me, am I lost? ‘Cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends, but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run, I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound
Well, Hell can't be worse than this, ‘cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you, I don't want to, but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin' MAC
-11, ‘cause in Heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin' you now: ''You motherfuckers don't know me''


I ain't scared to die... I ain't scared to die
Only fear of death...
Only fear of death...
Only fear of death...
The controversy over Death Row Records
And its owner.. being sort of a gangster
Everybody's asking about Death Row
Suge ain't no gangsta. He's chilling
No? No man, Suge a rider
I know what good morals are
But you're supposed to disregard good morals
When you're living in a crazy, bad world
If you're in hell,how can you live like an angel?
You're surrounded by devils, trying to be an angel?
That's like suicide

You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God
Without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano
I can almost hear those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid


You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty

The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
'Cause the faithful man that you loved
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground


And left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""

And I'm sure you've made it there
But as for me without your love, girl
I don't have a prayer

Meet me down at the old cafe
I jumped into the shower
I was getting my marching orders

Step into my office, baby

And catch up with the office wag
I'll be in bed by nine

My thoughts composed
I get to work on time

But my strength is in administration
I took down all she said
I even took down her little red dress

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby

I've been pushing now for days

My output is in decline
I was burned out after Thatcher
My banner I laid down with a sigh
Now I doubt if I'll ever catch her

I've got to change my ways
Dress for business every day
A smart suit and a kipper tie
A big arrow pointing to my fly

Have you shaved for work yet baby

So we see a little differently
I guess that in the end it wasn't meant to be
But we built this thing together
And I hope it stays there forever
If I could ever ask for anything
It's only that you smile when you remember me
'Cause we built this thing together
And I hope it stays there forever


I guess it’s time to let the credits roll
Starting over is incredible
The performance of my lifetime, your story isn’t like mine
Shedding light on my actions, are the cameras on?
In the beginning, it was Christon
You may read the story and think it’s fiction
Been a singer and spitter before they ever did it
I make friends, but often stand alone
Talent show singing Boyz II Men I was Wanya
But as soon as the beat dropped I was Andre
Kirk hit me before he went to see Kanye
I told him don’t even worry, just do what God say
Rest in peace to my Aunt Kay
And now Shana is my fiancé
In 2007 I named Blue, In 2012 she came true
Listen, hear, don’t just listen here
For me and her mother, it’s been a different year
It’ll take a pen to tell her how we disappeared
Cause if it’s magic, why can’t it be everlasting
God almighty, help me move past this


So we see a little differently
I guess that in the end it wasn't meant to be
But we built this thing together
And I hope it stays there forever
If I could ever ask for anything
It's only that you smile when you remember me
'Cause we built this thing together
And I hope it stays there forever


I shall not, carry the weight of the world again
So welcome to the new genre, soundtrack to my life’s drama
In real time just watch us
And in the square circle I’m in, I don’t fit, I don’t blend
Can’t pretend like I always know what I’m doing
This ain’t black and white, we all hue-man
Church I am not your modern day model
I make trends for everybody to follow
I feel more like David than the apostles
But the giants we facin' are more colossal
It’s like we made our own race and turned hostile
Yo, what’s the difference between Christian and Gospel?
And if you quote the Old Testament, you’re a fossil?
False teaching gotta listen with your nostrils
Me and Shab exposing our Tomfoolery
The cool kids ain’t cool to me
Too much to maneuver through
I kept it simple cause I needed to
And never bite the hand that’s been feeding you
So when you look for someone to pledge your allegiance to
Make sure they believe in you, All Amour


So we see a little differently
I guess that in the end it wasn't meant to be
But we built this thing together
And I hope it stays there forever
If I could ever ask for anything
It's only that you smile when you remember me

Love is a Verb
It ain't a thing


It's not something you hold
It's not something you scream
When you show me love
I don't need your words


Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb


Love ain't a crutch
It's not an excuse
No you can't get through love
On just a pile of IOU's

Love ain't a drug
Despite what you've heard


Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing

So you've got to show me, show me, show me

When the frantic pace of life attacks me
And weighs me to the ground
I long for someplace to escape
To the one place i have found
No stoplights to obey
No signs or limits there
Just drop the hook
And make your home almost anywhere


Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong


The gentle motion of the seas
Just rocks me off to sleep
No sirens, cars or screams
Just quiet ocean breeze
A frigate bird encircles me
A 1000 feet above
She dips her wing and bows her head
Like we share a common love




When the moonlight cracks the edge of night
And stars are everywhere
I can taste the rum and coke
And I can smell that salty air
A light spray across my bow
Cools the evening sun
As it slowly melts into the sea
And tells me day is done




When the common themes of life
They come and overload my brain
I steer my thoughts right to that place
That takes me far away
When the traffic fills that concrete path
That takes me back and forth
I usually sit and dream about
That biggest piece of earth


Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong


Yeah, that's where I belong
Oh, that's where I belong

I'm not a regular person


Done with the perkys
I don't even feel like it's working
I was playing the bench, I was lurking
On the block where they plotting on murking
You don't even know I was hurting
I was fucked up, a bitch had me hurting
And I think she did it on purpose
I can't fuck with the hate, I'm allergic
I feel like they had me on standby
See the pain in my damn eyes
I got out of jail and my mans died
I never sleep, I'm a vampire
I'm not a regular person
I can't be giving out verses
I'm making the industry nervous
I'm still working through all the disturbance
I'm done with these Balenciagas
They keep on fucking my socks up
Nothing but foreigns behind us
We used to pull up in the Honda
Now every time that we pop up
We got to pull up in designer
We doing it just to remind us
To never go back to the bottom
They started off hating on me
Everybody debating on me
A nigga wrote a statement on me
My life, they want to take it from me
So I got a .380 on me
It ain't never on safety, I be
Having all of this paper on me
I just hope you praying for me
I can tell you what happened
The streets turned me into a savage
I started off juggin' and trapping
Watch a couple a niggas get blasted
Way too much blood for a napkin
Won't nobody tell you what happened
I'm good when you see me in traffic
Automatic in the Benz 4matic
In the S550 I'm speeding
Nigga you wouldn't believe it
I came up from nothing I mean it
Now I'm living everything I was dreaming
I'm killing, I feel like I'm cheating
They kept on giving me reasons
Can't nobody get in between us
Only us, I put that on everything


Fuck it up, fuck it up now

I was down but I'm up now
Fuck around with them fuck 'rounds
Ain't no pounds or ""what's ups"" now

I get fly on any different occasion
I be in and out of different locations

Had to move out my mama's crib
Had to put in overtime for this

Che cos'è una finta questa lotta che fate
O forse, o forse come si dice, è solo un fuoco di Puglia
Tanto per alleggerirvi un po' da quella noia che vi sta
Squagliando, sì?

Parlato:
""Senti, ve, non ci rompere i coglioni!""
""Cazzo vuole questo!""

Ma io che sono il re degli ignoranti...; sì io
Io conosco questo senso e non l'ho dimenticato

Mentre invece voi
A furia di studiar
Solo con la mente
Avete tutti smarrito la via del cuor
Restando lì
A scavar nel vuoto
Mentre i vostri padri
Con la scure in mano
Distruggevano
La saggezza dei vostri nonni

Non è soltanto di spazio che avete bisogno
Ma del respiro delle pietre con le quali si è interrotto
Un dialogo antico oppure di udire il brontolio di un tuono lontano
O il rumore di un torrente che fa rotolare i sassi
Ecco di cosa avete bisogno: dell'arte... dell'arte di tutto ciò
Che era bello, prima che i vostri padri la distruggessero per
Regalarvi una Ferrari...

Quando noi ignoranti
Eravamo di più
In quel tempo ricordo che
Tutto era più bello
E le vecchie strade libere
Dalla schiavitù delle automobili
Quando l'acqua del mar
Era limpida e blu
Ed era bello passeggiar dentro quella città
Che dovete voi
Ricostruire prima che:

You and me got a street thing going on


Now that we have come to know each other
I'll never go away, love will always stay here forever
Cause this thing we've got is very rare

No, because

A street kinda thing going on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't going nowhere
It's gonna stay right here
Right here forever

I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day


Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep, the sounds awake me
I let them take me



Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry




Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day


Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me



Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry




Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when the day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak

"Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night
With bruised arms and broken rhythm in a beat-up old Buick
But dressed just like dynamite
He tried selling his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street
But they sighed ""Johnny it falls apart so easy
And you know hearts these days are cheap""
And the pimps swung their axes and said
""Johnny you're a cheater""
Well the pimps swung their axes and said
""Johnny you're a liar""
And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice
Said, ""Johnny don't cry""
Puerto Rican Jane, oh won't you tell me what's your name
I want to drive you down to the other side of town
Where paradise ain't so crowded
There'll be action going down on Shanty Lane tonight
All them golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch fight
Pull .38s and kiss the girls good night

Oh good night, it's alright Jane
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame
We may find it out on the street tonight baby
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe

Well like a cool Romeo he made his moves
Oh she looked so fine
Like a late Juliet she knew he'd never be true
But then she didn't really mind
Upstairs a band was playing
The singer was singing something about going home
She whispered, ""Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight
But just don't leave me alone""

And Johnny cried ""Puerto Rican Jane
Word is down the cops have found the vein""
Oh them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods
Them little barefoot street boys they say homes ain't no good
They left the corners
Threw away all their switchblade knives
And kissed each other good-bye

Johnny was sitting on the fire escape
Watching the kids playing down the street
He called down ""Hey little heroes
Summer's long but I guess it ain't very sweet around here anymore""
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on
And the sister prays for lost souls
Then breaks down in the chapel after everyone's gone

Jane moves over to share her pillow
But opens her eyes to see Johnny up and putting his clothes on
She says ""Those romantic young boys
All they ever want to do is fight""
Those romantic young boys
They're calling through the window
""Hey Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?""
And Johnny whispered:
Good night, it's all tight Jane
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane
We may find it out on the street tonight baby
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe

Ah good night, it's all right Jane
I'm gonna meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane
Ah we can find it out on the street tonight baby
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe

Ah, good night, it's all right Jane
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane
Now we may find it out on, on the street tonight baby
Or we may have to walk until the morning light maybe

Bust a bitch ass, need four more Percs

What happened to you? 
Laughing at you for havin' to shoot
Sawed off will take off a fraction of you, lack of the views 
Mad that your boo blew her back in the coupe
I was 16, sellin' crack by the school
Needing the cash, or the racks that I blew 
Look in the mirror, who nicer to you?
Biting my style like Tyson would do


Ayy, slide up in the cut
Better knuck, better buck
We don't duck, bitch, what's up?
We don't duck, bitch, what's up?

That shit I'll take to the grave 


Boy, fuck you thought?
Nigga, my hands don't talk
Nigga, my bite don't bark
Fuck you thought? Nigga, you ain't no star
You slide up and get lockjaw
I came to the block, I paid for the Glock
Gunshot, gunshot, one time, one time
I paid for the rocks, I stuffed the socks
One sale, one sale, top-notch, top-notch
I run up on nigga, go ape on a nigga
No face, no chase, no trace on a nigga
Black switchblade to the face of a nigga
Never ever will I catch a fade from a nigga
Scum Squad, don't know y'all
You face, I'll split y'all
Get pieced up, no Jigsaw
Run up wrong, get hit

Draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, nobody but me

You better
Please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart

I don't want to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing
All my happiness
For, I love a man
Who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so

Draw back your bow

His love strong for me
I swear I'm going to love him

I know that 'tween the both of us
His heart we can steal

He shows every sign of leaving her behind
After three days staying out late
It don't look like he'll be coming home tonight
She wants to cry but pride won't let her
She'll find better things to do
Leaves her key inside the mailbox
With a note that tells that cowboy where to go
It's a two day drive to Denver
With a U-Haul if she doesn't take it slow
She wants to cry but pride won't let her
She'll find better things to do


Don't let Dallas see you crying
She reminds herself as she rolls out of town
When she hits that Texas border she sets pride aside
And lets her tears come down
Then she cries all the way to Colorado
Because it hurts like the devil to be free


Cuts her hair and finds a new job
And her friends all tell her girl you're doing fine
Still the nights get cold and lonely
When that wild west Texas cowboy haunts her mind
She wants to cry but pride won't let her
She'll find better things to do

Is hoping that you might decide not to stay away

You, my friend
You're a lot like them
But I caught your lie
And you know I did
Now I'm lost in you
Like I always do
And I'll die to win
Cause I'm born to lose

Could you shine your light?
Now I love your ways
'Cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified
As I fall in line
And it's hard to try
When you're open wide


Take my hand
We'll be off and then
We'll come back again
To a different land
Now I like this way
You can go away
If you guess the name
You cannot replace

Could you shine your light?
Now I love your ways
'Cause they're just like mine

Lay them before me
And walk away
Walk away
Walk away!

So you lost, my friend
Such a sorry end
And I don't know why
So I choke and smile

"You're the glue that holds me
The one that makes me strong
You were there and I can see
To choose the right from wrong
I'm with you for always
For us they'll be no end
You're all my dreams
For all my days
My lover and my friend
And I'll make sure
That you'll stay mine
By being kind to you
I'll never cross that cheating line
And never be untrue
And you don't have to worry
You'll stay so far above
Just know its you that keeps me going
And you get all my love

No one makes me feel right
The way I do with you
Its forever that we'll be tight
A tie you can't undo
By looking hard both near and far
Its happiness I have found
I'm way up on the highest star
And haven't hit the ground
And I'll make sure that you'll be mine
By being kind to you
I'll never cross that cheating line
And never be untrue
And you don't have to worry

We laughed and joked in the cab of his truck
Just my brother and me
The night before he shipped out overseas
A leatherneck, Jarhead Marine


He said ""the Radiator leaks
And the timing-belt is worn
But the Heart and Soul of this old beat up truck
Is The Dashboard.""


""It's seen a lot of tan legs
Got a kick ass radio
Heard a lot of singing along with some country songs
And rock and roll
Got a .38 bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad
A lot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs.""
He said ""If I don't come back
You can have this Ford
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard.""


He said ""The paint is peeling off
It's got dents in both the doors
If something happens to me
Don't hang a for-sale sign above the dashboard.""

Wake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a race
That is part of a clan
And to live on highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so clean


When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be free


Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans


Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman...

It's a time wrought with fear
It's a land wrought with change
If our ancestors could hear
What is happening now
They would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has been written in chains


And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what I want
I am the clansman


And I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
Be taken alive
And I know that we'll stand

Will be born free

It's cold in the winter, baby
And I don't know when I'm coming home
The moon is shine, under the sun
Let me walk, you can run
Something tells me you're not the one
Maybe you just don't understand
So why you wonder where I keep my gun
It's in my 40 Below's


I like chicks in spandex and lumberjacks
No hat to match, razorblade in the doobie rack
Just in case a bitch act, she get her wig pushed back
Catch a fucking bullet like Warren Sapp
Cause she stay with the mac, and fuck a backpack
She rather roll up on 5-6 and headcrack
And her mom always catching fucking heart attacks
Talking 'bout, ""Fuck D Ferg, he ain't worth splat!""
Cause I dropped out of school and I drop slack
Missed work, gotta get up and hear my moms yap
Just 7.15 ain't doing it
Seeing niggas chrome-out 6, and they doing it
You see the street got corners and they using it
Momma told me not to be a fool and don't loose the shit
It's cold, 40 below, gun in the boot and shit
Ready start shooting shit, like I'm Bishop Juice'n it
And you don't want to end up like Steve
With steel to your grill because you didn't wanna fucking peel
Shit is real that I kick, I'm dead broke
Can't afford to smoke so I get high off of lead choke


Have you met Mr. Lee, oh, you gotsa meet her
Back shots off the meter and the hair adds to her features
She don't wear sneakers and she don't like reefer
Classy-ass bitch and she know when I kiss her
Love when I pull her hair low when I beat her
Hit it from the back and she sing like Aretha
First black nigga that she ever pursue
She loved my dick game, and chilling with the crew
It's true, we met back in junior high school
But didn't pursue to knocking boots, but she the truth
So I respect her, Beretta in the lever
Just in case a bitch is getting clever, however
She do what I tell her, make me a grilled cheese
She ask, ""Babe, swiss or mozzarella?"" She 'bout tell her
Versace hottie mami grimy with the body
But won't hesitate to drop a body for her papi

No Limit soldier with a bunch of little tanks

Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax

Walking down the corridor
Looking out the picture window down
On Sycamore

While perspective lines converge
Rows of cars and buses merge
All the sweet green trees of Atlanta burst
Like little bombs

Shaken by a careless hand
That drives them off
And leaves again

Life just kind of empties out
Less a deluge than a drought
Less a giant mushroom cloud
Than an unexploded shell
Inside a cell

Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes


Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day


Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime

The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

Where all I had to worry bout was school and if I had a pimple
Now everybody looking up to me like I'm God
And I'm tryna be the man but I can't put up no facade
It's a sacrifice out here leading
Tryna patch people's wounds when yourself still bleeding
Everything falls down I wonder who see us
Boom boom pow like onomatopoeia
Onomatopoeia I been on my job
Scary thing is I been feeling like Tom
Lord is my shepherd I been reading in Psalms 
Need to feel God in my feet and my palms
I feel like I'm overprotective because I'm scared of getting hurt
Cause it's like time and time again the hurt is getting worse
I feel I'm cursed cause people lied to me so much I can't relax
Every time I'm tryna level up the devil on my back

On top of that my homeboy passed last week
Long live 22 that's how fast life be
Then I step out to a show and get a call from my sis
She said a dude hung himself in school he only in the sixth

No one to call to heaven's goal

I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit

When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh
And now Bush can't stop the hit

And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas

One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The Penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas

Lettin' my tats show and I sag my pants
Im letting my ass show, I'm hot as tabasco
I study, Castro, yeah, my plug from Cuba
Inside of the car is like a damn computer
Inside of the crib is like a damn museum
You ain't seen these before, you better get 'em on film
Tryin to take these fat pockets, man your chances are slim
Disrespect, you stomp em out, man give em a Tim
You ain't did what I did, see I know I'mma win
And they dont have slow-motion so I did it again
Woah!


Im getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!


Okay I'm sittin' on the plane, flying over graves
I am so high, nigga I can talk to rain
My outfit's insane, ain't that evident?
My chain had another chain like it was pregnant
My favorite dish is turkey lasagna
Even my pajamas designer
She got a fat ass I make her rewind
Back seat so big I press recline
Got a dirty sprite in my cup holder
Rappers like road kill, they get run over
They get done over, it's just one solider
This flow will make you fall like its October
Me and your girl, nigga opposite of sober
Celine Paris chain charm look like a cobra
Young Casanova, Baby Romeo
I got my girl geeked, she look like she from Tokyo

I come from the heart of the Heartland
Where pictures shows where the corn grows
In rows and rows of summer greens
And winter snows
And it goes on
Through the crack of the bat
Oh everybody rollin' out their welcome mat
And our hands on our hearts under the stars of the Friday night flag


And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh from Illinois


I remember the first time
I saw that name on the marquee sign
Lights so bright could almost make you blind
I'd get lost in
Sweet girls singin' along
Buses rollin' on in the silver dawn
Seein' the world a long, long way from home


And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh oh oh


It's water through my blood
It's the place I got my roots
It's the fire that's in my soul
It's the mud that's on my boots
Oooh Illinois


Oh oh oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy

"I was born when they took my name
When the world turned wicked, when I joined their game
But I turned and fought them, like you always knew I'd do

I sat and dreamed at the foot of your bed
You split my skull and reached inside my head
And pulled out the pictures I'd been wishing I'd forget

And you stitched me up then
And wiped the blood from off my chin

Now I sit on the rooftop's edge
The muddy street beneath my swollen head
Trying to forget you, to believe we'd never met

And the sky is wrecked; full of rotting clouds
From chimney mouths spewing smoke around
And I can't stop coughing
My lungs just won't calm down

But I still keep grinning
As the blood from my face stains the ground

A bird, caught in the wires, bleating for help I can't provide
I'm not that big
I hope for the best, but nothing changes
I'm sorry
But I was blessed with bad eyes
There's a lot that I miss, but I don't mind
I'm not that old
I'll find out what broke me soon enough

Because something is happening here

And you ask ""Is this where it is?""
And somebody points to you and says
""It's his""
And you say ""What's mine?""
And somebody else says ""Well, what is?""
And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""


But something is happening
And ya' don't know what it is

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says ""How does it feel to
Be such a freak?""
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone


And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is

Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organization
Aw, you've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known


But something is happening here
And ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?


Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""


And you know something is happening
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?


Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""Now""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back ""You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home""

But ya' don't know what it is

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket

Remember that you set your course

To defy all that can't bring us down
United standing strong

Make sure that you take back control

Now your reaching for your sanity but your afraid of me...

Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind


Posted up perpendicular, criminal curricular
Versatile, nah nigga's style is similar
You know the signature, Louis V graffiti wear
Foolishly to believe niggas could see me here
Greek platters, sitting like how I eat matters
Sip so much Cris' I got a weak bladder
Speak dapper, dummies call me the deep rapper
Bitches bow and allow a nigga to beat faster
Breathe after I'm gone gracing the mic
Indeed it's fashion and pawn, a day in the life
Been a beast since the octopus break beats
Way before the V-Twizzy came with the suede seats
Years before Nas verse released and his tape leaked
I was right there in Chesapeake like 8 deep for 80 weeks
Crazy Jeeps, candy coupes, a baby freak
Fornicating, fucking broads on the day we meet
From DC to VA Beach, down in NC
Fuck police, nigga, stay in the beef
Blaze and creep, analyze, display conceit
Sex sanitize, interchange the seats
I'm elite, niggas need to listen when I speak
I can lift you off your feet or position you to eat


Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind


Closed caption, chose in rose rapping
Exposed to the cold, got a cloth and dove back in
From stove action to spitting the flow flashing
From dough stacking to having them hoes yapping
No rations, Rollies, I'm old fashioned
And more macking for doley homie, what's happening?
In that 4 door, '84s on decor
More fly than the day before, for sure
Bonjour, blowing kisses at the pretty women
A connoisseur with the kicks and the crispy denim
Stay winning, puffing spliffs to the 5th dimension
Politicing from a pimp's position, persistent
All wrist wear, water resistant
Get it clear, niggas auras' different, I'm all vintage
A crook off a verse and a hook
I'm in the books when it's smooth as an inside jux

Every star will fall out of the sky
And every mountain will tumble down
And every river run dry

For every tear that ever fell
And never made a sound

With nails as sharp as Diana Dors
Watching us is stopping you
From cruising Ugly Avenue

Pretty, look young be fearless
Like the Scorpion
Pretty, look young be fearless
Like the Scorpion
The Scorpion
The Scorpion

And if by chance you cling to hate
Just rest assured it's your mistake

Hold up your head, you know I'm right
The street's the place, tonight's the night
The night
The night look pretty, look young be fearless like the Scorpion
The night look pretty have fun, don't listen when you're told there's none...

Put a nigga in the black Nissan 
I'm that nigga Freddy wouldn't sleep on
Catch a nigga in the bushes doing recon 
Cops found a body in the alley 
Gotta rock the club like a caddie 
I'ma push your button like an innie 
Switch it up and then I head to Cali 
Chop another bitch nigga up 
Put them body parts in the bag 
Put them body parts in the concrete 
Spread the concrete across the whole city 
Plug a nigga up like a damn MIDI 
Voice in my head, got too many 
Hit you with the metal like I'm Yung Simmie 
I'ma kill everybody how they do Kenny 
'Cause I go hard like Timmy! 
Nigga wanna talk about a nigga like Jimmy, Neutron
Told you don't mess with the Z-Eltron
Banish my demon, using a seance
Goddamn nigga, wanna talk about you
Put yo' ass in the ICU
Intensive Care Unit if a nigga keep shootin', bitch!

Uh, made it past twenty-five

Bet you respect me when I check in with that .45 
Slide , ride , this a homicide 
Pull up to the side, let that man retire
I ain't Drake, this ain't 6ix, issa 9ine
Sticky, blicky, iron 
Heard you fuck with swine? 
That ain't my kind
Fuck who you run to, keep it tucked, you know my chopper shy
When it cries, it cries
If you die, you die, pussy, meet the sky
Rappers telling lies 
ACOG, too hard, write a hit like Akon
Heard you talking shit on Twitter, 40 make 'em log off
Know my presence makes you bitter
Bitch, you better be cautious
It's nasty

Put your black ass in a duffle bag
And slide off in the hopes, it's a closed casket
My presence alone can exterminate masses
The tongue speak spells, cause blazing rashes 
Like who gonna go and betray the beast?
Like who gonna go and start war with me? 
Nigga, who gonna go and betray the Zii?
Godzilla , go start a feast
It's the wardog, sup 
Five-star general, ten-hut 
In the bottom of my hell, I clutch 
Hands covered in blood and rust 
No nigga can take my soul 
Drop dead, them heads will roll 
We'll drop the corpse in the cold 
War dog, I'll stick to the code 
Ayy, now I'm muddy booted , redrumin' 
Body baggin' , head huntin' , police siren , fence jumpin' 
Black metal , gun bustin' 
Wardog bitch , we gon' tape up our fists 
We the wardogs bitch , wear our rank on our wrist

Going crazy my heart is breaking
I can't sleep at all
Trying to get through this
Don't know how I'll do this
I know that I only got my self to blame 
But that doesn't help to ease the pain 
I'll just die if I can't see your face


Until you come back
I can't breathe
Until you come back
I got no reason
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees
I still need you beside me


Now it's morning
Your still gone and
I still reach for you 
Don't know how to
Live without you
I wish I can take back all the hurt I've caused

If I could give back all the love I lost

The price I pay is just too high of a cost yea


Until you come back
I can't breathe
Until you come back
I got no reason
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees
I still need you beside me


Please forgive me 
Let me have one more chance in your life 
Till your with me
I'll be half alive until you come back 


Until you come back
I can't breathe
Until you come back
I got no reason
Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees
Cause I need you beside me


Until you come back
I can't breathe
Until you come back

Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees

With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride


We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise


Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?


You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine


We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
I said ""He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is

But there was fear inside
A witty line to save my face
The parachute of pride

To cross a line, takes a tiny step
But will this spark, cause the bridge to burn
My fear entwined with my regret
I'll beat the path of safe return

There's a thing called love
That we all forget
And it's a wasted love
That we all regret

You live your life just once
So don't forget about a thing called love
Don't forget, forget about a thing called love

So here we are, all just the same
And you will never know
My secret plan, how close we came
To share another road

Have I lost my only chance
To tell you how I feel inside
Is it just me, I'd like to know?
Or are we all just a little blind?

And it's a wasted love

When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' never seen before
I say, ""Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her""

I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her

Or what about her style? 
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

What's going on with my rap pages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm, come on
It's the Abstract, Will is on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world
You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in there for my Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it, be marvelled of the speakers please
'Cause they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break atoms, break a sound
Thunder and bass full pound
Streets with the things profound
If you wanna do to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it can help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out

Steady jumpin' round like it's heavy cargo
 Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tonto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
Kobe showed the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we Wells Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke herbs but I'm still real nice with the verbs

When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd o'cattle down Myrtle Avenue

Bring all the spaces together
And all the silences ever
Bring all the spaces together

Come close again
Be my pause before the end
I miss you, oh, like a fading dream
And I have a feeling you know what I mean

Looking at pictures
The taste, the smell
Not the friends

And in our old kitchen
Record player never ends
They were once
But now no more
You know that it's real
And they were before
Nothing said and silence gained
And my body grows but heart lays

Blink hard and set it to ink
These items fade faster than you think
Feelin' low in a major key
Do they remember me now that it's one year A.D?

Bring all the spaces together
And all the silences ever
Bring all the spaces together

Build all the silences up

I spoke to God today
And she said that she's ashamed
What have I become?
What have I done?
I spoke to the devil today
And he swears he's not to blame
And I understood
'Cause I feel the same


Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side... the righteous side of Hell


I heard from God today
And she sounded just like me
What have I done
And who have I become
I saw the devil today
And he looked a lot like me
I looked away
I turned away


Arms wide open

I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side... the righteous side of Hell




I'm not defending
Downward descending
Falling further and further away
Getting closer every day
I'm getting closer every day
To the end
To the end, the end, the end
I'm getting...) closer every day


Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone

Straight outta hell, ring the bells, Plague is here to stay
Roaches and locusts, they cover me
No halo hovering, follow me in yo' grave
Ain't got no Patek because I'll be here 'till the end of fucking times
Thy kingdom come; thy will be done
And still you wonder, ""who am I?""
I am the devil's son, born and raised
Preaching $uicide, googly eyes
""Tell me more!""—okay
Praise the fucking devil, God can suck my dick
I scorch the plains
Making mountains crumble, glaciers meltin', oceans swellin'

Hanging from the doorframe with sores and stains

On your blood-stained wood floor, you know, mister typical
Hearin' the fucking voices through my window

But no worries
Just like Chucky, Cut Throat got the blade, and the knife
May thy rise for the Yung Christ—never even died
My father has forsaken I
I'm still $uicide until I die
It's an eye for an eye
Speaking of I, I— 
See the reaper having a busy season
Won't even let me rest, while I'm sleeping
It's gettin' harder to watch from the bleachers
The father of evil
Like Knievel, Ruby and I stay jumping over people
Xanax eatin', close to lethal
Cigarette breathin' junkie, used to needles

How did we get to my place?
After last night I'm looking for steps to trace
All I know is we made love all over my place
And that's all I can remember but my condo give the play by play


It started when I seen all of the bottles of Patrón
Empty, obvious that something crazy here went on, sex was everywhere
Whipped cream all over the counter, but she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around but the only thing I found was


Lipstick on the glass
Cause we drank, got drunk, that night we lived it up
Yeah that night we did it up
And now the only trace I found was
Lipstick on the glass
Shot after shot we got hot, and we tore it up
Now all I got left is the
Lipstick on the glass


I can still smell your perfume in my home, I can still taste the sweetness of your touch
I should ask the neighbours, maybe they know
I know they heard us loving on the night before
I'm tryna find out where you are, hope you not very far, I gotta find you girl


Where we can have another night with all these bottles of Patrón
Empty, obvious that something crazy here went on, sex was everywhere
Whipped cream all over the counter, but she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around, that's when I saw that you left

Sun dried all of the rain away
Turned the sky from blue to grey
Love if our things work out that way
So I flipped through the pages of this old photo book
I had to take a second look
Of where we’ve been and where we’ve come from
And will we miss each other in the long run


Time and time again
I wanted to please you
I didn’t think I could leave you
But I did
Time never really was a friend
I didn’t want it to end
But it did
Put it back together again
 Put it back together again


Now some hang on to “use to be’s”
I’m talkin' bout you and me
I know everything was changed
It’s like a rolling down memory lane
So my mind says yes and my heart says no
Tears roll like rivers flow
Like waves that toss and then turn rough
Wonder why a brother kicked a sister so tough 


Time and time again
I wanted to please you
I didn’t think I could leave you
But I did
Time never really was a friend

Face to face, it seems so long ago
But do we really know how far love light travels
Anybody could tell this train would derail
Feel my heartstrings unravel
Ask me do I do, do I still love ya
Although we’ve been through all of the pain we’ve been through
But only time will tell if we’ll go through more hell
Or will we love each other better than we used to

I didn’t think I could leave you

Feel the love of the season where ever you are
On the small country roads
Lined with green mistletoe

Let every heart sing
Let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year

Christmas everywhere
In the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies
Their first fallen snow
The elderly's memories that never grow old




Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing
And the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means
And what we believe
From the sandy white beaches
Where blue water rolls
Snow covered mountains and valleys below

And so the story goes, they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the goodmen tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicely shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss


Sighing they swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions


I was stone and he was wax
So he could scream and still relax
Unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru our veins and lo! It was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote cannot be found today


And it was stalking time for the moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
And the Devil may be here
But he can't sing about that
Oh, and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers


Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead, he could be not, he could be you
He's chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature


Shooting up pie-in-the-sky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone
Kings of oblivion
We were so turned on
In the mind-warp pavilion


Lay me place and bake me pie
I'm starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey

Just for the day, hey
Please come away, hey
Just for the day, hey
Please come away, hey

Sometimes I don't wanna wake up alone

But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own

Sometimes I don't wanna walk by and smile

But at the same time, I don't wanna let people down

 Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world?
 And no one can reach you , ooh

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking


Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""


Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no


Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking


Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?


Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise

Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise

"Sugar coated love, you gave me on a plate
I took a bite and then I looked to see what I had ate
I found I had a cinder all covered up in white
That old sugar coated love is something I can't bite

You say you are leaving me for another man
He has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
Baby I fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
Can't understand what I saw in a sugar coated love

You called me your sugar plum, your baby and your pet
Said I was your Romeo and you my Juliet
I thought you were my angel, my little sugar dove
You sure had me fooled, babe, with that sugar coated love

Part of me won't go away
Everyday, reminded how much I hate it
Weighed it against the consequences
Can't live without it, so it‘s senseless

Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with the gaping hole
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place

Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
You hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are

And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I rather not even be
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me


Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!


I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me




Once it's been dealt with
You feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be

Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see another piece
Of yourself that you can't let be

Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know you can choose
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise

You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you!


Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!


I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me




This part of me won't go away! 

Part of me won't go away! 



Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me


I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

I feel it everyday
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

I can hear a heartbeat, it seems a little strong
I can hear the things that I did wrong
I can hear a song by looking in her eyes
I can hear all the times she cried
I can hear the memory as they echo off the wall
Falling from the pictures down the hall
I can hear regret building up inside of me
I can hear all them things I could not see


Those are the sounds of a woman leaving
Stronger than a wind in the willow tree
Those are the sounds of a heart breaking
You can't hear it but the noise is killing me


I should have heard it coming but I chose to pretend
I should have recognized That sound way back then
But I just wouldn't listen
And didn't want to all those years
Now the truth is is ringing clear
In my ears




Those are the sounds of a heart breaking
You can't hear it but the noise is killing me
I can hear it
And the silence is killing me

"Inside my loneliness and sorting through the mess
I came across a bunch of snaps and letters
I found an eight by ten, taken God knows when
It took me back to when we found each other
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
The tender parts we played
I thought we had it made
The recipe for life, the perfect fusion
But when the love turned sour
I found the happy hour
But drinking for the world is no solution
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Why did I break your heart
The cost of loving is a heavy burden
Somebody's gotta take the strain
The things we said would make a cover story
But who's gonna say
Who should take all the blame
We analysed ourselves
It didn't really help
No one to referee, no rhyme no reason
I thought we had the best
But when you flew the nest
My heart decided it was open season
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Why did I break your heart.....

See I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B singers
I'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker
Mask on, lone ranger, scope on the K, long ranger
Rather be alive and rich than die and be famous
Live my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything
I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing
Rims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga
Trying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame
You chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper
Niggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper

Nah, I ain't running after no broad, she stuck on my dick
I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green
She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why
Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look
There ain't a bitch more dime than me
The thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me

Catch 'em all after the club, tell 'em the ante up

You owe me, you better pay
Ghost, let the beretta spray
Hood want uncut dope and some better yay

Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass

Still popping, still slinging, still need the cash

You know what you want, but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever
When you feel you've lost your way

To fight and never walk away
So here I am still holding on

With every breath it's harder to believe
You make it through the pain

Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so then picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat

If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor

I left my wallet in El Segundo

Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it


Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate ‘em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished, we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: “Pay for lunch,” so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
""Yo Tip man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
But what do you know, my wallet I forget


I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo

A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
Come in, Mister DJ


Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts, we scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming, three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""All right, Tip, see you tomorrow”
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped’ to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said ""Why?"" I said ""We gotta go
‘Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo""


I left my wallet in El Segundo

The song bird yearns to sing a love song
The roses yearns just for the dew
The whole world's yearning for the sunshine
I have a yearning too


Yearning just for you that’s all I do my dear
Learning why I'm blue I wish that you were near
Smiles have turned to tears days have turned to years
Yearning just for you I hope that you yearn too
Smiles have turned to tears days have turned to years
Yearning just for you I hope that you yearn too

Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to the distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up


That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough


I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try


Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up


Consider this, consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this the slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said too much


I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try


But that was just a dream
That was just a dream


That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

Fire! I can feel it calling out to me

And as the sun goes down
It starts to paint a picture
Of an ancient town
So far away, across the endless sea

Lead me to the light
And take me to the edge of heaven
I am standing in the night
Looking for the edge of heaven
We'll be touching the edge of heaven

Time
Close your eyes, see dreams of tomarrow
Time
The wheels are turning 'till eternity

And as the darkness comes
I start to see a picture
Of a lonely man
So clearly now reaching out for me

Lead me to the light...

And sail the endless sea
So lead me to the light
And take me to the edge of heaven

The edge of heaven is near
We'll sail the endless sea

In the attic, in the eye of a tornado
I watch the winter tame the orchard
Tree by tree, lay them gently down
Cities that shine like El Dorado

And I can't wake it up again
Stars above you are shining roads
And no one knows quite where it goes
And I can't get to sleep again
I lay in here
In the attic, in the wind of a tornado
I watch the wind tear the walls in
And the animals, never feel so low again
Cities that shine like El Dorado
Now it's sleeping in the Shadow
And I can't wake it up again
Stars above you are shining roads
And no one knows quite where it goes
And I can't get to sleep again
Stars above you shine on cue
Now they're acting a bit confused
And I can't make them shine again

This bulletin just in... In a scene to rival the famed Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of the 1920 Chicago, Don Armatello, reputed crime lord and ten of his henchmen were gunned down...


I rock a nigga to sleep
Rock-rock-a-bye, baby
Rock-rock-a-bye, baby


You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down 
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down 


Yeah I show you my teeth all through the beef
Paint the sidewalk red with the back of your head
Shootouts in my hood like a daily routine
D's think I'm involved when a nigga hit hard
So when that hammer hit the shell and the hollow tip fly
Nigga you can cross your heart and hope not to die
Come through squash the drama, send niggas with llamas
To heat your ass up, fuck being masked up
I was given the gift of life from Sabrina
Since then, I've been jammed up and bucked with the nina
Nana raised nine kids, I turned out the meanest
I mean a menace, fuck with me and you're finished


You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down 
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down 


Homie I always pay my debts when I owe a nigga bullets
Got an arsenal, infantry and niggas to pull it
Go ahead, style on me get done with, it's nothing
I chase a nigga down and touch him, catch him and bust him
Bitch get out the way, baby while I spray it
I wet a nigga like a hydrant on a hot summer day
But you can catch me in May riding round with the 'K
Better watch what you say, we get it popping today
Yeah me I make it hot round here, I call the shots round here
I have a nigga tear off your top down here
This the land of broken hearts, where bullets shatter dreams
And everything a nigga is worth is on the triple beam, South Side!


You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down 
You should be dead by now

There are just too many
Times that people
Have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you
And I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I’ve
Held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind
Afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you’ve said about me when I’m not around
You think having the upper hand
Means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I’ve had too many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine


One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

And then it's all gone


So many people like me
Put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think
To just say what we feel inside
So many people like me
Walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want
Is to feel like I’m not stepped on
There are so many things you say
That make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall
And I’m counting down the time
'Cause I’ve had so many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I’m waiting until the upper hand is mine


One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

And then it's all gone


And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
Now it's all gone


I know I’ll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide use, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall


One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

Way easier said than done
If God is for me.. tell me what could be against
When I look around all I see is this  like..
Everyone's worried 'bout falling in love, I was in it till death
I'm in a hurry now, thinking 'bout lyrics and where does the beat slaps
So I've been running, what else is there to do?
I treat love like a crowd, I'm always pushing through


I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
I've been running 'round for a long time

Only right that I gotta go grind

I've been doing this for a long time


So excellence..
Difference between me and him is the effortless
Effort I've been putting in so I do, I go measure it
Exit this.. that I've plotting to exit this 
That I've been sitting in, so far from stopping
I should be mixing, instead I'm writing
Ignoring  on my explorer page
Yes, I've been sorta late..
Is it distorted faith?
 that my God has been fixing me something better than I could have imagined
If it was my time, I would have been average

So all of my problem, they feel like a joke


I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind

Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
But I've been feeling like I found a gold mine
Only right that I gotta go grind
It's only right that I gotta go grind
I've been doing this for a long time


So.. late nights, early mornings, cold showers
Struggle and the hustle gets my soul power
Close to my loved ones, never feeling alone
Tryna get some work done, gotta get in my zone
 started to go dry
Don't think I'm special, I'm just another guy
Tryna follow God, I don't always do it right and
Step into the light, cause the dark was the frightening

I can't stress all the things that I can not control
But when I get ahold of something as whole other things that don't matter I have to let go..
 today
 I can not escape
And it's okay really, I'ma do my part
Hoping that you feel me

I know I wasn't perfect, but I kept trying

Yeah, we lost all meaning, we lost the magic
So good luck to you on your way
Oh, you'll be the end of me

And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
Cause oh, you'll be the end of me


I get it, no, I get it
Gave more than I took back, oh well

Can't help those who don't wanna be helped

One, two, one


Everyday I pray for mankind
We're all slaves to a generation socialized and sickness is in the mind
We are habitual thinkers, substance abusers and habitual drinkers
But free your mind because the plug is watching from the top floor, hoping you too would fall for the illusions of a temporary high
When we think, we need to get by
But are we really trying when kids are dying and depression is trending?
Are these the signs of an Armageddon?
We're all in denial and it's all cool until you're suicidal
We never learn from our so called idols
We're just repeating the cycle so-
I never read the news anymore, it's hard not to feel hopeless
When no one noticed, the explosion came from a man who's legal gun was loaded
It's all watered down and sugarcoated
We voted but did we really get to chose?
We don't need proof that they separate us from the truth
Mothers and fathers are being separated from their youth
And they're selling the American Dream and what it appears to be
But they don't teach us that wealth is unattainable with their currency
History, is not my brother's story
The original founders were buried in the ground where men have planted seeds of disease
And they've justified being thieves
Feeding their inner demons and blaming the minorities
It's a World War III, corruption versus greed
Not you versus me
But do we ever think, of the need for inner peace?
They can't put a price on your soul, don't matter your religion, right and wrong is something everybody knows
They pick and choose what's equal
Who's good and who's evil
And this is the devil's world but the Lord is coming for his people




We're like Daniel in the den
Surrounded by these hungry lions
Looking in the jaws of death
We reach for saving hands
No help will come from then
The Lord is coming


Well the Red Sea's closing in
There's no safety in almighty horses
Can you feel the drivn' wind?
Behold the crashing waves
The Savior's on it's way
The Lord is coming


Coming, coming
Hurry, hurry
Bring us to the promise land
Glory, glory, we'll reach for saving hands
No help will come from then
The Lord is coming


All you people of the land
Down beneath the weight of all your sorrows
Turn around while you still can
There's no guarantee you'll see tomorrow
The doors are open wide
Surrender to the light
The Lord is coming


Coming, coming
Hurry, hurry
Bring us to the promise land
Oh glory, glory, we'll reach for saving hands
No help will come from then
The Lord is coming


The Lord is coming
The Lord is coming
The Lord is coming
Glory, glory, glory
The Lord is coming

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're

No time to waste, back to my place

Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got a pal, every gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing!

Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year


Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's


True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold

I know my heart has lied before
But now it speaks, with honesty
Of an invisible bond of friendship, that was formed, in secrecy
Coming from me this may seem hard but, but to God I swear - it's truth
We are friends for eternity and for-ever I will always love.. you..


What of a love unspoken?
Is it weaker without a name?
Does love exist without a title
Because I do not share it's name?


All my life I've dreamed of
Of meeting one with immense beauty and
And once I found her I would charm her and
And she'd be mine forever 
I found her and, indeed she is all that I, wished for and more but she
Is not charmed nor intrigued 
Then I think to myself what.. can I offer her
The tears warm my eyes and blur my, vision I
Stick to my stance of bravado and give her
The same uninterested look that she, gave, me
 She was so beautiful
But what.. can I offer her?

You say that you'll love me forever but
But what about today?
As the dusks become the dawns and the years pass on will you
Love me  the same way ?
If so let us rejoice and bathe in this constant pleasure
If not spare my heart today and I shall recover before, forever
And if my doubts and questions upset you
 forgive my fragile heart
I just wanted to know if you'd love me forever before today
Would start

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me

When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?

So she wanna chew me out like suga the gum
But competition is nothin' so you really can't see me
Cause suga, I'm on a level that higher then Don Bredes
So you can eat your wheaties, Pop some suger smacks
Or sweeten up your coffee with dozen of suger packs
You still ain't no match for kid from Melby
When they sprinkle the club with more gees and suga tee
And yes indeed, he gots to be the all topsy
That killed the summer in that drop top B
So on the close n' open', forget the rope n' dough
Cause suga ain't knock em out, with the dopest quotes
Uh, uh


I’ma be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store
I’ma be like a waffle cone that’s dripping down to the floor
The way you do if for me I can’t lie 
About to be up in the mall all night 
Whatever I get you putting it on 
Don’t give me no lip let mama do it all


Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga give mama some suga mama

Do anything to keep you home

My accountant’s waiting on the phone 
Just the thought of making love to you 
Dropping everything that’s what I’ll do 
Whatever I get you putting it on 
Now take it off while I watch you perform

Aunt Mattie bent a thousand times down the long black rows
Then battled with the angry weeds so little seeds could grow
Come summer Mattie pulled the snow from cruel and cutting bolls
She was patient pale and slender and was only eight years old
Round and round the spinning wheel beneath Aunt Mattie's boot
She recalled the soil and cotton seeds and summer's hopeful shoots
Two winters spun out summer's threads in rich and creamy folds
And she had a bolt of cotton cloth when she turned ten years old


If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world


Indigo and lavender made up Aunt Mattie's sky
Remembering her childhood days she made the rustic dye
The hour before the day would end it fed young Mattie's dream
She made indigo and lavender when she turned just fourteen


If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world


Aunt Mattie bends a thousand times down each patchwork row
Piece by piece and stitch by stitch in fading candle glow
The valley of the shadow cannot call her from her seams
Until finishing her lifetime's work she dies at seventeen


If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world

Hangs in the corner
With the rest of our dissolving years
You're the storm and the calm
The dove and the bomb
Ghost that relieves all my fears

Don't let this bedroom hold
As years and sheets unfold
We'll be able to sleep on the love

The weight of the world
Is on top of me
And I wouldn't have you anywhere else
The weight of the world
Is on top of me
And I'll hold you here all myself

Like a land-worthy sailor
I am a falter and failure
Trying to find my heading back home
You're the cure and the disease
The vice I still need
Casting the break in my bones
You're the life that's worth living
The hurt and forgiving
You're Jesus to the demons you've bored in my head

The weight of the world
Is on top of me
And I wouldn't have you anywhere else

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue, up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo

Tell you a thing that you ought to know
Two minutes of your time, then on you go
Tell tale of the men all dressed in black
That most of them, not coming back
Sent off to war to play little games
And on their return, can't name no names
Some strange yellow gas has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes, removed all the lies
And strange as it sounds, death knows no bounds
How many get well?
Only time will tell
Only time will tell


You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table?
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing
To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools?
And to think that we thought you the answer


I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed, I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense, I can really see it clearly now


Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesize
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept
Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the facade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome


You had us all strung out with promises of peace
But all along, your cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now?
Only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to Hell as well


Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance, at least
Take the world to better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy you now will leave




We seemed destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life, while there's hope
That man won't self-destruct
Why can't we treat our fellow men
With more respect and a shake of their hands?
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is becoming a way of life
We live in an uncertain world
Fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones

But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know;
""Fight fire with fire, life is cheap""
But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care?
They benefit from death and pain and despair

I got money, everything that I ever wanted
Never thought of what I might need, need, need
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running
Reaching for the sky-y and coming down with nothing?


It feels like I'm four years old all over again
Because I'm just running fast but should be walking
Saying, ""When I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy""


I guess I was faking 'cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting
Reaching for the sky-y and coming down with nothing


It feels like I'm four years old all over again
'Cause I just keep running fast but should be walking
Saying, ""When I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy""


I'm so alone
I feel so alone
So alone in this world
Got everything I want


It feels like I'm four years old all over again

I'm gon' be comfortable and happy""

"Something came from nothing today
While I was saying no

Well don't you knock on my door
I can't answer you anymore

Absence makes the heart grow fond
Of staying away from people

It was a question before
But I can't answer you anymore

Skipped to the scene where we meet
And wrote a song
I did everything right for somebody that
Does everything wrong

So I go from coast to coast
Over the Hawthorn Bridge

To the one I adore
You asked me what I'm looking for
But I can't answer you anymore
No, I can't answer you anymore

Don't play with me girl, I'm the truth when it come to acting
Like me and you never happened
Tough luck right now, boo-hoo
That's enough right now
Unless you wanna fuck right now
Ain't much to discuss right now
I'ma beat it up like the beat
And this shit thump right now
It's a whole lot of bitches in the club
Don't make me choose up right now

Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose

And the punk police can't fade me and maybe
We can have peace someday, G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
Tell my brothers on the block–better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got a nigga smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when they free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, now ya boys watch ya back
'Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'mma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?

I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle ain't do nothing but blow my name up!
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble


Holler if ya hear me!

""Tellin' you to hear it""

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I kick
Representin', never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise to all my boys
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
'Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin' for the day to let the rage free
Still me 'til they kill me
I love it when they fear me


Holler if ya hear me!

Have you heard what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance
Where the darkened clouds roll
He can feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror
See an old man now
Does it matter?
They survive somehow

They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing we can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden
Looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?

Do you know what is happening to just everyone of us?
Have you heard, have you heard?

There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it
It will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

He carries everything into the shelter, not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired, that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall
It's falling down upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife
Roll down her face, saying grace

Remember times they had
They flash right through his mind, left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and wait


I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors, unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome



When they found them
Had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying nearby their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blows

My daddy was a trucker
Left home when I was three
He fell for some dude in Austin
Then it was mom and me

She always wanted a daughter
Well look at what she got
A'hit me, beat me, a faggot I ain't
But a real man they say I'm not


I'm the queen, queen of the rodeo
Queen, queen of the rodeo
So cowboy, if you're looking for loving
I ain't no queer, go fuck a steer
I think there's one over there


I drink too much, I smoke too much
I'm a human waste
I buy a lot of cheap alcohol
But I'll tell ya honey, I really hate the taste

I dressed in drag, they call me a fag
But boy, I really don't care
'Cause last night I met your girlfriend, sucker
And I hope ya like to share, 'cause she did


I'm the queen, queen of the rodeo

And the love of our faces
It never happened, you see

Or interest in astrology
But as I read, it must be so
The invulnerable word ""incompatible""

Our indifference would still show

Tonight we lie awake
Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night
Another seven days
Heartbeat racing the interstate
My home tonight
For one more long night
I'm sure as hell the happiest I've ever been


We get high, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are...


There's a ghost in this room
I think I'll name it after all of you
And watch it hang over my bed
Like decorations, celebrated
Memories, they came and went
In light of all the time we spent
Listening to everything
Our parents told us not to take in
Now make a change
I'm counting down
The mile marks to every town
And falling more in love
With the distance put between us


We get high, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are everything
Make this last, take it slow
We've got it all figured out for now
So let us live our lives without a doubt


Tonight we lie awake
Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night
Another seven days
Heartbeat racing, the interstate
My home, tonight
For one more long night


From coast to coast, I'll make the most
Of every second I've been giving with this crowd
Without a doubt, you're all I dream about
At night we lie awake with stories taking us back to
The nights we felt alive
The nights we felt alive


I would've married you in Vegas
Had you given me the chance to say, ""I do.""
Couldn't make it anymore obvious, could you?
Be anymore obvious

"I can remember stories
Those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings
Then tucked me in real tight

She turned my night light on
And kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions of perfect paradise

She told me everything
She said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him
We'd ride clean out of sight

She never said
That we would curse, cry and scream & lie
She never said that maybe
Someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise of fairy tales
Uh
No, uh, huh
Mmm, mmm

She spoke about happy endings
Of stories not like this
She said he'd slay all dragon
Defeat the evil prince

She said he'd come to save me
Swim through the stormy seas
I'd understand the story
It would be good for me

You never came to save me
You let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness
Alone in the cold

My story end as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise
No fairy tales
Yes

I don't look for pie up in the sky, baby
Need reality now
Said I don't feel the need to be pacified
Don't you try
Honey, I know you lied

You never came to save me
You let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness
Alone in the cold

I found no magic potion
No horse with wings to fly
I found the poison apple
My destiny to die

No royal kiss could save me
No magic spell to spin
My fantasy is over
My life must now begin

My story end as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise
No fairy tales

Hey, hey, eee
Mmm, mmm

Oooh
Oooh

I heard a human voice who sang like no one else
I heard a proud lady singing loud
Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn
But soon she found she was underground and wasted
I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage
Her body shook oh, she did her stuff
She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much
If you take the smooth you got to take the rough


Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid


I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd
I felt the sound shower around
And he would take you with him where no music's been before
As you merged the power surge together
His music knew no limits if you were in it's wake
You had no choice, no, but hear its voice
And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream
But once so strong survive or become weak




If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds
I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame
But fast car user lose
That legend's born from death and that is such a shame
Because every year new ones appear

There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me..

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close..
.. to the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely



Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family - love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine



Yeah.. yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh
Suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'mma lead you
And whatever's right, I'mma feed you

Why these fat niggas floatin around?
What happened to them real motherfuckin G's?

We must've been together
I bet you knew just who I was
Somewhere around your second lifetime
We danced on Persian rugs
We fucked and fell in love tonight


It's who we are
Too familiar, solar
Energy carried on and on and on
Ripples in the pond
Like a mirror, solar
Energy carried on and on and


Hey, I think I luh you 
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do
I think I luh you 
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do


Few shots, then we rid them off
Goofed off in the loft
With the Scope on I can kill them all
We can be lovers two souls in a different life
But you know we done here been here before
How did you know we only sip clear liquor
Smoke purple endo, top floor level
Type of shit that get
Flown across the pond


I think I love you, ooooh
We must have been together
It's something like I thought it was
And what a lasting impression
You left me with an open door
I want it more and more


It's who we are
Too familiar, solar
Energy carried on and on and on
Ripples in the pond
Like a mirror, solar

Do you believe that we are star crossed
Forgive me if I'm wrong
Forgive me if I'm wrong, spinning off

"I think I'll take my foolish heart, my friend, and head right for the door
There'll be a better world waitin' if I do
'Cause I know I've been down this road a time or two before
The only time I let my heart turn to you

Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door

Still somethin' deep inside keeps tellin' me to make the sacrifice
And askin' me to walk the extra mile
I've walked it now to many times with freedom for the price
Too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles

Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door

I know I must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight
And leave the moon up above to hold your gaze
It's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride
Maybe some day I'll see the sunshine upon your face

Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door

I'll take my heart, and head right for the door...

I used to live in the darkness
Dress in black, act so heartless
But now I see that colors are everything
Got kaleidoscopes in my hairdo
Got back the stars in my eyes, too
Yeah, now I see the magic inside of me


Yeah, maybe my head's fucked up
But I'm falling right back in love with being alive
Dreaming in light, light, lights
This kitty cat lost her mind
Been lookin' for a star-sent sign that I'll be alright
Look to the skies


I’ve found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know, life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight


I'd forgot how to daydream
So consumed with the wrong things
But in the dark, I realized this life is short
And deep down, I'm still a child
Playful eyes, wide and wild
I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold


And I know that I'm still fucked up
But aren't we all, my love?
Darling, our scars make us who we are, are
So when the winds are howling strong
And you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart


You'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Night, night, night, night, night

You like snow but only if it's warm
You like rain but only if it's dry


There's no sentimental value to the rose
That fell on your floor
No fundamental excuse
For the granted I'm taken for


Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around
Never comes around to you
To you


You like pain but only if it doesn't hurt too much
And you sit, and you wait, to receive


There's an obvious attraction
To the path of least resistance, in your life
There's an obvious aversion
No amount of my insistence could make you try tonight


Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around
Never comes around to you
To you, to you
To you, to you

There's no love
No money
No thrill anymore


There's an apprehensive naked little trembling boy
With his head in his hands
And there's an underestimated and impatient little girl
Raising her hand

So much easier not to
And what goes around never comes around to you

Oh, the last time I saw you
You looked so good, baby
There was moonlight everywhere
Oh and God only knows How I hated to leave you standing there
You know I told you that I wanted to hold you
But the moment was not right
So I took off down the road for another lonely night


Oh, I wanna spend my life with you
Baby, tell me is that so wrong
I don't ever want to say good night to you
I wanna hold you all night long

And I'm ready to give in
'Cause I may never find anybody like you again
You see nobody's ever made me want to
Do what I'm 'bout to do
Because I found everything
And it's all wrapped up in you


Oh, I wanna spend my life with you

To find somebody who's heart's not taken
And I believe you're the one
Oh no, I don't mean at all to upset you
Honey, I knew from the moment I met you
If I could find a way to get you
I'd have to fall in love

Swerving on the 405, I can never keep my eyes off this
My neck, the feeling of your soft lips
Illuminated in the light, bouncing off the exit signs I missed


All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride
All we do is drive

And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing

Umm.. Hey, I was just wondering if you wanna like… never mind. Thank you. Bye...


Your laugh echoes down the highway
Carves into my hollow chest, spreads over the emptiness
It's bliss
It's so simple but we can't stay
Over analyze again, would it really kill you if we kissed?

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize your beauty


It was a Saturday, this cold afternoon
Inside this house there lived a frightened young girl
She didn't know what she should do
'Cause she missed her mother so
She was left home all alone with her stepfather


Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay

He touched her places that he shouldn't have touched
He did some things to her that he shouldn't have done
So she ran into her room, paged her mother, 9-1-1
And the tragedy began for this young girl
She told her mother, her family and friends
No one believed her, 'cause before this happened
She was filled with hate and anger towards her step father
Cause he took her mother from her when they married


Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize your beauty


She looked for her father in the men that she saw
Thought that all she had to offer was her body
No one to figure out why this young girl would live her life
In such pain and unhappiness, she was so beautiful
She rebelled and one day the young girl fell in love
With another man like her stepdad
He abused her emotionally and made her feel like she was worthless
Hope one day she realize and see the beauty in her eyes
All she needs is prayer and strength
She's beautiful


Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay

Don't hold your head down low

So much, so much, so much to be proud of
You can still live your life
I promise you, you'll survive

Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who sang a sort of Indian Hideho
To the people passing by

The pinto spent his time a swichin' flies
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
On the people passing by

One day they went a walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not lookin'
Toot toot
They never came back

Across the alley from the Alamo
When the summer sun decides to settle low
A fly sings an indian Hideho
To the people passing by

Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough
To the people passing by

They thought that they would make some easy bucks
If they're washin' their frijoles in Duz and Lux
A pair of very conscientious clucks
On the people passing by

The they took this cheap vacation
Their shoes were polished bright
No they never heard the whistle
Toot toot
They're clear out of sight

Across the alley from the Alamo
When the starlight beams its tender tender glow
The beams go to sleep and there ain't no dough
For the people passing by

Stared down in the valley at a Christmas memory
Saw a young boy in a cabin hang a stockin' on a peg
Peace on Earth was ours down in the valley

Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire a-blazin', all the family's gathered 'round
There was nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground

Mama still plays carols on those worn out ivory keys
And Papa's hooked his old team up to fetch the Christmas tree
I watch my boy climb on a limb, shakin' loose the mistletoe
Just the way I did not so long ago

Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smilin' through your frown
I'm askin' baby boo are you down
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation, Mr. I-get-around
My temptation got me drippin' wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you're makin'
Baby why you fakin'? Strip naked get to love makin'
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize 'til that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'
A straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'
Stop with the beeper, baby, listen
I know you're grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find

Just like a little kid, still believin' in magic

With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby, you're movin' to fast
My conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug?
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub?
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alizé, come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
And I know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time

Hea-ven!!
Heaven ain't hard to find
Hea-ven!!, it ain't hard to find


You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talkin' since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back
Lookin' mean, what's all that?
It's like the closer you get
Baby, the quicker I'm speakin'
I got a flight out to Cabo
Let's kick it this weekend
I'm sippin' Hennessy and Coke
Though addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh God, help me, identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion
Who would have thought?
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends, I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind, baby

From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away

Did you ever hear of a clown with tear drops streaming down his face?

Deranged from the blood stains all over my brain
Just another day, this killer train is ridin' down your way
I'm fucking starting to unthread, these voices that's in my head
I got a romance with the dead, and sleeping in river beds, uh
Damaging my organs, to me, they just ain't important
I'm a different kind of breed, the one that don't even breathe
The one you ain't gotta feed, just rob and take what I need
Fucking product of the $uicide, fucking spawn of Satan
Cuttin' on my wrist, while these women fornicating
I'm debating to take my life, forsaken by sacrifice
Mistaken for something nice


Pile of ashes is my final form
Got a roll of duct tape, and a rag soaked in chloroform
Flies swarm because my body's warm, shatter the urn
See me blowing in the wind like a scattered storm
Grey matter splattered in front of the corner store
Saw that when I was fourteen, walking around the 2nd Ward
Send him to the seventh floor
Ended up with floor seats to something I didn't want to see
Now that scene is in my head every time I go to sleep
When I dream, I rest in peace knowing I'll be dead
Earth will be my final bed
Poison me with lead, inject it into my fucking head


Pressure, pressure
How do I dear deal with all this pressure?
In my way
It’s in my lungs
It’s in my thoughts
It’s in my brain
A guilty conscience some might say, I’m paranoid and locked away
A withering weed in the garden that God wasn't supposed to save
Locked up in an open grave
Reading King James' Bible
With a couple quotes erased, but kept the ones that made me smile
Do I really see everything for what it is?
Or is it that I can’t see anything with such a bad case of denial
When I die, then put my body in a boat
And light it on fire, push me out to sea
And let the wind do what I might-a
No matter whatever I feel about anything
It wasn’t until I burned all my bridges
It made my future brighter

Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go, drenched my pullover

And feel something other than relieved
Glad that I left when I did before
I know you, you can't get the best of me


When I'd speak of artistry you would roll your eyes skyward
When I'd speak of spirituality you would label it absurd
When I spoke of possibility you would frown and shake your head

The masked struggle that I'm in, the same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further the way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me

A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me

And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club

Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones

But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?

For a house full of neds who are wanting us dead
In Glasgow and Leeds we find signs of relief
An escape from our grief with a fistful of E's
Eight day hell
You're in an eight day hell

Every man needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Every man needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you


John the Baptist took Jesus Christ
Down to the river on a Friday night
They talked about Mary like a couple of boys
With nothing to lose
Too scared to try


Every man needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Every man needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you


Joseph Campbell and The Rolling Stones
Couldn't give me a myth
So I had to write my own
I got hung up on religion
Though I know it's a waste
I never liked the name ""Joshua""
And I got tired of ""J.""

Boy oh, boy
I love it when I fall for that

I should be in bed 
Temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come

One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me

And ""no thank you""

Do I even got a pulse?
Am I empty? 'Cause I gave my love away
It doesn't seem like you willin' to try
I think we're running out of time now
And I can hear the sirens
And all the caution tape wrapped around my body
Would you rather be happy with another?
Or maybe it's you that's undercover


I never thought that you would change my life
I wouldn't have left if I had known the price
Tell me what am I waiting for?
Electric shock won't help no more
Surgery before I fall apart
Get the jumper cables from my car
Baby, I need you to bring me back
Will you bring me back?


'Cause I'm trying not to think at all
I'm slipping, there's no one to catch my fall
And I need you here 'cause you're the air I breathe
And you're the only one for me, baby, you're my oxygen
So please let me breathe again or I'ma flatline


I don't know why you won't help me
And I know we argue and we disagree
But the scent of your body, memories of our life
You decide to neglect when the truth is that...

All of this and more of nothing in my life
No color clay
Individuality not safe

So unsure you run from something strong

Threadbare tapestry unwinding slow
Feel a tortured brain
Show your belly like you want me to

So unsure, we reach for something strong

Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love

Red wine time on the couch
Happy you agreed to hang out
Keep my head in the clouds
Keep them old names out your mouth
I can make you laugh out loud
We the only ones in the house
I can help you body wind down
Make this bottle disappear right now
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Let's stay in for the night
Maybe take a walk outside
Let's distance your pride
Me fall in love with your mind
If I look deep in your eyes
I can guess your zodiac sign
We ain't got nothing but time
We can just chill and unwind
Get comfortable, comfortable

I was sent like a penny in a loafer
The 2Pac Deepak Chopra
On a plane drinking wine with Oprah
When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her
Black Caesar, ey o amo roma
Tuto biene vino rosa
My dominican girl she loves soca
Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA
Most of my friends at home that I'm close to
When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture
Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper
Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound
I'm bound to the underground
Breaking walls down for the black and brown
A activist is active now
How far will you go for exposure?
Little homie in the paint tryna post up
Don't make me have to put you on a poster
Posterized by what I vocalize
Weathered the storm like I know the skies
Yea we wear the mask but I know no disguise
These signs of the times are notarized
Written by the lord of the skies mortalized
In us, I got cold through cruel winters
Grandmas, defenders, Fred Hamptons agenda
Never been good with pretenders
They lying on the king like Simba
Dinner, branzino and red wine
Quality shared time
Fucking and laughing 'til its bed time


Red like my lips
Blue like past thoughts
Brown like your eyes
Just enough time
I can't think now
You're too close and I…
Might be too nice
These New York nights
Got me taking chances
I think your hands
Might look just right
If they held mine
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get two glasses
Now I'm swimming
Off the deep end
Heightened senses
No pretending
Make my head spin
I like dancing
In my bedroom
It's just me and you
Put that tape on
Tell me what you want
Let's just make time feel, long
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You could just stay for the night
Here, let me turn down the lights
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You can let go
Passion comes from down below
We go together like so
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Let's make a toast
That we both can make the most of this time

Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?


Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?


He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind


Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl


Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can

Ga ga G-Unit!  haha, yo, yo

I need no introduction, everybody 
Heard of 50 Cent, and heard of G-Unit
I'm not Hi-Tek and I'm not Kweli  - you see me in the club
You better tell the bouncers to treat me special, I'm somebody 
Cause I get on that jet, in 5 minutes flat
Niggas'll come back, shoot up your party 
If I don't have fun, nobody havin' none
I'm tryin' to holla at ya, come here shorty 
Shout out to my nigga Juvie, Wacko's here
Buck, my niggas from New Orleans, wodie 
If we on the same page, when you see me on stage
You gonna throw your hands up, and you gonna applaud me 
You know how I get, I'm still on that bullshit, nigga, nigga


I run around with the trey  pound like its a sport
And call my name in the bench, while I sit in court
I got a million dollar smile , and a fist full of pesos
And the wrist so icey, it could light up a stage show
In the club , nigga I stay holdin'
Cause I'm on point for them wolves, and sheep clothin'
I play the bar , with a double shot of Henny
Cause after this spot, its cheaters, and envy
 


Yeah, Banks, yeah
Look you ain't got to like me, that's  cool, I don't give a fuck
Clowny time ain't gonna put me in a bigger truck
Fuck kids, it  ain't my turn to be stressed
A bitch worse nightmare is a paternity test
I'm too young to be faithful 
If money means love, I hate you
I only trick on the first of April
Holla at me, if you thugged  out shorty ready to fight you
Dice, roll a blunt, and pull the snub out for me
And if your not don't even  call me

Won't you please clap your hands?
Please, say amen
'Cause love is so high, you can't get over
You're lucky to find a holy clover
Give it a try, you can't get 'round it
You'll reach the sky, you're only grounded

And feel our love then come to us

Don't know it all, just trying to school ya
This common love, you won't get by now
But this kind of love you'll find in the sky
We can feel it up
And feel our love encounters love is real
Say something
Don't sit down say nothing, no

Makes you clap your hands, son

Something to say this evening
I gotta have
Something to say this evening
I'd say one Sunday evening
Somebody came knocking at my door
Knocking at my door, open the door and let him in
Was a feeling, oh, oh, feeling, hey
Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me lost, ah, just a squeeze
Oh, mug around the house
Talking about going someplace
One thing about it I never heard mama
Talk about going to Chicago too much
I might even go into New York city
But never had an idea
That I wanna go to heaven
And I wanna go to heaven
I wanna go, I feel pretty good
I wanna go to 
I feel pretty good, yeah
I feel like, I feel like I wanna, huh

Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby
Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I don’t do what I do, then who’s gon put food on the table?
It is what it is, I’m just handling biz
But I do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live


Mama don’t work, heater don’t work
Police pulled me over and said he seen weed on my shirt
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin’ it
I said “I rolled one up, I won’t insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago”
He asked me when the last time I smoke, I said a while ago
Forgive me officer, I’m stressin’ and my pockets sore
Hurtin’, chillin’ with my dog like a fuckin’ Labrador
He said he ain’t with the bull: matador
Looked at the top of my car, like what this ladder for?
I told him I was puttin’ goals up in the mornin’
And I’m goin’ to my uncle’s house to see if he can join me
The officer got a call so he was needed
And he told me slow it down, and I told him please believe it
Then I proceeded to go to my uncle’s house
Well it really wasn’t my uncle, it was a junkie’s house
He got a badass niece with a donkey now
Pullin’ out the parking lot, headed to the other spot
Out all night, at it with the addicts, causin’ Havoc, I’m a Prodigy
Niggas know we Mobbin’ Deep, gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep
The good die young, and promises are hard to keep
I left my old job, and now them niggas hardly speak
I got a new job, and plus I’m making more a week
The girl that I’m with is like a young Kimora Lee
I got them folks feenin’, pumpin’ that Jodeci
Sippin’ and my soda pink, you niggas is toilet seat
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys
Conduct disorderly, stayin’ in the trap house
Trips went to work, I’m so glad that it mapped out


Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby
Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I don’t do what I do, then who’s gon put food on the table?

Kept working my dun dun duns, come get your mama some
Nigga, this that slum talk, some say we talks slums
I rarely finish the end of my words
Watch the rims hit on the curve
And what a nigga really care about a lisp?
People arguin’ over me while I’m layin’ in a bitch
Death to a snitch, get it while you can  and shit
Its 3:30 in the A.M
We’re just gettin’ started like when I had the van
Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass
Your style good enough to put in a Glad bag
You know I’m gettin’ mines, you should use a hashtag
Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses
Just killed the pussy, you gon’ have to use forensics
Organized crime, you could put me in a lineup
Plus I got dreads, I’ll pay a hundred for the line up


Appetite for destruction, and I don’t need a menu
So far ahead of y’all niggas, I can see you in my rearview
See you in my rearview, one of your headlights out nigga
I just got my first R&B bitch and got head all night with her
She said she tired of the generic
I say what up, she say what up, what up, you a parrot?
I’m like “Bird ass girl, aren’t you sick of the rhetoric?”
And, if I ain’t arrogant, I’m out of my element, ugh

Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me

Everytime I come around they call the police on me

Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin
Quick to make examples out of niggas fo' sho' man, hold me down




Shoot, stab, kill muh'fucker

Them hollows so hot, yo' ass'll melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt - I'll give you a shape up
Have your ass stitched, gored, your head all taped up
Niggas know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Ha ha, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down - and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise cause niggas know how we get down
Black tints on the Testarossa, hammer out the holster
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that Gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back, start killin shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined, plus we militant




Two windows to a man's soul
... fill you with holes
Listen homey.. I'm the man for the job
So if he ain't.. 


I'm in that two-door Phantom and the body's kitted
Waves in my head lookin like tsunami hit it
Niggas scheme, but the infrared beam's on the mack
I'll put green on yo' head like an Oakland A's hat
One boy was a doja, now he a soldier
My little son Dula lettin off the Ruger
In a whip masked up, lookin for his enemies
Ridin gassed up, off double D batteries
His last casualties, is hooked to them IV's
 that's when I squeeze 
Click-clack, take that, fall back
It's a contract, 50 grand, I'm 50 man




Yeah! This is the general speakin

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


There's such a difference between us
And a million miles


Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?


It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time


So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore



Ooh, anymore

Ooh, anymore

Ooh, anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Make me feel like I'm, the only man alive for you

Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away


Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own


There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day


Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own


Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own


Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings

They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK

Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft

Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, ""Fuck it, let the music be his""
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?

Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6"" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, ""Fuck the world"" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight

If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop

'Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till


Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
They said they had a reason, but I can't remember what
They tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street


Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie
Was just for the fun of killing' him and to watch him slowly die


And then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind


I saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see
The smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea


If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow
For you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!


This song's just a reminder to remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give
We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live

Volevi che io ti guardassi
E io ti guardavo li sull'insalata

Ooh...


She still remembers a time that was uncomplicated
But sure as the sun rise she's seen things that you'll never see
Losses and heartache amount to her strength
But oh, how they both take their toll


She's still here fighting
Better know there's life in her yet


Time will take us all, and turn us into stones
It leaves us with regrets and picks apart the threads
Hung over fragile bones


Let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go


Her hands tell the story of hardships that we'll never know
Her face is a map of a lifetime on well traveled roads
But those eyes tell nothing of a soul that is spared
A heart that is longing for death


She's still here fighting
Better know there's life in her yet


Time will take us all, and turn us into stones
It leaves us with regret, it picks apart the threads
Hung over fragile bones

Bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb

Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails; you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue

Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor

It’s a dirty job but somebody’s gotta do it
I see you working go and put your back into it
Baby I’mma watch… you, just keep it moving
You know exactly what you’re doing
So go and do your dirty work
Go and do your dirty work


Ass up
Face down
Perfect body and she lay it to the ground
Stacked up
Waist down
Wanted to throw it like a pitcher on a mound
I see them niggas reaching for their last dollar
Asking dumb questions like “baby, do you model?”
Promising everything, hopin’ that they follow
Praying for America, I hope they down with Harry Potter
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?




Gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down...
Go and do your dirty work
Gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down...


Back up
Shake down
Just give it all to me and do it right now
Shack up
Take down
Just wanna love you without looking' like a clown
You’re the best that ever did it
You’re killing everybody, how're you supposed to make a living?
Yes I know you hear it all when they trickin'
I can hear them niggas saying you too pretty to be strippin'
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?






More money, more problems, less rest
If it’s about a dollar later, shorty, let’s invest
Drop the top, pull the whip out like a hamstring
You on your job but I’m a boss, I keep my hands clean
Keep grabbin' all up on my coat
I’m lettin' out all of this smoke
I’m thrown' money in the air
I’m buying' bottles for my folks
And then I’m coming back for more
‘Cause you know all my favorite features

From the day rise up
Until the night falls down

You called me perfect

You tried to mold me
And I thought that I would please you more


You want me to be what you want me to be
But you can't paint me over

I tried my best to be your everything
But you can't
Paint me over

I close my eyes and memorize the girl that I was
Before there was us
Hard to remember
It's been so long since she's been around
I gave up myself
And still I let you down






I must have fought for your heart
If it was mine from the start
Your love's conditional
Mine

I let you have for free
You had a price to your love
And gladly I gave it up
And now there's nothing left
Because I let you change all of me

Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow

And raised a redhead son

And prayed the rain would come

That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations

Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married

Every rock that goes around

Where I know they'll lay me down

The rains just seem to flood

Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon


I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you


We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save them we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
“You need to let go, you got no control""
No


I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you


This weight’s too much alone
Some days I can’t hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you
Yea when tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you

Nothing ever stops all these thoughts
And the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
It's like nothing I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words, I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize, instead of setting it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me


It never goes away

And now, you've become a part of me

You've become a part of me

I can't separate

Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you


Hearing your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I'd see you in every thought I had, and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing myself to them, and everyday
I regret saying those things, 'cause now
I see that I took what I hated and made it a part of me

Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling’ up, we struggle and we scrape
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape


City’s just a jungle; more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, trying' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working’ in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down


Got nothing' for you, I had nothing' before
Don’t even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, pain pouring’ down
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around


All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long


Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking’ 'bout the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping' in Rosie’s bed


Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too


Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
I need something strong to distract my mind
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind


Well I got here following' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long


Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinking' fast
I’m drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
I’ve got nothing but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me


Everybody moving if they ain’t already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting' right about now


My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting’ to be kind
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine


Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him? 
Or would you start switchin upv
You thinkin 'bout the penitentiary and bitchin up?
What if he said money ain't everything, the hood raised us wrong
All jux'll get your money long but look here I'm gone
Would that touch your heart? Have you feelin funny inside?
Would that be enough to make your punk-ass ride?
What if he gave you a little list of things to do?
Said he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you
Would you load the gats, and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at yo' crib and hide?
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength, now you in a daze
Your homey turnin over in his grave... cause you PUSSY!

You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven

You gon' try and tell God you've been framed?

Now you Uptown coppin, and he in the morgue

But they ain't come inside, they sat out in the ride
At the funeral, homicide all in the buisness

Get up in the jam you know who to call to bail out
Got a bad bitch, know these niggas gon' hate
Can't stop getting money bitch I don't got brakes
If a nigga bout his bread, it be getting to his head
He be running from the feds, left a lot of niggas dead
Ain't enough kush, he be rolling like dice
Show him who the business now he wanna throw the rights
He'll pay for it if I gave him a price, fuck around with my type boy you know you ain't right
I'm knowing your bitch ain't had shit
Its Dreezy and 21 Savage
Yeah million dollar nigga blow the money like a whistle
Take me where I wanna order steak up off the menu
Hard head nigga, know he gripping on a pistol, if you buy me a ring we can make this shit official
Fucking with me harder than your niggas, power couple yeah we all up on a mission
I know when you gotta handle business, you know imma be here waiting for you when you finish
Let's get it


She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle
Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it
All my garments come from France, French kissing in France
Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it

"Well i tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Giving that woman just a one more chance
To give it to me one more time
Engineer wishing he was home in bed
Dreaming about casey jones
Wide-eyed woman heading a mile ahead 
Thinking about broken bones

It's her love that i want
It's her love that i need
It's her love got to have
It's her love

Heavenly body flying across the sky
Superman was out of town
Come on honey, gotta change your tune
Cause it's a long way down
Clark kent looking for a free ride
Thinking about lois lane
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's - a suicide
And that'd be a shame

It's her love that i want
It's her love that i need
It's her love got to have
It's her love

But what's next to the moon?

Long arm looking for a fingerprint
Trying to find the mystery clue
Hitting me with the third degree
Working on a thumb screw
Alright, officer, i confess
Everything's coming back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack

It's her love that i want
It's her love that i need
It's her love got to have
It's her love

What's next to the moon?

Same color your Air Force Ones
White on white, ya like?
Red I Flight the night
From L.A. to N.Y
I'm Harlem bound
You see how bitches tense up, when Scarlett 'round
Niggas get the heart to holla while we up in the club
But get intimidated when they see me sitting on dubs
I hear 'em whispering "" dat ain't a man, shit that's her.""
She roll with them G Unit niggas, that's what's up
Disrespect me, I'll have niggas blast ya up
Take my advice, don't let ya peoples grass ya up
I got a fetish for the chips
20's for the six
Hollows for the clips
Try me, if you think I'm playing bitch
And the police we'll have another crime scene taker
Jim Star crush your head, give your ass a shape-up

Everybody ain't shook, you see doing the shake

With the 9 and the velour
A cal in my pocket

My road dog, under the jail
Getting frustrating mail
So I'm drinking and smoking
Thinking and hoping
This cell gon' open
You can dance next to me, but don't throw an elbow
I'll throw one back and leave blood on your Shell Toes
Hell no
I ain't paying for pleasure
Your pussy don't bring rainbows and pots of treasure
It's every girl's dream, to floss with the team
Long on the suine
DVD's on the screen
Blowing on cream
Waiting for you to scheme
You ain't gotta know how to read, to spray a magazine

Ya'll irritate me, like loud people in the movies
Fall back, matter fact back down
Cause I just passed security without no pat down
You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky
Or catch me on the dancefloor feeling some tits
Sex sells, so I'mma P-I-M-P

And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again

There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching

And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats

Ready to roll, what's patience?
This is the show, fake it or make it
Risk it all to win
Racing for the rush again
Ready, set, begin
Ride or die, we fall or fly


Catch me I'm drifting behind
Racing the tempest inside
Shifting into overdrive
Ready my spirit to ride
Ready my spirit to ride
Ready my spirit to ride


Burning out
Colliding
Caught in a storm cloud
I need a way out
I'm running out
Of lightning
Nowhere to turn now
Into the breakdown


Uh you took a fall, now you're frustrated
You got it all, but you can't take it
You hit a wall, so jaded
Who is the God that you've been chasing?
Lost the rush again
Racing for adrenaline
Ready, set, begin
Riding high, we fall or fly


Catch me I'm drifting behind
Racing the tempest inside
Shifting into overdrive
Ready my spirit to ride


Burning out
Colliding
Caught in a storm cloud
I need a way out
I'm running out
Of lightning
Nowhere to turn now
Into the breakdown


Feel the rush of burning light 
Naked feet and holy fire 
Pieces of my mess unwind 
Heaven hold me in the vine 
Bending colors in my eyes 
Tears of glory mending time 


Take my life and let it be, for my King, for my King
Take my moments and my days, ceaseless praise, ceaseless praise
Take my heart it is your own royal throne, royal throne
Take my voice and let me sing, for my King, for my King
Take my heart and steal my gaze, ceaseless praise, ceaseless praise
Take my hands and let them move, for Your love, for Your love...

Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes


A cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes


They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes


Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes

"I used to be your favorite drunk
Good for one more laugh
Then we both ran out of luck
Luck was all we ever had
You put on a uniform
To fight the Civil War
You looked so good I didn't care
What side you're fighting for

Wasn't all that easy
When you up and walked away
But I'll save that little story
For another rainy day
I know the burden's heavy
As you will it through the night
Some people say it's empty
But that don't mean it's light

You left me with the dishes
And a baby in the bath
You’re tight with the militias
You wear their camouflage
You always said we're equal
So let me march with you
Just an extra in the sequel
To the old red-white-and-blue

Baby don't ignore me
We were smokers, we were friends
Forget that tired story
Of betrayal and revenge
I see the ghost of culture
With numbers on his wrist
Salutes some new conclusion
That all of us have missed

I cried for you this morning
And I’ll cry for you again
But I’m not in charge of sorrow
So please don’t ask me when
There may be wine and roses
And magnums of champagne
But we'll never
No we'll never ever be that drunk again

Okay


The party's over
But I've landed on my feet
And I'm standing here on this corner
Where there used to be a street
The party's over
But I've landed on my feet
I’ll be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street

So let’s drink to when it’s over
And let’s drink to when we meet
I’ll be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street

Beneath my very soul

Just trippin’ and laughin’ at the crap
Dap is what i get the best skins that i hit
You know we rock the fuckin’ joint and we split
Singin’ and rhymin’s what i’m better for
When i describe i’m a scribe with a metaphor
I use a simile lightly ‘cuz that shits played
The common way most rhymes are made, ya know
I rock like this i flow like that
But all those comparisons are just that
Kickin’ different styles i’ll be right here
Today, tomorrow, next week and next year
I always say what i feel and that is a promise
Nothing in life is above being honest
Sauna is cool compared to being on stage
But that’s how it’s gotta go in the stone age

The fame in my game i name rapture
Like a polished rock i’ll make it shine for sure
Word is that i’ve travelled become unraveled
I been around the world baby gimme an apple
I’ll be your boogie man rather than son-of-sam
What i am is what i am
Though we don’t have too long to love a day a night
We only love those who love us right back

The kid is smart the kid is clever
Stompin’ in jack-o-lantern’s weather
Backpack strapped ‘cuz the world is cold
Headphones pumpin’ don’t ya know
The kid is smart the kid is clever
Stompin’ in jack-o-latern’s weather
Rocks his hood and plays it mellow
While maple leaves change into yellow

And oh shit damn honey at it again
Tryin’ to beat my high score since the age of ten
See my high score flash on the back glass
I was malcontented doug in gifted class
Now heres the deal we came to heal we gonna rock in rio
Oh no it’s not a joke it’s how we feel
Put to test like a sugar ray scientist
I’m always dancing in my sunday best
I’m betting on my bliss and my path is lit’ see
The microphone is live and i’m rockin’ my body
Smooth like reggie miller in an airborne freeze frame
Funky like the kung-fu that can put you to shame

I’m like hey wait a minute
Give a check one two then i’m ready to begin it
With a boom boom bap coming outta your trunkies
Give a fat shout out to the phunk junkeez
Stricken like a cancer taken chances
But i love to see the girl windin’ like the belly dancer
Standin’ up front with a tight stomach showin
Me on stage singin, flowin
We just kickin’ it live we just kickin’ it live

Give me what I'm asking for
Stop bringing me down or I'll slam the door
You're getting out of line with the Beverly Boys
You start making the moves
They start making the noise
You know you're not getting lucky living the life
Because you're moving to the jungle and paying the price
You're living right along with the
New Brady Bunch
Have your people call my people and let's do lunch
Reaction to the actin there's more to me than human flesh
I've had enough distractions I need some tenderness


Human touch
I got to know it's real
I'm tired of people selling their sex appeal
Human Touch
I need human love
No imitations of oh baby


A bird in the busy is worth two in the street
You know the kind of people never want to meet
You're sitting really pretty in your swimming pool
With your rock and roll tan
You keep thinking you're cool
You know you can't reach Jesus on your portable phone
He ain't speaking to the people in their Hollywood homes
With a toot in your snoot and your loot to boot
You don't even give a hoot about the minds you pollute
Looking for deceptions
There's more to me than human flesh
I'm finding new directions
I need some tenderness!


Human touch
I got to know it's real
I'm tired of people selling their sex appeal

I'm going to stop at nothing

Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie
Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride
Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe
Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity, they parted our families
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross 
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering
400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to 26's after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the 400 years we never saw
The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss
Slaves


I said the 400 years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got 4,5,6 rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an 02' Monte Carlo with 24's on it
And on the back of the window it says, ""Get on my level ho""
You're a vanity slave

We're all vanity slaves, and with that being said
Can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here, hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month, checks coming in
I'm tryna get some
What up?

Holding the course through long nights and days
The ice and the hail bear no malice

Bite deep on the oars
Scouring the spray on the storm’s maul
Then lightning reveals for what we all pray
By Odin in Asgard its land fall
Life from death, combat rests
Heralds peace for the slain

Takes us there
On an unrelenting tide
As the wind drives us ashore

There is a voice I can't deny


I break with the past
Set the nexus free at last
As the future will be there to save us
Trapped in my skin
See the nexus in my dreams
But will you bury me within


Yeah, I rise so you can be a part of me
I hide as part of the machinery

I've stepped on the wires
Feeding the flames to burn higher-er


And as the darkness reveals
I see no reason
For me to reach for the cure
I'm my own demon


I kept the secrets in my mind
There is a voice I can't deny


I break with the past
Set the nexus free at last
As the future will be there to save us
Trapped in my skin
See the nexus in my dreams
But will you bury me within


Face it down
I'm the spine in the flame
Just let it out of me
Break it out of the core
To help me breath


I have the will inside my mind
There is a voice I can't deny


I break with the past
Set the nexus free at last
As the future will be there to save us
Trapped in my skin
See the nexus in my dreams
But will you bury me within

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles
Passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryin' to keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
Finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful


Wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
Find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical


And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room


Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

I told my mother
'Take me to the bay and put me on a ship'

Silver swordfish

If the water should cut my life
If the water should cut my mind, set me free
I don't care
I want to live in a bathysphere

'But you can't swim'
And I never dreamed of the sea again

Well, the neon lights burned red and gold
I came to have my fortune told
Can't imagine what she saw
While gazing in her crystal ball


Far out past the astral plane
I cast you back from whence you came
Cosmic ash and blackened brain
I call you by your ancient names


I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her


What the fortune teller said is
I'm alive for now but good as dead
She claims she'd seen it all
While she was gazing in her crystal ball


If I can't evade my fate
Then I won't sit around and wait
A fallen star will be thy bane

"She was a flower for the takin'
Her beauty cut just like a knife
He was a banker from Macon
Swore he'd love her all his life

Bought her a mansion on a mountain
With a formal garden and a lot a land

But paradise became her prison
That Georgia banker was a jealous man


Every time he'd talk about her
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say
I would walk through Hell on Sunday
To keep my Rose in Paradise

He hired a man to tend the garden
Keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say that gardener left alone

Now the banker is an old man
That mansion's crum-ble-ing down
He sits all day and stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found


Every time he talks about her
You can see the fire in his eyes
He'd say, ""I would walk through Hell on Sunday
To keep my Rose in Paradise

Now there's a rose out in the garden
Its beauty cuts just like a knife
They say that it even grows in the winter time
And blooms in the dead of the night

Of our pretty little heads these days

I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth
But I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe

And the stars seem to change
Far beyond our universe tonight

And the cries of the brave
And the skies filled with pain
For the silent ones we pray for all tonight

New dawn rising
Destruction and pain
Long days passing
The fear of the rain

Soldiers fighting on
The price they will pay
Nuclear meltdown
The world uncertain

For the power of the tragedy of man's creation
Rise from the suffering for our salvation
Fearless we stand
Strong 'til the end
At the trial of all our lives
Now say your final goodbyes

Light the path for the journey home
Save a prayer for the lost alone
Find a way from the other side
Before the hero stands, still blinding
Through the long nights across the seas
Shine a light for eternity
Find a way beyond the other side
Until the last man stands for all mankind

Skies now blackened
The night turns to day
Nations fearful of global decay
Fires still raging on
In vain now we pray
Nuclear fire
The fortunes fading

As we stand at the edge of barren desolation
Fight for the future of our generation
Fearless we stand
Brave we defend
For a thousand years gone by
Now say our final goodbyes

Light the path for the journey home
Save a prayer for the lost alone
Find a way from the other side
Before the hero stands, still blinding
Through the long nights across the seas
Shine a light for eternity

I did this track for the Church
Everybody talking about they living it dawg
But we need to see it


Aye I'm not ashamed this 116
My crew cliqued up 40 deep with this
Repentant sinners who were called and cleansed
Through the blood-stained banner my recompence
Out of love for my Lord Who I represent
From the island of Samoa to the blocks and the bricks
To the dudes in the gang with the rocks on their wrists
With the Glocks on their hip while they popping their clips
But dawg it's the people dying for lack of this information
I pray that everybody would flock to the Rock of Ages
Especially when they find out we serve a God that's so gracious
But ain't nobody talking to brother when sin-complacent
Born in sin we all is dawg, like Adam we falling dawg
Yet and still He's callin' dawg, and sometimes we be stalling dawg
You run like an athlete, in a track meet and the packed heat
When it's packed deep like a back seat
You can catch me, like a taxi, on the back street
When the fact be, I'm a black sheep
But God chooses to save us mayne, pull us out and rep His name
Plus through Jesus He pleases to use us as His vessels mayne
Cats who wanna walk it and talk it, teach it and preach it
They love it, they live it, they'll go to wherever to reach em


We kingdom people
We're willing to repent and cats that will rep the Lord
Bondservants for His service who live to expect the Lord
We live to bless the Lord cause we confess the Lord
Truthfully all we ever needed was just the Lord


In the midst of this disaster bruh
He's calling for ambassadors
To hit the strip with a clique
Spit truth on how He didn't pass the cup
But how He took the wrath for us
And out of love He asked for us
But we ignore and pass Him up
For the life of the night that's blasphemous
Despite the fact sin's hazardous
Somehow it keeps on grabbing us
Attracting us, dig tracks in us
And before we know it, it masters us
Man how does this happen huh?
We never do plan on acting up
But could it you lacking love
For the Lord ..
We're in a war like Maximus
And discipline builds your character
The typical way we should live life
So men see Christ when they stare at ya
No hocus pocus, magic wands
No one cares you're the pastor's son
Persevere through trials of this life
That's how we improve, pass it on
There's no time to be complacent
Let hope be your motivation
That's enough to spark a movement
Even in incarceration
On campus or in the hood
Stop limping off in the cut
Learn the word and spit it bruh
Man it's time we step it up


Aye first thing first dawg Jesus lives
Heaven dawg you bet it's real
Rep Him till we dead and still
Or at least until the next appeal
This is for my people in the church chilling
All my kingdom people stand up
Man its time we hold it down and live it
Come on dawg cause we Christians
Man there's a war and we missing
We're living slack on our mission
And if you knew your position
Dawg you'd be out representing
Holding your Bible and tract
Yelling revival is back
On the block, in the hood, boondocks
In the woods, in truth, not idiling back
Jesus He died for us dawg
Come on we gotta trust God
Peter was bold in the Spirit
And watched 3000 trust God
And that same Spirit we got Him
Let's put the cross on the move
They should see more than our building
Let's get up out of the pews
Hope this is God in your view
God's with us, Emmanuel
If you with us, rep Him well
And if you not, time will tell
Dawg I don't play with no fraud
Dawg I don't play cause it's hard
Rep His love, rep His grace
Shake this place now for the Lord

"Good morning ladies and gentleman
And welcome to today's seminar entitled Conspiracy Theory
Where the focus will be conspiracy itself
And today's special guest speaker is legendary lyricist AZ
Ever since society's inception there has been a hierarchy where in which you have
The inclusive and the exclusive
And today he will be expounding on the two entities
Of the included and those of us who are excluded

Sky high gas prices another housing unit being built right in Rikers they opportunists
Society don't like us we like mutants
What happened to the dark cyphers the loves lost
Neighborhood street wars
Scientist manipulating G-4's we not alone
Hurricanes cyclones bomb threats suicide on the Whitestone I palm tecs
Straight from the heart of the hood but overstood
Played my part til I'm parted it should but meant good
Move by the moss and the morns metamorphosis
Offered me optional doors I wanted in
With the wild life wanted to blend but then again
With them satellites they sucking us in we being tracked
So many got chips in they back they blindfold
Me I'm trying to run that victory lap and find codes
Cursed with that ESP I seen they hold papa for a PS3 so is it me
Or majority wanna be slaves
They don't wanna behave but they wanna be saved praise the Lord
Moving on they own accord too content to implement a sharp in they sword so all aboard
Bruised by the height of recession hunger scarce in fears by the vice and infections
I'm aware of the war going on this world we can't escape from
We can run but we can't hide forever
Its deep the system got the masters asleep
Religion mean to rely on they supply and deceit they putting chemicals in food we eat
Polluting the waters it cause slaughter to sheep we the meek
And money ain't worth what its printed on
I'm posted at the Sprint store trying to put minutes on
Its flying on the same line I'm trying to do business on
I guess they applying what they learned from the Pentagon

Fuck out of here...

"Suffocating
And what was on my chest
Out of love, out of line
Nearly out of my mind

I'm tired of waiting
Giving all my best
In a maze, in a haze
I was wasting my time

I was broken, I was scared
But now I'm coming up for air

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
And teaching me to breathe again

Lungs are burning
My walls were closing in
On the floor needing more
Than a door or window

All the hurting wars
I couldn't win
You were there in a prayer
With a glimmer of hope

I was shaken, I was sure
That I would never find the cure

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
Teaching me to breathe again

Teaching me to open up
Teaching me to care
Teaching me to take a chance
Feels like I'm almost there

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
Teaching me to breathe again
Mmm breathe again

You and I are in the same room
We both think we're fair
We both live for truths
But then how are we to define something so subjective
Living under the same roof
So here, these battles of wills
They beg for some proof
Of right versus wrong
Your approach seen as better than mine
Though it's working for you all I feel is disconnection


So now it's your  religion against my  religion
My humble opinion against yours
This does not feel like love
It's your  conviction against my  conviction
And I'd like to know what we'd see
Through the lens of love… love… love… love


And so now your grand assessment
Is that I'm not in your group that I'm not your kind
And so we're locked in a stalemate with you
In your corner and me dismayed in mine


So now it's your  religion against my  religion
My humble opinion against yours
This does not feel like love
It's your  conviction against my  conviction
And I'd like to know what we'd see
Through the lens of love… love… love… love


And this stance keeps us locked in boxing gloves
And this lie remains about us being separate


So now it's your  religion against my  religion
My humble opinion against yours
This does not feel like love
It's your  conviction against my  conviction
And I'd like to know what we'd see

What's one penitent more?
While she was left in the lurch
He was washing ashore

And it's true, you could tell her everything
She never wanted to know
Let her shoot, let her have her massacre
Blood dripping down in the snow

Ring on, Liberty Bell
That's affixed to the prow
Neptune's watery hell
Lives inside of you now

And it's true, you could tell her everything
She never wanted to know
Let her shoot, let her have her massacre
Blood dripping down, leaving trails in the snow

She left offerings I
Didn't want at my door
Two birds baked in a pie
What a grim metaphor

And you spill and confess and you clean up the mess, 'cause
That's how you atone
But when it's ""Bless me, Father,"" then I suspect
She'll never leave you alone

And it's true, you could tell her everything
She never wanted to know
Let her shoot, let her have her massacre
Blood dripping down, leaving trails in the snow

Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow
Walking in a dark world that’s been
Kissed with sadness
Without sunlight things are born
To the dead of nightmares
Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness

Listen closely to the raven’s call
Praying hard for our world not to end
Try as might to make sense of it all
Will it be for the penance of men
Follow north for the call of the wild
Look all out for a small wayward child
Lay in fear as the dark raven crows
Look for guidance from the one who knows
He lived on this earth for a time and a half
Playing a tune to the old man’s laugh
The fear that’s inside the men of the oath
In the script of the book that he wrote


Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin


As the raven again passes by
I can hear all the wake fathers cry
That the first born of all men will die
That their lives will be taken from them
Face the danger a battle of wills
Strength and courage a cure for all ills
We believe in that thou shall not kill
But others are ready to spill


The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I’ll take my last breath


Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin


The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I’ll take my last breath


Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin


Into the valley of death fear no evil
We will go forward no matter the cost
Into the valley of death follow me now
Bring me your souls and I’ll make it our last


Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

In your dreams, a nightingale begins to sing
A twitterpated song
I appear, and then, my dear, you know, at last
Your love has come along
Maybe so, but yes, or no, a while ago
That birdie sang for me
And i just now begin to hope that i'm in your dreams
This is just the intermezzo
Of that moment that we met
So grand, the mem'ry lingers yet
So why let it go?
In my dreams, a nightingale, the one i sent
To sing for you a song
Reappears, with glowing ears, from words he hears
That you have sent along
We shall see how that may be
When next we meet again
As we go, dream-to-dream, to be there then
As it were, -- in your dreams

Well he knew that could happen fuckin with the kid
This is graveyard music right here ya dig?
This is not competition this is murder
Career endin, mind bendin, Southside ya finished
Now look niggas laughin at Cam down on Lenox
They heard what he did but they don't know why he did it
I have eighty of them boys with black flags, come through with black mags
And have you niggas zipped up in black bags
For a second he was hot now he cold
I apply pressure on niggas until they fold
But never mind me, man that's just how it be
The game got me trained they call me the hustle man
And like fame, my style will live forever
They thought I crossover, cause they don't know no better
I think they think I'm laxed now cause I got the cheddar
Till I return back bustin trust me it's nothin

Dead from all the loneliness and this is how I feel
Understanding everything has never been my deal
Maybe you have crossed my path to live inside of me
Or maybe you're the reason why I'm losing all my decency


Cause I believe that you and me
We could be so happy and free
Inside a world of misery
And I believe that you and me
We could be so inside of you, inside of me
Cause this could be the one
This could be the one, this could be the one
This could be the one


I've been lookin', I've been lookin' for my Mrs. Right
But she don't exist, chemistry is everything
And we're anything but this
Maybe I have crossed your path and swept you off your feet
Or maybe I'm the reason why you cry at night before you sleep




But what do you think? We could give it a try
Cause you never know, maybe we could be soul mates
But maybe not, but maybe so
If you never try then you'll never know
The grass could be greener
And it will always be greener on the other side
But you just never know
This could be the one




But maybe so 
But maybe not 
Who knows?


If you're alone I know why
If you can hide then go hide away
But I want you to stay, hey

S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it, let's go!


I've had enough
There's a voice in my head says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along a little fuckin' louder
To a happy song, I'll be alright


You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fuckin' louder
To a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…


Every now and again we get that feelin'
And the great big void inside us opens up
An' I really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
An' I'm goin' 'round in circles, I'm goin' 'round in circles


S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit

We are possessed
We're all fucked in the head, alone and depressed
But if we sing along a little fuckin' louder
To a happy song, maybe we'll forget, 'cause…


Every now and again we get that feelin'
And the great big void inside us opens up
An' I really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
An' I'm goin' 'round in circles, I'm goin' 'round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreamin'
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
An' I really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
An' I'm goin' 'round in circles, I'm goin' 'round in circles


The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay 


So let's sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder!
A little fucking louder!
Well, don't you feel so much better?

Love me in a special way what more can I say
Love me now love love me now


Since Illmatic this shit started that never departed
I flossed retarded for them lost in the projects
I taught them logic gaining courses in college
Chased dollars but to me whats most important is knowledge
Know the ledge for ya'll niggas that so on the edge
It ain't nothin for an infrared to go in your head
Life in the streets schooled me well movin light on my feet
So deep had me jumpin up at night in my sleep
Hold ya heat if you that nigga that's influencing beef
I'm trying to eat dont have me put two in ya feet
99 ways i made out to never fade out never get played out
Got guns blast ya way out




Saw the worst when I was growing
Unknowing my quest until I had reality thrown at my chest
Why would it stress it seem a nigga zone at his best
Is it a test at times I feel my soul is possesed
Flavors of Guess throw key at major connects
Crazy respect goin through it made me a vet
Gettin down on grounds forbidden
Made bails from ?????? to the cells in Clinton listen
We could war till we no more either or
Or just ball till we all score it's on ya'll
Did this one for the streets watchin
And the D's in the streets let them keep clockin
We clean got love for the whole game
To go change fake I.D.'s and the code names but no lames
3 op's and theres more to come we all as one
Recognize I been this raw since young




Was I sent for the sinners that never repent
Or just another thug bent trying to pay for his rent
Days in contempt I see how ya'll amazed in suspense
Ways spent catch me at the major events
So blow a herb on ya corner curb my word
Doe or Die I was born a swerve bet that
From 40 bottles to the champagne twist a pop
White Lables to the brand names kids on top
And let's toast for the lost souls
And pray enough to hope and meet em at the crossroads reunite
Hope I live to see 88 with crazy cake
In a baby shaped burgandy Bentley with Haiti plates

"I'll fake it through the day
With some help from Johnny Walker Red
And the cold pain behind my eyes
That shoots back through my head
With two tickets torn in half and a lot nothing to do
But it's alright cause some enchanted night I'll be with you

Tarot cards and the lines in my hand
Tell me I'm wrong
But they're untrue

I got plans for both of us that involve a trip out of town
To a place I've seen in a magazine that you left lying around
I can't hold my liquor but I keep a good attitude
Cause it's alright some enchanted night I'll be with you

And though you'd rather see me gone
Than to see there come the day
I'll be waiting for you anyway

Next door the TV's flashing blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy from the seventies with a lead no one recalls
He vanished into oblivion
It's easy to do
And I cried a sea when you talked to me
The day you said we were through
But it's alright, some enchanted night I'll be with you

Without even trying when I close my eyes
I see you walking 'round inside of my head
Looking up at the sky shining brighter than a single sunrise
It's ever burned red


And I wanna hold you, hold you
Rolling in the warm sunshine
If I never told you, told you
I'm giving you the rest of my life


'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna dance with my baby
In the dead of the night
Just keep on moving and grooving 'til the daylight
I'll be right beside you, babe, 'til the end of time


I've been bragging about you
Baby, you can bet I've been calling up all of my friends
Don't you know I've been counting down the days?
Feeling just crazy enough to call up your old man


And I wanna hold you, hold you
Rolling in the warm sunshine
If I never told you, told you

Get me out of this place, before I cause more damage
A small price to pay for building houses out of matchsticks;
And when things get too hot, you've got me to blame
For every fire that breaks out in every lover’s name


Don't forget, we've got unfinished business
Stories yet to unfold; Tales that must be retold
And I regret not knowing when to put an end to all this madness
Keeps me wanting, keeps me wanting more


Sell me out, I’m yesterday's old news
Phrases left on paper, black ink bleeding through
The pages where we made our history
Call me foolish, I feel hopeless


Running from lions never felt like such a mistake

Running from lions never felt like such a mistake

Running from lions never felt like such a mistake

Running from lions never felt like such a mistake

Can't stop spacing, and when I'm on the ground

I told niggas I'm a hustler, it's like they keep on forgetting
36 mil in 8 months, you still think I'm bullshitting?
Catch me on top of Fortune's Hot 100
Head of G-Unit Enterprises, still getting blunted
Went from selling crack to rap, that's two different games
But they're parallel to each other, homie, so they're quite the same
You know that crack spot so hot, you better off playing the block
Fiends can't help but be fiends, they come and cop for the cops
Back in the pens again, penitentiary doors spin
The game full of heartbreaks, can I win for Christ sakes?
Ace after ace, Lady Luck just won't fuck with me
That's why I got this attitude, nigga don't say what up to me
I took something heart-pumping, move and I'll pop something
Cop bricks, break 'em down to pieces and prop something
Niggas stay in stunt mode so I stay strapped up
My body language saying ''fuck around and get clapped up''
I sip on Coke when it's with Henny, go for broke with the semi
Niggas talk behind my back, but they don't really want it with me
Pussy niggas pop shit, me I'm on that block shit
That rubber band, hundred grand in that night box, bitch
You know the raps bought the Benz, and the crack's bought the rims
Vivica she bought the gym, told ya I'm a fuckin' pimp
I was born a bad seed, I defied the odds
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I switched the cards
Still I keep a poker face, frontin' I'mma catch a case
Flip out, poke your face, you're laid out, now what a waste

The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right, the Paris night
Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Élysées
We had a drink in each café
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa


We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance


I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain


We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power


But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance


I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play




And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry


How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams


I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
We were living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer...

That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
I ain't mad at ya at all 
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin' Outlaw
That's right nigga, hahaha.. housin' these hoes, you feel me?
Aight, you know what I'm sayin'?
You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?
Keepin' it real!
How old are you nigga?
I'm eleven


Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryna survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we been through
Witnessin' evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'
Pull 'n' fuckin' fire when I leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em
Hostile hoes catch elbows  negroes disposed of
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a


Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 


Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?
High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive
By makin' motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop
Got no time for the court, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin', an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a


Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 



Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggas lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest


So I just ... swallow my Beck's and holla, ""Fuck 'em!""
And if I'm next ... just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin' nuttin'


Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me
 Definitely no need for askin'
 Top speed  laughin' 


Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' 'bout prayin'


They need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggas sprayin' up my block


Tryin' to take my wealth

The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets

But all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's
Stop bein' a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real ill

While cities lie at their feet

A long pain ending without a song to prove it

Who could stand beside you so close to Eden
When you glinted in every eye the held-high razor
Shivering every ram and son?

Now, silent looney-bin
Where the shadows live in the rafters like day-weary bats
Until the turning mind, a radar signal
Lures them to exaggerate mountain-size on the white stone wall
Your tiny limp

How can I leave you in such a house?
Are there no more saints and wizards
To praise their ways with pupils
No more evil to stun with the slap of a wet red tongue?

Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
And rest because he had finally come?

Let me cry help beside you, teacher
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son enters his father's house

And I'm reminded as I stare at this revolving door
Of all the times I've failed, and all the times I've sworn
I'd never give up hope, and change what I stand for

Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us be
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us begin

You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from Demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold

You can feel cold sweat running down your neck
And the dwarves of falseness throw mud at your back

Guided by spells from the old seer's hand
You're suffering pain only steel can stand

Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined

The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust, heat and sway
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust, heat and sway

You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from Demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold

Throw the first key into the sea of hate

Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belonged into the sea of greed
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance

Disease, disease, disease, my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
Throw the key or you may die
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
Throw the key or you may die

On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He's sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He's playing you on with delight

Man, who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven scars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be
Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key, throw the key
Throw the key

An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming and earth swallowing him away

You're the keeper of the seven keys
You've locked up the seven seas
And the seer of visions can now rest in peace
There ain't no more Demons and no more disease
And mankind live up, you're free again
Yes, the tyrant is dead
He is gone, overthrown
You have given our souls back to light

Everything's beautiful
Every day's a holiday, the day you live without it
Everything changes up, everything shifts and falls unless you care about it



But you sit there in the darkness
And you make plans but they're hopeless
And you blame God when you're lonely
And you'll call it fate, when you show up too late and it's over



Here on the boulevard, you were the golden boy
A mix of brains and muscle
That was a lucky break
Luck is a thing you make
Not just another hustle



But you sit there in the darkness
And you make plans but they're hopeless
And you blame God when you're lonely
And you'll call it fate, when you show up too late and it's over



'cause nothing can wait forever
They don't give unlimited chances in life;
They hand you the knife and tell you to cut it around

So baby let's fly;
Baby let's ride, baby let's ride



Cause everything's beautiful, every day's a holiday
But days are getting shorter
The moon and the stars report the boulevard's last resort
And now your last supporter



But you sit there in the darkness
And you make plans but they're hopeless
And you blame God when you're lonely
And you'll call it fate, when you show up too late and it's over

Growing up as an inner city brotha
Where every other had a pops and a motha
I was the product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didn't know what to do with me
Was I somebody they despised?
Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
And poor momma can't control me
""Quit tryin' to save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies!""
A tickin' timebomb, can't nobody fade me
Packin' a 380 and fiendin' for Mercedes
Suckers scatter but it don't matter I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all the buckshots the fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
So they label me a lunatic
Could care less, death or success
Is what I quest 'cause I'm fearless
Now the streets are deathrow



The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow


I just murdered a man, I'm even more stressed, wearin' a vest
Hopin' that they're aimin' at my chest
Much too young to bite the bullet
Hand on the trigga

I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen
Counting pennies over the years I'd done stacked many
Proving wrong those
Who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since it's the only thing I know
It's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
But now I gotta move away now
'Cause these suckers love ta' spray where I lay down
My homie lost his family, he snapped;
Shot up half the block to bring them back
The streets are deathrow



The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow



I'm dangerous when drunk I only drink beer
Gin makes me sin
Unable to think clear
Hennessy makes me think my enemy is getting close
BOOM BOOM BOOM
Got me shooting at a ghost
Some call me crazy but this is what you gave me
Amongst the babies who raised up from the slavery
I sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress
Moved out west and I invest in all the best
Those who test will find a bullet in they chest
Put to rest, by a brotha who was hopeless
Grow up broke, on the rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking comin' from a broken family?
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of the sirens, bodybags, and the guns firin'
Tell Bush, ""Push the button!"" 'cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head
The streets are deathrow



The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow

The streets are deathrow


This go out to my partners in the Live Squad

And all my homies out there involved in that 187
Watch your back
There's got to be a better way
There's too many of us in the cemetery
I love it when they fear me!
Come on, what we gonna do now?
I love it when they fear me!
The streets are deathrow *echoes*

The lady is dying
She bends back like a wave
As her spirit is climbing
Through the hospital wall and away
And I wanted to hold you
As you made your escape
But now I should have told you
When your eyes were alive and awake
Always in life we all must make this mistake


And so I go it alone
And the pressure is great
I hold on to my own
Oh please, oh don't go away


I wanted to know you
Before you started to fade
But I gave everything to
A lie and a farce and a fake
Always in life we all must make this mistake


And so I go it alone
And the pressure is great
I hold on to my own
Oh please, oh don't go away
I'd like to see you when all of these angry days flow away

Chasing, chasing your shadow
Wasting, wasting the battle
Changing, changing the channel
Now all the fuss is just faith without the rush
Remember what it felt like to believe?
Remember running wild and living free?
Remember when the magic was a mystery?
Now all the fuss is just
Faith without the rush


Wait!
Did the rainbow fade?
We won't see beyond our feet
Staring down afraid to leap


Go!
Jump into the wonder
And dance on the thunder
We're crying in color
Breathing infinity
Flying free


Stalling, stalling for nothing
Starving, starving from judging
Talking, talking but what if
All the talk is just truth without the walk
Remember what it felt like to believe?
Remember running wild and living free?
Remember when the magic was a mystery?
Now all the the talk is just
Truth without the walk


Wait!

We won't see beyond our feet
Staring down afraid to leap
Dive beyond the wildest dreams
Dare to wake up and believe


Go!
Jump into the wonder
And dance on the thunder
We're crying in color
Breathing infinity
Flying free

Why are you sleeping
Gotta get outside

Cover the ground on foot
Not hithing arounf your spur

Let 'em pass by with a wink to the eye

I reserve the right to take it to collect them sums I have the right
Don't try to be, there's really no point in you biting me

Like my dog Bobby, he hated the poopl man
So I tried to play Kotter and make things coll
And I said just let him smell you, hold out your hand
He reached it on out, and then bam
He bit him, he bit him so fuckin' hard
Blood was steady gushin' all over my back yard
I kept apologizin', I felt so fuckin' bad
The dude was so cool, he didn't even get mad
He said man don't sweat it, that's the dog's meaning
Took some Neosporin and went bak to his cleaning

Thought I had a dream or else it was a movie
Your mind can have a joint easy like jungle boogie
$600 freebie and I gots my job
Would you mind come but I gots my dog
Come you can foam the water with the bone
I wanna tell my mom, ring her on the phone
Cherry popsicle, icy, cold, freezing
Loves on his gums now that he is teething
Got a wee-wee pass, lay them by the door
Nasty Little s***s he dropped them on the floor

Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you

And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
""I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart
To ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me

Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe""
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
""I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right""
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

Now it's all startin to make sense
I pull up in that brand new Benz
All of a sudden I’ve got brand new friends
Brand new chopper, bitch go blocka

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry


O-o-oh, sweet child o' mine
O-o-oh, sweet love of mine


She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by


O-o-oh, sweet child o' mine
O-o-oh, sweet love of mine
O-o-oh, sweet child o' mine

For a little while, we know what heartache is
And we feel the pain the world can sometimes bring
For a little while, we cry in the night
Without a single song to sing
But one day it all will change
There'll be no more stormy rain
Then at last we will rest forevermore


So if you're in the valley

And life is so unkind

And if your tears keep falling

From your tired eyes

If burdens seem so heavy

And it's hard to smile

Then just remember

It's only for a while


For a little while, you lose someone you love
And you miss the time together that you shared
For a little while, you feel all alone and scared
With no one there to hold
Oh, the nights get long and cold
But it won't last, it will pass in time


So if you're in the valley

And life is so unkind

And if your tears keep falling

From your tired eyes

Your burdens seem so heavy

And it's hard to smile

Oh, you gotta remember

Oh, you better remember, better remember
It's only for a while
Oh, yes, remember

""Fool"" - defined in Webster's
Open up the book, read it, read it
Turn the page, see what it says
Read it to me will you, please


That's you  ‘Cause of the way you act 
Standing on the corner sellin’ jumbos 
Scaring your friends and also your foes
What's the matter wit'cha boy? 
You big galoot , you nincompoop 
What's wrong wit you? You can't compute 
Don't fix your lips to tell me you can
Standing on the boulie playin pusherman
What you got to do with yourself? 
Can't you be somebody else? 
Look at you, described to a tee 
You're a fool of many in society 
I know some more, I shall go on
And continue in the song, fooled the fool

""Fool"" - scratched by Ali Shaheed Muhammad



The girl I talked to she's sort of neurotic 
Her crazy ex-boyfriend is really psychotic 
Scares the girl by threatening her life 
Says ""Girl, you're dead if you're not my wife"" 
Beats in her public, beats her in private 
Tried it 'round me, almost a riot 
Said ""Forget him, don't you know he's a loser
Who would love a woman turn around and abuse her?”
Only a fool as described by the Tribe
Here's another one who's on the fool vibe 
Gonna make it short, gonna make it quick 
For this situation makes me sick 
See your brother man, with the female 
He's crazy ego tried to show he'll prevail 
In any situation, lady luck's on his side 
Emotions run free, nothing he will hide
Why I remember one sunny day 
Took my cousin to the park so we can play 
On the way, a couple resembled
The one I just described, everything assembled
Another young man walked in their direction 
Bumped him a bit, excused his imperfection 
But the man with the lady grabbed the other by the neck 
Demanded an apology and also respect 
The young man aggravated grabbed him back and smacked him
The girl just laughed and laughed and laughed at him 
He felt ashamed for what he had done
It looked like a fool to everyone 
These are three stories from the naked city 
Reality, is sometimes saditty 
Like Rod Serling from The Twilight Zone
Earth to your brain - is anyone home? 
I see ya there, tryin to make amends
Try to make some friends, but now my story ends 
On the note, that I just wrote
Stay afloat on the reality boat 
Slow down and think and take it cool
And try to avoid the description of a fool


Man, Tip, you think you all that now that you on wax
Or something that you can tell a brotha what to do?
You know I’m older than you? I’m your senior, brotha
Man, you better go someplace with that old fool nonsense
I’m gon’ keep doin’ what I gotta do
And survive the way I gotta survive, know’m’sayin’?
You can’t do nuthin’, can’t do nuthin’, man
Know’m’sayin’? I’ve been out here too long doin’ my thing…

In love with you


Lovin' u is easy
Comes so naturally
Lovin' u is easy

Let knowledge drop
Why should I be forced to play dumb?
I know where I came from so I'm going to claim some
But rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
Suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
Stop think of the past the brothers that die for
Sucker to try for never to cry more
Tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
He's a fake not a friend
So he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
Yo he's a trick so he sold his soul for gold
Now I know the reason we must excel
Cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
Move on be strong with unity
Cause that's the only way to build communities
Lies are told but yo lives must move on
And never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop


Drop that 
Let knowledge drop


Yo I'm running so I refuse to stop
Get sweated by them sell out cops
And I wink cause I pin the opposition
I'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach
So listen up to the flavor I gave you now dropping it
We folks know ballers know no stopping it
Dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
I got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm
For the simple fact that I'm black and educated
Proud of who am I and you hated
So all I have tried for this many have die for this
You see it and you hear it and you loving it
Now you buying this always keep your head look to the mountain top
Aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop


Drop that 
Let knowledge drop


Suckers suffocate when I hype this because you can write this
You constantly bite this
Thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
Caught with the dope dose
Now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
Cause you building a boom force
Like what you hearing so your checking with the source
2Pac brother with the rhymes to rock on
Dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
Amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
Suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
I'm not conceited but defeated I won't be
As long as there's dope beats I'll never be lonely stop
And let me breathe a minute
Aiyyo Dizzy what's up put the base back in it


Let knowledge drop 


By any means neccessary it's kind of scary
Knowledge of the hands of adversaries
Makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
I was waiting for a present GOD gave me a goal
I refuse to be busting like a sucker for I'm fighting like a titan
And run you down like a truck
I'll take a chance I vote for rock can see
Not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
Knowledge appealed to me
Pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
The bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
And knowledge drops


Drop that 
Let knowledge drop

She fell right down from the sky

Woah, I got a reefer headed a woman
She fell right down from the sky


Well, I gots to drink me a two-fifths of whiskey
Just to get half as high


When the good Lord made that woman
He sure went to town

Well, when he was feeling high
Ooh, he sure should have been feeling low

This is ""Buzzcut Season""


I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain

Well you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway



Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good


We ride the bus with our knees pulled in
People should see how we're living

Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste



The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good


And I'll never go home again 
Favourite friend 
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun 
Play along 
But I live in a hologram with you


Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us


Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good


And I'll never go home again

Play along

Wounded in the line of duty

And ticket lines, and

Your lot along with the poor

"We are forced to live in silence
Eating dust and breathing violence
Keeping all the suffering within

Let me be the one to hold you
Trying hard, remaining hopeful
Making sure your heart is free of sin

In mother’s scorn
Blood was born
Where we belong
Our nations torn
Passage gone
A war unknown to us all

Waiting to see your conviction
Swallowing proud premonition
Clinging on to hope that slowly dies

Standing in the ruins of nature
Caused by forces born from danger
Cleaning hands where virtues live on ice


In mother’s scorn
Blood was born
A war unknown to us all


See the rays of light dance in hurricanes
The essence of the life held within cruel chains
Come and see the day’s unsolved history
The mirror in the eyes are reflecting the fear
We can’t hide cruel commands
We will see their last stand
From the heart where we belong
Forever blind to the wasteland beyond

Find security
In this misery
Build a world of death
Hear the fallen prey


It's the highest prize

Your minds intricates
In a labyrinth turned inside out


In mother’s scorn
Blood was born
Where we belong
Our nation’s torn
Passage gone
A war unknown to us all


See the rays of light dance in hurricanes
The essence of the life held within cruel chains
Come and see the day’s unsolved history
The mirrors in the eyes are reflecting the fear
See the sands of time play with prophecies
We always end up losing to life’s guarantee
Barren promises feed on your demise
This challenge to be free is a lost enterprise
We can’t hide cruel commands
We will see their last stand
From the heart where we belong
Yet we all know why the cruel commandments came along
Forever blind to the wasteland beyond

How fast it all flies away

When I wanted to stay, you didn't want me around

Now that I want to leave, you be hunting me down

Throwing shit up in my face, steady talking me down 
Fuckin' with them lame-brains, that was on at the time
Now you want to take claims 'cause I'm talk of the town
On your Instagram page, trying to flaunt me around
Make me wish I could rewind back further in time
So I could turn the hands back to a quarter to nine
Nine years ago from the day, now my daughter, she five
And my baby boy one, that's my heart and my pride
You said it was fair exchange, but I call it a bribe
Tryin' to play the blame game but all of it's lies
And instead of pointing the finger, I point at the nine
Finna pop her but she had a doctor's appointment at nine
The tension was so thick, had me warring with minds
Got me considering divorcing my bride
Said she loved me and she won't


Work hard, never rest
Shout to Khaled, but we the best
Angelina Jolie, get this off your chest
Used to shop at Ross, had to dress for less
Now I get free clothes, accidentally flex
It's never less than excellence
My whole squad sick, that's pestilence
Rap game, same shit as wrestling
Choose a back story, grab a corny outfit
Then strut around yappin' like you really 'bout shit
It's 2013, ain't givin' no vouchers
They say I just started, well, bitch, I've been out here
I live this, I breathe this, I sweat this, I bleed this
I want this, I need this like Kanye need Jesus
Like khakis need creases, my world fell to pieces
I stuck to my thesis, the realest, believe it


Uh, let's coast
A couple sirens in the cut gettin' their apple hole
As this scout watched and all beyond his vodka tone 
'Tone Rossi, shoot cannons like rocket launchers
Through the headlines, readin' that, a new dawn upon us
I redefine perilous scares who painted every line
We're here tonight with lyrics between 
Now men get busy between whisky and head, yah
Flick of a finger, they call it flick of the table
We lookin' ice with that Andre, three stacks, ice cold
Unbuttoned button-ups to cuttin' some tight flows
The baby's pukin' off the side of the boat
The bitch is pukin' off the side of the yacht
Alexander on this system when they glide in your block
She kiss at me like a sailor when I arrive at the dock
Drop top, you got' watch with any sniper you got

Who am I to judge
The people who don't care for me
When I don't care about them either?
And who am I to judge
The friends that I once thought I knew?
They're all off doing what they wanna do
I'm falling to pieces
When I'm on my own
Even though I'm a walking emotion
And I can't go a day without you
I saw myself as less and you so high above me
But I hope that you can learn to love me


Four seasons, they've flied by
And I cry, usually in the evening
Before I calm myself and start sleeping
And I'ma sleep in, cause each weekend is like a Monday to me
She stay behind the bar at work
So I'm getting Redbull for free
And I'm so bored of being awkward
I hit my head against a door
Oh, now she made me much less awkward
I'm not so awkward anymore
And I'm flying back to LA
And I can't wait for her to see
And I'm not fucking with first class
But I'd sure like a sleeper seat, so
I'll find a spot that's just for me and see if I can cope
Without an ounce of pain, without an ounce of pain


Now that you're around, I pray you don't go
And we don't even need to mention all the things that matter
Or anything you're stressing 'bout
Just tell me why your day was good
And love me after hours
Now that you're around, I pray you don't go
Cause since you made me social, I'm no longer eating solo
I said thank you, and thanks bro with the wet shirt in the front row
Sweat shirt that's young me playing Erykah, afro
Way back, back when I would have worn a snapback
But fuck that, fuck that
And I hate myself for what I'm 'bout to say
But I feel as if it's time to get away
I'll find a spot that's just for me and see if I can cope
Without an ounce of pain, without an ounce of pain

But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually things die

Handcuffed by the wrist and tied in the feet
So stressed, wish that I could die in my sleep
And Lord knows, thru his grace I done tried it wit peace
But it's like niggas ain't happy 'til they finally deceased
Feel the grief, of a street, nigga that turned to rap
And just applied everything that he learned from crack
I'm in now, it's life ain't no turning back
It been foul so what kinda concerns is that
Peep the signs of the eyes 'cuz it tell it all
One of the few in the streets that was selling it raw
Made mistakes, but it made me intelligent more
And how I move, you could still look and tell I was poor
How can the hate from another man stop my flow
That's like another pimp thinking he can knock my ho
I'm here now, just trying to copp and blow
Couple of cars and lot's of doe

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try

A niggas life in misery
But I'mma keep on doing me, 'til I die

One by one, seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall
You seen one nigga ball, you done seen 'em all
Even standup niggas seen 'em lean and crawl
What makes a man wanna fiend for more
Life itself is more than a trial or a quest
Intelligent wise, it's like I done ran with the best
And very rarely, you can catch me casually dressed
I'm more relaxed in a hat and some sweats
Doing me, been amongst some of the street's most strongest men
Around for months then they gone again
Incarcerated, penalized for the love of they acts
Criminals, cold-hearted, now what's fucing wit that?
Where we at? hit inside of a life that's rarely exposed
Spoken in codes for the killers that daily'll dose
Get yours, hit a quota then get indoors
Get legit then get them stores

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'mma keep on doing me, 'til I die

So now it's on y'all, could see, I done figured it out
Only a few could say that they been in my house
And caroused at my wall color, blend with my couch
I'm as low as you can go in the south
When it's too deep, it's hard for the mind to relate
Some say I'm too street and way too involved wit the snakes
What make a man bigger that life, I'm twice his age
Understand I'm a sinner but I'm nice some ways
Knee-deep in what I speak 'cuz I spit the truth
I become angelic when I sit in the booth
Just a thought of all the ill shit that lurk in streets
How can another real nigga wanna work wit police
Bad enough you got thiefs and the beef is rough
I took an oath just to smoke, eat, sleep and fuck
Knowledge of self, I'mma do this regardless of wealth
Regardless of how the deck and how the cards get dealth

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto

12:45 as the radio booms
Paging you six times
Call you on your cell but it's just a bad line
It's a full moon so I'm bout to howl
Thinkin for a slight, ""Is my girl on the prowl?""
Naw, I guess she wouldn't violate us
Plus hittin' gets for real and she doesn't like to fuss
Callin up the shorty that I met four weeks
On the street, lookin sweet, and I was about to eat
Conscious of my lady but we was on the outs
Had mad love but I had mad doubts
On the phone talkin, gettin on my swerve
But thinkin bout my lady, guess I had some nerve
We was still dreamin and I had a little shot
Cause I didn't even hear it when the door unlocked
""Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?""
Now she standin over me, I said ""I gotta go""
Turned around quick but I hung it up slow
""What's the deal, love, what's goin on?
I see it in ya face, just tell me what's wrong""
""Mm, nothin, I think we need to speak""
""Mm, okay, well, just have a seat""
She wears a frown, she lookin 'round
Sweat comin down and she doesn't make a sound
Tappin on the table growin impatient
I'm gettin up and now I start pacing
She says ""Alright!"" as she starts to conversate
""I'ma do what you do"" then I say ""Elaborate""
""Well you got that girl on the side
What if I had a guy then, too?
Would your heart be broken, boy?
I'd wonder what you do""
""Are you tellin me you got a dude
Who's lovin you better than me?""
""No, but I caught ya ass
So I guess I'm settin you free""
""Yeah, whatever"" as a standin pride
""Me and her is only friends though, we never end, yo
We're gonna still tie intimate ends, yo
I think so, my shit is on lock, ho""
""Word? That's how it's goin?
Well I guess it was really good knowin""
""I'ma still just keep in contact""
""Oh, no, there's no need for that""

Attract me, till it hurts to concentrate
Distract me, stop me doing work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair

Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just too hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Where's my moral parallel?


It takes me half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness for the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track




His own style, right down to his Diesel jeans
Immobile, I can't think by any means
Underwear peeks out the top
I'll let you know when you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you

All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize

Baby now get up on it
Give it to me good
Shawty work it like you should
You follow instructions
Then I follow instructions
The ultimate seduction
More kissing and touching
Feels super natural
First chance I'm at you


To fuck with Ice Cube
You gotta shit talk, big talk, Crip walk
Bang hard, run yards, flip cars
Cause you fucking with millionaires
Big stars
Only clocking a grip will make our

I like it when you freaky
I’m freaky
I’ll explore your body completely
Til you feel like you need me
Chest to chest
I reckon I get to kiss you in neck
Come correct to make a sweat
It’s making us wet
Say my name, say my name
Positions we change
I ain’t joking girl, I’m stroking
I ain’t playing no games
Jackpot, backshot
Still roughly taken
My pleasure is pleasing you
You should feel the same too


Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the
Penitentiary, still ballin'
Riding on these niggas cause they
Lame
In a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug

Up before the sun rise, quicker than
The drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to
Bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas
Hit em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger Lord forgive me if
I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, I'll fuck her
From the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's
Where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggas wonder
Why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see
Who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen
Many peers dead
Niggas still ballin

Taking chances while we dancing
In the party for sure
Slip my ho a forty-fo' and she got

But you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker
Just a-swanging my hair
Bitch quit talking, Crip walk
Stay down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take

Out of town, put it down

Stakes, washed away, washed away
I'm burning down


Roll up, and I light a fucking match to the gas, no gas mask
Make it splash, and all of a sudden, I'm getting ashes
Lasting more than I can fathom
Mass appeal is real it seems, mass didn't appeal to me
Six-six-six, wrists glisten 'cause of slits
Heads missing, so I split
Driven apathy, actually traffic
No tragic car accidents happen
You're just a fucking blip
It only matters 'cause we're matter scatterin' around a hole that gets blacker

Hold up before-

Hold up before I blow up
Give me one more time, I can pour up
Got the wheels spinnin', but my blood's thinning
Oddy telling me that it's time to quit it—but I can't, I'll faint
Just one little taste real quick, so I get straight
I'm so in debt with this shit, I can't pay
I'm so in love with this shit, I can't think, mind gone blank
I just keep sinking, ducked out, sleeping
These drugs my weakness
Seek this money, wrist keep bleeding
And it's seeming that the death of me is gonna be these demons


Sold my soul to Satan waiting in line at the mall
I got six phones, I got six homes
I got a grave six feet tall
What do I know?
Failed chemistry
Hated religion, fuck it all

Saying ""stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver""

I’m walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping


Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone’s distant cry?
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

I’m sick of love but I’m in the thick of it
This kind of love I’m so sick of it


I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them ’till they’re gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

I’m sick of love; I hear the clock tick
This kind of love; I’m lovesick


Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I want to take to the road and plunder
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder

I’m sick of love; I wish I’d never met you
I’m sick of love; I’m trying to forget you


Just don’t know what to do
I’d give anything to be with you

A red priest broke into our classroom
Caught us children by attention
""Listen closely to the words I speak
Lord knows if we’ll ever again meet”

Spoke such words never spoken before
On The Way he declared a war
Miracles like you’ve never seen
From a man who was raised up in the sea

A man is coming in thirteen-one
To charm the daughters and the sons
Scared for our lives, I turned to your hand
Hold this tight while we run, if we still can

Chorus:
What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age
It will land you and me
What tragedy may bring
Whatever may fall
The end of the world
You’ll still belong

Verse 2:
Before the red priest took his last breath
He told me, “Child, now don’t forget
The sun will turn dark very soon
Your days are numbered when there’s blood on the moon

""The earth will shake and the sky will fall
The eyes will open of those involved
Don’t take this son, but you’ll be killed
By the man from seven hills”

A man is coming in thirteen-one
To charm the daughters and the sons
Scared for our lives, I turned to your hand
Hold this tight while we run, if we still can

Chorus:
What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age
It will land you and me
What tragedy may bring
Whatever may fall
At the end of the world

When you hear the voice say your last goodbyes
Look there to the eastern skies
When the ghosts take hold of the men who died
Look children to the eastern sky
When your fathers weep and your mothers cry
Look children to the eastern sky

What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age

See His scepter that stretches the expanse of unmeasured space
Hear Him who holds all things together declare, ""all things are mine without exception""
See the curiosity of the cosmos as Christ condescends to His most cherished creatures
See the astonishment of angels as the Almighty advances towards Earth
See the humility of the pre-existent King born of a virgin birth
The Infinite becomes infant, the Maker becomes man
The Divine becomes despised, and the Christ is crucified
The Author of all creation cursed upon the tree that He Himself spoke into being
And the Lord of life was laid in the tomb, but the grave could not contain Him and so the Son of Man was raised to life
But why?
To draw near, to pierce our greatest fear
To shed satisfying blood on our behalf
To give back the life we were meant to have
To enjoy, to hear, to adore, to taste
And to look with peace upon our Savior's face
And to embrace Him with an undying faith
To interpose all His worthiness into us
And serve the most unworthy and undeserving
He is our God and we are mere men made by Him
We are not like Him, but He loves us and moves among us

Did you ever realize that universe just means one song
Your soul knew it all along, you were dancing when you were born
Yeah


Contemplating time and space
Light is raging then erase
How I stand in the same place?
Connect the million by the waist 
ESPN with the mace
It come to me when I gaze
And when I listenin' to waste
My mind receive it then it plays


Forward, forward, forward, forward
But it takes you just to lay back, lay back, lay back
Lean forward, forward, forward
I think it's really cool to lay back, lay back, lay back
Come on and lean forward, forward, forward
They keep telling you to lay back, lay back, lay back
But you gotta lean forward, forward, forward, forward
They say come on man lay back, lay back, lay back


It's what possessed the slave to look in the river 
Then he saw his true master, fuck is a mister?

And sober is the only worthy system 
And he's the co-creator with the giver


Detach yourself 
Re-pack yourself
Be back yourself 
And dream as yourself
Be seen as yourself 
Beam as yourself
Scream as yourself 
And be king of yourself

Light is raging then erase

It's a new decade
The Native Tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo
The usual rhythm


Devoted to, the art of moving butts
The rhythm's happening, and it's moving up
The Tribe has been on hold for much too long
Don't fear the rhythm because it's strong
On the corners, brothers bop their heads
From the high-tops to the natty dreads
I'm a nubian y'all, look what we did
Took the crust away from the third eyelid
Now it's kinda open, longs to see the sight
Rhythms of the Tribe which is passed outright
Night after night, day after day
Questing for the rhythms of the Native Tongue way
Rhythm is the key as we open up the door
Things a B-boy has never seen before
Poly-rhythm addict with a big fat boom
You have an eargasm as you start to consume
The ghetto beat with a ghetto poem
Yeah, it's from the heart, 'cause it's from the home
Jarobi, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Call me Koala, got what you need
You're a disc jock, then jock this
Rhythms can't lose, rhythms can't miss
If you feel uptight and you need to freak
It'll be alright once we drop this beat

I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm


Ma Massa-ya, Ma Makossa
Gets hectic, freak a bourgeois
We quest around for the musical heart
On avenues, streets and boulevards
Not selling out, that's a negative
Loving Hip Hop, loving heritage
Got the instinct to travel miles and miles
Gotta whole lot of rhythm, piles and piles
Now you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk
From the Zulu Nation, topping all the junk
Standing on the top like the Temptations said
Rhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed
Read what I read, can't be better said
Tribe'll lick motions dabble in the head
Sweetback's bad, not as bad as a beat
It's a 
Continue, on the windy road
But, I'm lugging, a crazy big load
Will we be on point for the ninety dec
Is it muscle bound and will it flex?
But trudging, we are used to
You don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew
We're four, once more, must make the tracks
You see four fronts, but now you see four backs


I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm

Free falling, fate's warning, find a life to hold on
Soul stealers, true believers, rise now they are gone!

And as they ride away, forsake the one to save us
Winter's mourning on a lost, fallen world
Pray now united, in a lifetime alone
Won't you wait for the silence so strong?
Wait for the dawn!

Tonight!
Falling like the rain, insanity lives on
Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying
Raging endlessly they come
And the morning light will hide the darkener days gone by
And the Sun will shine again across the blazing skies
Glorious eternally, we'll rise above the World
Marching on till victory we fight!
The Fire still burns!

Looking back our passing lives, their memories to see
Flick through the passages of silence
Hidden by the sacrifice, to set the Demons free
Now they understand: reclaim the land relentless

Fear calling, transforming, stand alone in our time
Advocation, desolation, slay the vision divine

And all the stars fall around the World tonight
Silent forces from a past life return
Pray for the silence in a world so alone
Till we touch the horizon beyond!
Fly through the storm!

Tonight!
Falling like the rain, insanity lives on
Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying
Raging endlessly they come
And the morning light will hide the darkener days gone by
And the Sun will shine again across the blazing skies
Glorious eternally, we'll rise above the World
Marching unto victory we fight!
The Fire still burns!

The tears in your eyes, a lifetime of misery
In the silence we stand all alone for the fate of our own destiny
A lifetime of lies, one chance at this fantasy
The judgment will pass for the cries of the World that has faded for me

Tonight!
Falling like the rain, insanity lives on
Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying
Raging endlessly they come
And the morning light will hide the darkener days gone by
And the Sun will shine again across the blazing skies
Glorious eternally, we'll rise above the World
Marching unto victory we fight!
The Fire still burns!

Me, and my helmet such an un-conventional kid
All intense and kinetic, at best tolerated from afar
Not yet arrested, and by that I mean betrothed
Though a start I am newly courted
I've just not been trusted with alters


I'm a sweet piece of work, well intentioned yet disturbed
Wrongly label-ed and under-fed, treated like a rose as an orchid


My friends, as they weigh in, get understandably protective
They have a hard time being objective
So inside we cancel each other out


I'm a sweet piece of work, well intentioned yet disturbed
Wrongly label-ed and under-fed, treated like a rose as an orchid


You've brought water to me, making sure my bloom rebounds
You know best of what my special care allows


So I've lived in my blind spot
Thought myself usual when I'm not
And your garden is a nice spot
As long as it is brave and where you are


For this sweet piece of work, high maintenance and deserted
I've been different and deserving, treated like a rose as an orchid
Sweet piece of work, overwhelmed un-observed
I've been bowed down to but so misread
Treated like a rose as an orchid

Tired of us talking about dirt roads, tailgates, tan lines, and corn rows
It sounds made up, but that's the life I know
We know all about some moonshine, moonlight, bonfires
Seeing all the stars on a summer night
Don't see how that's getting old


Ride with us on Friday night
See if we ain't jacked them up
See if we ain't setting it on fire
See if we don't burn it up
See if we ain't cranking Hank
Sipping on a little something strong
Hey man, you'll see why we can't
Quit singing that same old song
The same old song


You heard enough about red dirt
Blue collar dollars and hard work
5 o'clock heading to the outskirts
3 chords and the truth
Tired of hearing 'bout them tan legs
Bare feet on the dash, sundress, Daisy dukes, boots and ray-bans
You ain't even seen them move


Hang loose on a Friday night
Man ain't they looking tough?
See if they ain't blowing your mind
See if you don't fall in love
Let her find that country station
Then watch her sing along
Hey man you'll see why we can't
Quit singing that same old song
That same old song

Just when you think
You've heard it all about a small town
All that small talk going round
That ain't all we're all about
Sit with us on Sunday morning
Bow your head and let us pray
Close your eyes and let the Lord in
Tell me you don't feel a thing
When we sing Amazing Grace
Come on, man, sing along
You 'bout to see why we can't
Quit singin' that same old...

With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet


You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour


The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men

Let me flaunt the style, I think that the time's near
That we drop Scuds, there won't be no duds here
Rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
But when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
Now I'm not for the rock, I know the territory
Go ahead and try, that's a different story
Similar to Grimm, I could tell a better one
All about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
Stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
Resorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some
No never ever, go back and try again man
If you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand
Competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
The Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts
Do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
We know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
Gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
If the hands clap I'm filled with elation
Here I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
Think I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream
Cause that's how good it feels child
Let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
Do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
Division we will fall, we must stick together, see
I'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G
The name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder
Giving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa
As a man in the world, I must do my job
Take care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob
Bob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness
Obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
Like shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks
The industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
Peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
Not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock


I don't know what to say, but here I go freak it
If the papes come, then you know I'll seek it
I'm just a short brother, dark skin face
Weigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist
Hair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley
To this day I still believe that no MC can serve me
Brothers try to front, but everybody know
I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show

Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double

I don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got
My vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
It's only legendary, my father well prepared me
My job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot
Better yet the long term, I don't have a perm
In a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps

"True love is a rose
Behind glass
That's locked and kept closed
Maybe just to me
'Cause my heart's been attacked
And shattered by tough love
Bad love

So I bought mine off the street
True love, man, it just can't be beat
I felt so complete
Married to heavenly bodies above
And each night I'd look up
At a bright honey moon

'Cause it sure seemed built to last
And even after my honeymoon passed
I kept right with it, man
Like a ghost to a house it once haunted

And day after day
I'd steal with my true love away
To some hideout
We're left undisturbed
We could do what we wanted
But I started to feel like a liar
Saying I love you

She was madly in love or mad mean
There was no in between
It raised my alarm
I found I can't make a stand
I'm her hired hand
I have to do harm

One day I got sick
She played me a nasty old trick
Said, ""I need cigarettes""
Walked 'round the block
Caught a cab
Stayed gone for too long
My love had gotten so strong
Just to try being back on my own
I had to go to rehab

All I need is a safe place to bleed
Is this where it's at?
Half of no chance
Steps in a dance
Rest of my life spent in combat

Now I'm the king of the ward
'Cause I'm good and I swallow my sword
And puke it out for the doctor
To write me a new prescription
Tranquil as a dove
People that have lost their true love
They all seem to fit the same description

I feel cold, useless and old
I wish I was no one

Take me up today
Take me out of this place
Take me up with you today

Midnight in Montgomery, Silver Eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down


And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there?


'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there


Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry


'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky

While my brothers and me lay around in the shade of that live oak tree on the hill

Overlooking momma's porch with a fresh coat of paint
And a shiny new Coup De Ville

I've been through hell and found myself on the wrong end of a gun
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven but it's closer than I've ever been

Check it off your bucket list, seal it with a kiss

The Lord and I've been friends for a mighty long time
Ooh hoo, Belle
Leaving Him has never ever really crossed my mind
Let me say just one thing
I'd never go so far, mmm
'Cause it's Him no matter who you are, oh hoo

Oh, it's you that I want, but it's Him that I need


I'd like to take a little minute just to say now

The laughter of the sound has quieted down
Ooh hoo, mmm, Belle
The best thing we could do is have Him around
Now. I'm not playing, little lady, let me say this one thing
I think if love could abound
My heart was lost but now it's found
Ooh hoo, Belle
Oh, let's you and I let His love come down


I'm so happy, happy about that now, say this
Seems so easy to me
To try to act naturally
Let's not waste each other's time, time, ooh hoo

He's my surprise and, Lord, he's my joy
My joy, not a toy

Hey, He brought me safe thus far

Right now, I feel like a bird
Caged without a key
Everyone comes to stare at me
With so much joy and reverie
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile, I cry
They don't know what they're doing to me
Keeping me from flying
That's why I say that...


I know why the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song
She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free?


So she can fly, fly, fly
Spreading her wings and her song
Let her
Fly, fly fly
For the whole world to see


She's like caged bird
Fly, fly
Ooh, just let her fly
Just let her fly
Just let her fly
Spread the wings
Spread the beauty

Though it seemed so easy...


And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine

But won't you wait
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great

You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool that makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt
You're still my favorite girl
You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world

That she’s in the crowd of my show?
Nothing to lose
She’s standing right in the front row
The perfect view
'Cause she came along on her own
And there’s something that you should know
You’re so out of reach
And I'm finding it hard 'cause
You make me feel, you make me feel
Yeah, she makes me feel, she makes me feel

Final sign of veracity in the open palm of your enemy
Going down, down, down, it's a sign of my own demise
A confirmation of my final destination
To a torment of hopeless cries

Emancipation of the human mind, 'cause

"As the sun shines down on the land
So her heart is crying for love
And there is no-one there, no-one to hear her voice
And she will sleep alone again tonight
Now the moon is high in the sky
In her room she calls out his name
But he is somewhere else, somewhere she cannot see
Oh, and the night is dark between them now
""My God, my God, why did he go away?""

Now the sun shines on a new town
With a smile, he gets off the train
He lights a cigarette, leans back to see the sky
Oh, and he thinks how much better off he is
Without her hanging 'round, let's do it

And the day is passing by him and he has nowhere to stay
At a lonely bar-room table, his mind goes back to yesterday
To the girl who's dead and buried, but her face lives in his eyes
He must forget that face forever, make the future start tonight
Forget it

But the meal he eats is dead flesh, there is cancer in his cigarettes
And the drinks won't do a thing for him
But revive some stupid memories
Then a hairstyle that reminds him, makes him run into the night
Where the moon hangs high above him now
The same moon that she's praying on tonight
But the wind catches her words
And the moon swallows them whole

Now the moon is high in the sky
In her room she calls out his name
The night is cold and dark, and she is all alone
The bed is empty now, her body screams for love
She wants to be with him, oh, but he's so far away
Oh, and the night is dark between them now

Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter 'bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies, is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting Daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin’
I bit some matches then sipped some gas and went kiss a dragon


I’m really rappin’, no finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin
What’s really happnin’ bro? Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer


Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the SWAT is comin’
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin', aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets, honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin', I'll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject
Lord, why you took Rabbit from me? He say, ""Don't ask me nothing""
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin', I heard they stung you
It’s gon' be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don't even mumble


I’m back to ballin', I'm in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That's codeine, turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In four minutes I'll turn this into forensics
In a foreign car with a foreign broad that’s long winded
Paper long and you taking long, you just don't get it
Hung the phone up on Satan, told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin’ like, ""Hi, officer""
When he ask me why I was swerving, ""I’m high, officer""

Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn
Hanging 'round the gardens of Babylon
Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up 
She gets more fan mail than the Pope 
She takes the Mickey out of all my phobias
Like signing cheques to ward off double pneumonia


Life is minestrone served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold lasagne suspended in deep freeze


I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa
Had an eyeful of the tower in France
I'm hanging 'round the gardens of Madison
The seat of learning and the flush of success
Relieves a constipated mind
I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner
A fitting menu for a dilettante

'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time 
How it start, how it start?


Started off with runnin' from coppers
Duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin' the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF state Feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us, wasn't bitter or sweet
See, if a nigga don't hustle, then the nigga don't eat
On these streets, livin' do or die, circle complete
Repetitive motions of felons in a rush for G's
Please understand my history, a man of many hats
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, in the cracks, but blind
Even though we have hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain


Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Stranded in the County in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my 21 birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls… lost souls, nigga
For my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time


My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with a three-five
When he get out, would I be dead or alive?
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin' trap shut
My mom dukes got a little bit of thug in her
The devil loves sinners: crackheads and drug dealers
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin' over
Never stayin' sober, the brain over and over
Backtrack, my stack's fat, I used to take new
One love to my crew, ayo, this one's for you


R.I.P. … rest in peace to Mu grandmother
Know what we gotta do, baby, one-time


Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time!
One-time! One-time! One-time!


I was born 22 years ago yesterday
But see, I saw no reason for me to celebrate
Let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein' consumed, already predictin' my doom
Soon to be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done, tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin' the time of day
Crime for pay, I'm on my way
But don't know where I'ma end up
I swear to God, it's just a set-up
And these are the words from the mind of a lost soul


Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time

So take the lead


Oh Lord

Will you take away my fear
I'll follow you when the sun shines
And the shadow is drawing near
Down the long and winding road
You'll always lead me home


If the water looks too deep
And the desert looks too dry

Tell me why you're walking when I taught you how to fly
With every step I take
I feel the weight go away
I couldn't even see
When I didn't think of you
You thought of me
So take the lead




When I turn away
Starting to change
You still remain unshakable
Calling my name
To come in from the rain
You'll be okay

I follow you through the darkness
As you took away my fear
I'll follow you in the valley
As you wipe away my ears
I follow you when the sun shines
And the cloud have disappeared
It's been a long and winding road

Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin


Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up


Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up


Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter


And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this

While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz

Oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me

And will he take me back again

Shade the path that I am walking
As I make my way back up that windy road again
The smell of mountain laurel fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I near my journey's end

Wonder if he wants me
I wonder does he love me still

"The king's crossing was the main attraction
Dominos are falling in a chain reaction
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me
Whiskey works better than beer

The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final
And nobody gets a reprieve
And every wave is tidal
If you hang around
You're going to get wet

I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
All you can do now is watch the shells
The game looks easy, that's why it sells
Frustrated fireworks inside your head
Are going to stand and deliver talk instead
The method acting that pays my bills
Keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly Hills
I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity
And I get my check from the trash treasury
Because I took my own insides out

It don't matter because I have no sex life
All I want to do now is inject my ex-wife
I've seen the movie
And I know what happens

It's Christmas time
And the needles on the tree
A skinny Santa is bringing something to me
His voice is overwhelming
But his speech is slurred
And I only understand every other word
Open your parachute and grab your gun
Falling down like an omen, a setting sun
Read the part and we turn out fine
It's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive
But I don't care if I fuck up
I'm going on a date
With a rich white lady
Ain't life great?
Give me one good reason not to do it

So do it

This is the place where time reverses
Dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
Instruments shine on a silver tray
Don't let me get carried away
Don't let me get carried away
Don't let me be carried away

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' 80 on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it

Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches

Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me

These niggas play these Cali days

Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck

Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me, hahaha
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end
And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours too
Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me


That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you


You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me


Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say


I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you


You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me


But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I find myself with you


And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

That's where my ancestors lived and died

But Texas always keeps me satisfied

Haven't got a worry, haven't got a care
Haven't got a thing to call my own
Tho' I'm out of money I'm a millionaire
I still have my home in San Antone

When I greet my neighbor with a howdy all
I'm wealthy as a king upon a throne
You can have your mansion or a cottage small
I'll just take my home in San Antone

Traveled o'er the country on my merry way
Been in crowds and felt I was alone
When I feel like bragging I just up and say
I'm a native son of San Antone

There's a sweet somebody by the Alamo
Someday she's gonna be my very own
Then we'll get a highchair in a year or so
For our little home in San Antone

Oscuro come l'ombra
Contro un muro

La resa è consumata
Ridotta ad un bisbiglio
La voce di una donna
La foto di suo figlio

Caduto in uno spasimo
Rapito al suo cammino
Spezzato dentro a un piatto
Pane e vino

Dove portano I passi che facciamo
Dove portano I passi che seguiamo

Nessuno sa il principio
Nessuno sa la fine
Guardar marcire I frutti
Per masticare spine

Nel buio delle viscere
Il morso del dolore
Negli occhi di un bambino
Cresciuto nel rancore

Lasciato solo al bivio
Trovato dal destino
Che carica il cannone
Gli scappa nel mirino

Dove portano I passi che facciamo
Dove portano I passi che seguiamo

Nessuno sa il principio
Nessuno sa il futuro
Che aspetta come l'ombra
Contro un muro

E non sarà un bastone
Nè il fumo di un fucile
A fare forte un uomo
A farlo meno vile

Gli basterà una lacrima
Limpido segnale
Che può sentire amore
Che può fuggire il male

Gli basterà una lacrima
Visibile cammino
Dal fondo della notte
Dal chiaro del mattino

And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge

Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask for currency
But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave
Honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thang to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thang if he could
Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me 'will I change?'
I tell her yea, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time


So take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again

So I can fly, 'til the end of time
Take, these broken wings...

This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a player I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time


Take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again

So I can fly, 'til the end of time
Take, these broken wings...


Take, these broken wings
You got to learn to fly, learn to live so free

So we can fly away, 'til the end of time
Take, these broken wings...


Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life as an Outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end drinkin' Hennessy made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace 
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G
Remember me, as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about, more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time


Take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again

So I can fly, 'til the end of time


Take, these broken wings
You got to learn to fly, learn to live so free

So we can fly away, 'til the end of time
'til the end of..


I don't know what it is that got me actin' all crazy out here
Guess it's just my environment, how you people be treatin'

When it comes I'll be like, I can't tell you what?

It's going down if I say so
I come to raise hell, call me Halo
I'm growing up
I'll be out in a couple months
See right now I'm hanging out in my mama front
Oh dad, I heard you used to like sports, yeah?
Used to keep money in a sports bag
Heaven said you ain't be home in some weeks, nigga
Don't go starting that shit with me, nigga
By the time I get bigger I need a father figure
Someone to lean on
Sipping lean with your team,  big screen on you
You looking like a fiend, ho
You rap about triple beams only
In every argument you try to make my mama seem wrong
Fuck you, nigga




And Harmony know I'm coming
She would no longer be the youngest
She keep kicking mama in the stomach
I'm gon kick your ass when I get there
You know sibling rivalry, it's all love
We'll all fight and then all hug
Like damn daddy got a ball court
I'm like damn daddy got a four wheeler
Damn daddy got a sports car
Damn daddy been wanting a lil nigga
We got enough land to find Sasquatch
Damn mommy, daddy making money
What the hell you complaining about?
So what if he was fucking with girls
As long as he don't even bring them hoes to the house
Heaven straight, Harmony cool
I can't wait to get my own room
I can't wait till home room

If somebody asked you to surrender
And that was the only way to win
If somebody offered you the freedom to open your mind again
Would you take that flight
Would you walk right in


So meet me down at the bottom line
And open my heart with your hands
And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling
And find where the truth has been
Down at the bottom line


If somebody led you to the water
If somebody taught you  how to swim
If somebody took your doubt and turned it out
And then you could breathe again
Would you take that chance
Would you dive right in


So meet me down at the bottom line
And open my heart with your hands
And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling
And find where the truth has been
Down at the bottom line


What if the wind blows
The cradle will fall
What if the wise man knows nothing at all
We justify
We crucify
But we don't have the balls to cry


So meet me down at the bottom line
And open my heart with your hands
And we'll hear the sound of pretenses falling
And find where the truth has been
Down at the bottom line

My foundation was rocked
My tried and true way to deal was to vanish
My departures were old I stood in the room shaking in my boots
At that particular time love had challenged me to stay
At that particular moment I knew not run away again
That particular month I was ready to investigate with you
At that particular time


We thought a break would be good for four months we sat and vacillated
We thought a small time apart would clear up the doubts that were abounding
At that particular time love encouraged me to wait
At that particular moment it helped me to be patient
That particular month we needed time to marinate in what ""us"" meant


I've always wanted for you what you've wanted for yourself
And yet I wanted to save us high water or hell
And I kept on ignoring the ambivalence you felt
And in the meantime I lost myself
In the meantime I lost myself
I'm sorry I lost myself¡-.i am


You knew you needed more time time spent alone with no distraction
You felt you needed to fly solo and high to define what you wanted
At that particular time love encouraged me to leave
At that particular moment I knew staying with you meant deserting me
That particular month was harder than you'd believe but I still left

Tell me you found your faults
Then tell me I'm stubborn, tell me I smother
Tell me I wrecked it all

And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “Tell it to my face”
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick

Imagine her
Standing there
Young again
Long brown hair
As he crosses over
To the other side
She smiles at him
He runs at her
With arms open wide


She was his reason for living
She was his rock and his best friend
They'll be reunited in heaven
'Cause he's dying to see her again


He went down hill
Once she was gone
Lost the will, to carry on
They couldn't find nothing wrong
No matter what they did
But I know the answers in the picture frame that's sitting by his desk


She was his reason for living
She was his rock and his best friend
They'll be reunited in heaven
'Cause he's dying to see her again


As the doctors come running
I overhear a nurse say ""were loosin' him""
We've been losing him since he lost her


She was his reason for living
She was his rock and his best friend
They'll be reunited in heaven
'Cause he's dying to see her again

Just another lesson learned
Wear a scar, a bore repeating
Take a simple fateful turn
Opened up to stop the bleeding

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding


Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining


Just another brick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding


Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all

The bleeding color gone to black, dying like a day
Couldn't figure out what made you so unhappy
Shook your head to say, ""No, no, no""
And stopped for a spell, and stayed that way


Oh well, okay


I got pictures, I just don't see it anymore
Climbing hour upon hour through a total bore
With the one I keep, where it never fades
In the safety of a pitch-black mind
An airless cell that blocks the day


Oh well, okay

Do me a favor and let me know

Once upon a time
Is how it always goes
But I'll make it brief
What was started out
With such excitement
Now I gladly end with relief
In what now has become a familiar motif


That nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage
Determined to lose it all


Critics at their worst
Could never criticize
The way that you do
No, there's no one else I find
To undermine or dash a hope
Quite like you
And you do it so casually, too


Cause nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage
Determined to lose it all


Ladies and gentlemen
Here's exhibit A
Didn't I try again
And did the effort pay?
Wouldn't a smarter man
Simply walk away?


It doesn't really help
That you can never say
What you're looking for
But you'll know it when you hear it
Know it when you see it
Walk through the door
So you say, so you've said
Many times before

And something to sabotage
Determined to lose it all

John met me down on the boulevard
Cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here


This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear


Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear


This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear




Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear


I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere

And suppose I said I wanna come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone


If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too? And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say


I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again


If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began


Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely?
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

Pretty older women in skirts, conversation frisky
Stinking cigarettes and plenty of bourbon whiskey
Sad classic music on the jukebox of doom
Hollywood Boulevard, barfly frolic room
Tomb of lost souls, some beyond salvage
Some just having fun opening steam valvage
I was one becoming the other, hellbent to discover
Had to pull up the reigns or else smother, take it brother

Anche se qualcosa avessi da mangiar

Deve capire che al Sabato un uomo
Non puo restare senza donna e digiuno

Starin' at the world through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level, you know what I mean? Starin'


Multiple gunshots clear the block, the fun stops
Snitches is callin' cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin'
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin'
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me, then they lie to me
Product of a dyin' breed; all my homies tryin' weed
Now the little babies crazed, raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through intermissions, search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview


They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers


Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin' until our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview


Now, I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section, from years of chin-checkin'
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm gettin' hotter 'cause the world's gettin' colder
Baby, let me hold ya: talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!


Now I know the answers to the question
“Do dreams come true?”
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I said, now I know the answer
“Do dreams come true?”
Starin' at the world through my rearview


They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
'Cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets
Somethin' I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed, bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rearview


Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So, since you ain't knowin' what we mean, let me break it better understandin' the world…The world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understandin' on the game, and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So, now we lookin' at the world from, high watch, behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do: just gotta put our mind to it and do it, it's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggas do what they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can

You are alternately thrilled and desperate

You haven't done much of anything

I heard ya'll niggas on that fly shit
Yeah that trap or die shit
Thrown on the block don't let it get too hot
And moving that ""get you high shit""
Me I'm in that cockpit
On my suit and tie shit
Tryna cash it and ready or not tryna get up in them pockets
Fully packed up and holy
Best believe that it's loaded
Telling you now brother
Try that shit and your casket will be closed ay
A hundred stacks and we throw it
Ain't none of it stolen
And if you think you gon' take from us
Well we'll point at ya and blow it so..


Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now

Don't bother nobody
Unless they bring a fight to my party
Well then hey
That means they're asking for it
They're asking for it
Like I'm asking her to break it on down 
Break it on down 
Break it on down 
Break it on down 

Ha look out guess who it is
That nigga from Atlanta
Where the best do it is
So get your money together and bet who it is
Cause when it comes to spitting lyrics I'm the best in the business
Go by the name of Luda
The industry intruder
Collipark Park G.A
Where the hustlas stay and the criminals rob us, shoot us
On the corner with the keys in hand
We'll leave you where you stand
We'll lift you off your feet and make you fly like Peter Pan
Don't make no sudden moves
Or I'll squeeze my southern tools
While I'm with my southern bitch
26 inches no southern shoes
I ride out slide out
Groupies cry they eyes out
Cause I'm making the kind of paper that dope boys get when they bring them pies out
Wasn't born with a silver spoon
So recognise when you hear that tune
You better drop down low when you hear that
When you hear that
Hear that boom






I know that you like it
Your body's what I'm enticed with
Move around like you work it girl
But that ain't you in the slightest
Love the way that she hide it
Says she want me inside it
Baby girl got the Superwoman
And I'm a kryptonite it
She feeling so weak
Made her drop to her knees
Got a taste of this ?
Taller than all of your trees
She'll pin me down to my seat
And rolling hips to the beat
I had to come and take full control
And show her how it's gon' be
And told her

Oh maybe you will give a little time to me

Always, always


Can you hear me when I'm way down here
Maybe you will one day walk away from me
Stay close when the wind's howling
And never let me go


Always, sure as the rising sun

Always, the way that all good things come

I'm America's Sweetheart
Trying to get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
I am so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid


But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear


So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid


We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man that never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came


So, baby, now I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid


And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years


But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid


Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid

As a girl I watched the sailing ships
Like white birds on the sea
Their sails were wings that rode the wind
My heart longed to be free
I saw you standing by the sea
The beach was dark as death
But your hand was warm against my face
Your kiss was my life's breath


And loving you's like drowning in a storm out on the sea
Put your arms around me darling
Now and rescue me
And loving you's like drowning and I feel so far from home
Put your arms around me
And I'll never sail alone


You never said you'd stay with me
I never tied your hands
The way some frightened women do to keep their love on land
Where they can walk dry-footed
And never fear the tide
Or the moon upon the water
In their lover's arms they hide


And loving you's like drowning in a storm out on the sea
Put your arms around me darling
Now and rescue me
And loving you's like drowning and I feel so far from home
Put your arms around me
And I'll never sail alone


The rain upon my body beat me down upon the sand
And the clouds came low and lonely
Like lost sailors seeking land
Soon I learned that lovin' you means drowning in the sea
When you closed your arms against me
And you turned your back on me


And loving you's like drowning in a storm out on the sea
Put your arms around me darling
Now and rescue me
And loving you's like drowning and I feel so far from home
Put your arms around me
And I'll never sail alone
And loving you's like drowning in a storm out on the sea
Put your arms around me darling

You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair!


Cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy


You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through - I'm OK
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay?


Cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy


He said ""the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learnt""
I said ""You don't know what love is - get a grip!""
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I get in from work at 2 A.M
And sit down with a beer
Turn on late night TV and
Then I wonder why I am here


It's meaningless and trivial
And it washes over me
And once again I wonder
Is this all there is for me


Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own


Life seems so pathetic
I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed
These walls that fall in on my mind


Hold on for something better
That just drags you through the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on and
Try to take the hurt?

Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add onto your pain and suffering

Another truth you can never believe

But we have to keep doing it, or else we're lost, and love is dead, and humanity just packed in. Because love is the best thing we do. Look, I know that sounds cheesy, but it's just true. You love Barney, and he loves you

I can't find a reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love
And she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven
Without you it ain't worth livin' alone


Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine?


I took out all the pictures of our wedding day
It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay


Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?


I can give you two good reasons
To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you
So how can I tell them you've changed your mind?

And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away

Your burden is the way
So, there is no better time

And I patched up your broken wing
And hung around for a while
Trying to keep your spirits
And your fever down


I knew someday that you would fly away
For love's the greatest healer, to be found


So leave me if you need to
I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground


Fly on, fly on past, the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up, than to see you down


So leave me if you need to
I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground ...

"Falling into stringencies
I never thought that I would be here
Dependence on, the evenings
I'm out of touch
It's too late to hide what you kept hid
What explains with words were crooks
I'm falling out, x2
Of touch with myself

I felt like this since forever
This is killing me
X2

What escaped
Was what I dreamt then blurry eyes said the stories
I'm broke apart, fading hours, empty dreams
Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends. x2
I wore the same routines over every fucking night
I'm beginning to lose faith in friendships, I

I felt like this since forever
This is killing me

Lift me up from this never ending fear of myself
Dependence on the evenings to get me through
Show me the line, I can't just walk away

How much longer

Blurry eyes, broken clocks, fading hours

Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends. x2

All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from saint angel
Say ""the weather down here so fine""
Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand
Fever roll up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground
See here how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up
And then the
Sun it going down
Shine through my window and
My friends they come around


Come around
Come around


The people may know but
The people don't care
That a man could be
As poor as me
""Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now let's go run
And see""
Run and see
Hey, hey
Run and see

"Now the Swan it floated on the English river
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer
And the judges watched us from the other side

I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you
Preserve my room but do not shed a tear
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you
It was half my fault and half the atmosphere""

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever
And the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame
She said at last I was her finest lover
And if she withered I would be to blame

The judges said you missed it by a fraction
Rise up and brace your troops for the attack
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action
Oh see the men of action falling back

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still
My falsity had stung me like a hornet
The poison sank and it paralysed my will

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers
That they had been deserted from above
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona
I'm listed with the enemies of love

And long ago she said ""I must be leaving
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""

So daily I renew my idle duty
I touch her here and there -- I know my place
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty
And people call me traitor to my face

This heartbreak is never-ending, it's like it never happened
A fall from grace is close, why not speed it up?
I've never been so angry to find out that I failed
It didn't even work, I have to make amends
I shot him from the window, the world just held its breath
And I made my escape as if no-one could see
I took off in my pick-up, kids screaming in the back seat
They heard the shots too and screamed cause that's their way


I do it alright in my own way, I do it alright in my own way
I do it alright in my own way, I do it alright in my own way


We've all got bigger plans but when it comes down to it
Mine might save the world at least for one more day
Don't judge me from your sofas, on TV things don't ever

And I don't wanna go to your funeral, I'd rather die first
But I don't want you to see me die so I don't know which one is worse
It's like the lesser of two evils, I know these days are evil
So I pray the Lord will guard me from the evil one, he's schemin'
I've seen friends turn their back on the Lord
It weighs heavy on my shoulders, yet I know the story isn't over
So I'm hoping for the best and keeping my mind sober
When my phone rings, I hear the voice of somebody that's broken
And I wanna say I told ya, now it's too late to listen
Running in circles with friends who struggle with addiction
Caught in a spider's web, this life is but a vapor
And lust is like a viper waiting in the grass to strike ya
I was called to give my life instead of keep it
Gotta leave behind my sin if I wanna follow Jesus
In our weakness is where the Gospel meets us
The beauty of redemption revealed in our broken pieces


Shadows cross right over me, right through me
And my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly
But you go to the bedrock of my inmost being
Sowing seeds of gratefulness you see me


God is my rest, but lately I'm losing sleep
The Good Shepherd never loses track of his sheep
That's a good thought to ponder when I see so many wander
Off road, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When I'm overwhelmed, I know I'm in over my head
Fighting with myself but my opponent is dead
How can we win the battle when we burn deeply within?
Jesus laid down His rights, I can lay down my sin
If He is Lord, all that competes with him loses
Only He completes me and cuts through the confusion
Of my wants and my needs, my desires and my dreams
His love inspires me to lift my thoughts to higher things
I was called to give my life instead of keep it
There's nothing worth keeping if it's keeping us from Jesus
In our weakness is where the Gospel meets us
The beauty of redemption revealed in broken pieces


Shadows cross right over me, right through me
And my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly
But you go to the bedrock of my inmost being
Sowing seeds of gratefulness you see me
Shadows cross right over me, right through me
And my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly
But you go to the bedrock of my inmost being
Sowing seeds of gratefulness despite my feelings

When I reminisce, ignorance was bliss
Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was, 'cause the way it
Was just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun livin' life on the run
Never had chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle, so figure it out
Always thinkin' that you know every little thing there is to know
But you don't really know, you know?
It's like love, some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me it's just a pain in the ass
But I'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last

Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world

I learned to forgive 'em, now I got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my Gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still I never want it all, and I never want it now
I just wanna cruise, if I lose, then I'll figure it out
How the times files, even with the blink of an eye
When you're young, you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's was amazing what you learn when you've never been taught, you know?

Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world

No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world

Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared

But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history

Well, Cassie O'Grady was no Southern lady
Despite all the media hype
They all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout

It's just a Choctaw County affair 
And now they say she's lying dead somewhere 


Well, I do not deny, I wished Cassie would die
When she threatened us with blackmail
She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail
Now it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper
Like a buck-shot grizzly bear


But there's no body, there's no witness

We would live or die, hand in hand

Said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha

Screaming ""please come help me
That Canadian shaman gave a little too much to me!""
And I'm writing a novel
Because it's never been done before
First house that I saw, I wrote house up on the door
And told the people who lived there they had to get out
""'Cause my reality is realer than yours""
And there's no time in the present
And there's a black dog on the bed
I went to the backyard to burn my only clothes
And the dog ran out and said, ""You can't turn nothing
Into nothingness with me no more""

And if he is, I'll be walking him my whole life

He said, ""You're gonna have to drown me down on the beach
If you ever want to write the real""

Baby, this Christmas
I can't afford too many things
I don't have a dollar, fancy shoes, or diamonds rings
Who needs a shopping spree?
The best things in life are free


Just wrap me up under the Christmas tree


Pretty baby
There may not be presents piled high upon the floor
I got something special that you can't find at any store
You won't need a warranty
That I can guarantee


Just wrap me up under the Christmas tree


Well, Santa may not come tonight
It's alright
It's gonna be a merry Christmas
It's gonna be a merry Christmas
If you see those reindeer flying by
Don't cry
It's gonna be a merry Christmas
It's gonna be a merry Christmas

I know you were wishing for that trip to Paris, France
Have wine on the river, a little fairy tale romance
But we got each other and there's nothing more we need
This cosy apartment, and some real good food to eat
This year, just stay home with me
And I'll love you endlessly

He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
Started making his way past 2 in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days
Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs


Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in


Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me


And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

The neighbors said she moved away
Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be


I'm not coming back 
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak 
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just 
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head


Well I guess I'll go home now

As children draped in flowers form a chain
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls
As night falls into dust and it's day again


I'm not afraid of a love parade in my daydream
Old men with kazoos and beating drums
But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream
It's just you and me and oh dear, our life has just begun


Everything is beautiful here
It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading


Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile
We could close the door and sleep all day
It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind

Always got a plan
Coping out problems
Every time I can
Like to be known as a great communicator
If you got beef don’t save it for later

I’m mister logic
What’s in my mind
Let’s not dodge it
Keeping it cruel cause I am able
Able to be stable

I am a manicured swinger
Known to talk shit
I really can’t remember
But somebody got hit
Even as I do it
I know I do it wrong
I bet I could control it
But the urge is so strong

I battle evil weekly, monthly, yearly
But every step I take
The devil stays near me
There’s a voice in my head that takes control
What I said about being stable
It’s all bull

I am a nervous wreck
I can’t sit still
Always on the verge of mentally ill
Nine times out of ten
Can’t sleep past sunrise
Trying all night
Close my eyes

I got news for you
It ain’t nothing nice
We all got demons
We all got a vice
The struggle never ends
To keep it in check
But I’ll never stop trying
To make the trek

Realy tho, I just came to tell you don't be scurred
Preach the word everywhere you go and let the truth be heard
And you ain't gotta be a rapper but you gotta tell the truth
Scream it from your mama house or from your project ..
Chi-town to the Lou, Memphis Ten to the ..
Dallas, Houston, Indiana, Oklahoma need it too

Put our sin upon His shoulders told us tell somebody else
Now we die to ourselves, stop lying to ourselves
Ain't ashamed to share the gospel, put our pride on the shelf
We don't ride for the wealth but we ride for change
In the heart and not the pocket man to die is to gain


State to state, city to city
Block to block and hood to hood
Catch us outside everywhere we go
Trying to tell these folks what's good
The good news, some call it the gospel
Some folks embrace it, others get hostile
But earth is cursed man, heaven is perfect
If we can clown for Christ man believe me it's worth it

Worthless, without our God's plan is the purpose

Get it crunk, but keep it steady now
In it to win it now, man they done did it now
Spit it for the cats ..
When the goal is Christ, then live it out


What it do, let me bring up Romans 1:16
It's more than the clique I claim, it's the reason I'm redeemed
 Ain't ashamed of the gospel of Christ
It's the power that crossed our souls out of death into light
Holla 1-1-6, cause we once was sick
Christ bought us even though we wasn't worth one cent
Yea the curse was sin but the earth got sent
A Redeemer Who paid for all of the earth's worse sin
Now the worse per-son can repent and be changed
That's why we never ashamed of the truth we proclaim
It's the light on the dark path, only way out of death
It's the answer to every question people got on their chest
People gotta address the crucial nature of sin
What that got to do with us man?
We tell them Christ is where they begin

From your knees, you're coated brown, to your toes
There is no sound like this

And I will keep you warm in hell
And I will keep you warm in hell
Way down in hell

Walt Grace
Desperately hating his whole place
Dreamed to discover a new space
And buried himself alive

Inside his basement
Tongue on the side of his face meant
He's working away on displacement
And what it would take to survive


Because when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he'd try


But with the will to work hard
And a library card
He took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride


That morning
The sea was mad and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home

From dry land
He rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And peddled off alone


Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide


And the sky was a flare
As he came up for air
In his homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride


One evening
When weeks had passed since he's leaving
The call she planned on receiving
Finally made it home

She accepted
The news she never expected
The operator connected
The call from Tokyo


Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side


And they smile when they can
As they speak of the man
Who took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now


Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge on
Balancing on a ledge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know


The evil that men do lives on and on



Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn


Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know







The evil, the evil
The evil that men do
The evil, the evil

Stumbled upon a pack of someone's cigarettes
In the backseat of your Honda
You can say whatever you wanna
That doesn't mean that I will think you're innocent

Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away


So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!

Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you

Motherfuck the police, smokin' on some OG
Go in, ridin' dole, I ain't fuckin' playin'
Nah, niggas want no beef, pull up with the slow creep
Leave that ass holey, I ain't fuckin' playin' 
Pull up in the coupe, shorty grabbin' on my root 
Found my inner peace just from smokin' all this Buddha 
Know that crime pays, so my nigga I salute ya
Me? I'm gettin' paid just by usin' my medulla 


Niggas talk fluent, 'til I put a dart through 'em 
In the dark, chew 'em, make me bring the sharks to 'em 
Shooter splattin' paint like a fuckin' art room 
Leave one 21, now he ain't got no heart to him 
They might run their mouth, but they ain't got the balls to do it
I go hard up in the paint, Olajuwon be my influence
Flag be on the left and you know that shit be the bluest
If a hater disrespect, I leave that pussy leakin' fluids
Focus on the next, don't got no time to sit, reflect 
Always steps ahead, my life is like a game of chess 
Who that, war and test, put him soul straight to rest
Know some Haitians with that voodoo
Know Jamaicans with the checks 
Go against the vets like I'm an animal, upset
Make 'em vanish out their flesh, put my manners to the test
I'm the illest on the planet, tell the doctor I confess
Rocket launcher through your vest, fuck the drama, we the best
In designer, I'm enlightened but with commas in my cheque
Perfect timin', I'm a titan, watch me rule the earth again
I be too determined to be swervin' out my lane for trends
I just found a way to cleanse, Sage, that's my lady friend
And she do just what I say as long as I can pay the rent
I been ballin' so hard lately, feel like I can play Durant
Though I love my mama dearly, sometimes she can save them rants
Put Versace on my frames, I call the shit my hater lens 
Saint Laurent the kicks, Amiri Jeans mixed with the Kenzo
On my owner shit but got your girlfriend as a rental
She be on my dick, she say I'm fresher than a Mentos
I only get the mental if menstrual 
They know the realest but if not the flow reveal it
Smokin' broccoli like my nigga, free young Kodak, 'bout my skrilla
Got gorillas in my village, Bathing Apes is all I deal with
But somehow a nigga livin', had to sacrifice to get it

Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed


Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying


All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been


Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir


Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down

Then get down with these around. The hulks in your throat

Shorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off, just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round, stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight, I know what you like, I know just how to break you off


Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away, we be starting a family
It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl, you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now, that's the first half of my act
I started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks
 Yeah, it's like that




Now you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosions, Trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test, girl, I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusting seductions considered an art
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank ya for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer, my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop
Forget that grip, that ride it nonstop

"It's Friday night
And the football game starts around 7:30
I shower up and put on my boots
Even though they're a little dirty
Pick up my baby at around 6:10
For a little pre-game fun
Buzzer sounds at the end of 4th quarter
And away we run

To that spot down by the river
Where worries ain't got no place to hang around
There'll be skinny dippin' & moon shine sippin'
And everybody's partyin'
Down at that spot down by the river

It's Sunday mornin'
And we just left church
And we're lookin' for something to do
I said, ""I heard those bass were runnin'""
Let's see if it's true
Me and Nate grab a couple of poles
And we call up the girls on the phone
Said get up out of that Sunday dress
Your mama won't know you're gone

To that spot down by the river
Where worries ain't got no place to hang around
There'll be skinny dippin, and moon shine sippin'
And everybody's partying
Down at that spot down by the river

Well there's true love growin' straight off the vine
And a brand new bottle of sweet red wine
Try real hard for maybe just one kiss

At that spot down by the river
Where worries ain't got no place to hang around
There'll be skinny dippin, and moon shine sippin

"Intro:
Yeah, 116. 13 Letters. What we gon' do right now is take a brief look at the letter that Paul wrote to the Philippians, take a look at what he said to 'em, and how we can apply it to our own lives. Let's get it. Yes, yes, yes!

Verse 1:
Brethren listen to this exposition
Paul wrote the Philippians some lessons for living 
Written to them but it's real good text for Christians
Read it closely, hope we can catch the vision
Chapter 1: he tells them he's blessed to get them
Co-laboring with him to serve the best who's risen 
And he's confident the Lord will perfect in Christians
What He started and hearts'll be corrected in them 
Listen, he was in prison now maybe never getting out
But all he could think about was the gospel getting out 
Some was even preaching Christ for selfish motives
Coming at Paul but dawg he shrugged his shoulders 
His focus was Christ the Messiah, man 
And for Him ""to live is Christ and to die was gain"" 
Yeah, he was hard-pressed, but to remain in the flesh
Was more necessary so their faith would progress 
He wanted them to strive together for the gospel
In one spirit, one mind, listen to the apostle 
Maintain the same love, uplift your brothers
Don't just look out for yourself, but for the interests of others 

Chorus:
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 

Verse 2:
Chapter 2: Let's examine five through eleven
The blessed Lamb who resided in the Heavens 
Said, ""Forget the wealth,"" and emptied Himself
Came as a man and he died for the brethren 
Ultimate obedience, he died on the cross and 
Through His humility, Christ was exalted 
Glory to the Father , now we should have
That same attitude Christ Jesus had 
And on to verse twelve work out your salvation 
The Father works in us in this process of saving 
Avoid dispute and prove yourself blameless
Children of God in a perverse generation 
Cling to the Bible, humility is vital
We see it in the lives of Paul and his disciples 
Serving him like a father , some fellow soldiers 
Let us rejoice, unite, and rep Jehovah

Chorus:
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 

Verse 3:
Chapter 3: Rejoice in the Lord we serve 
And forget about the flesh; we nothing more than dirt 
Man, if anyone could brag bout they status it was Paul
But to him it was trash it and he counted it as loss
For the sake of the Christ, 'cause He gave us life 
Not through anything we did but through faith in Christ 
We righteous in the eyes of the Lord that's blessing
Conformed to His death and His resurrection 
Brethren, I don't claim to have attained perfection's
What he said but was reaching to what lies ahead 
And encouraged the Philippians to model what he said 
And not to walk in the flesh cause that walk is dead 
But we citizens of Heaven who eagerly wait for
The one that we rest in Jesus our Savior 
That's who the Lord is and He will surely
Transform our bodies in future glory 

Chorus:
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 

Verse 4:
Chapter 4: He closes encouraging with words
In unity and harmony for those within the church 
Rejoice in the Lord, bro our hope's in Him first 
Let our thanks and our problems be known to Him first 
Embrace the peace of God, you can bet on that 
And whatever is good let your mind dwell on that 
Then he thanked them again, for their gifts and concern 
But no matter what to be content he had learned 
Plus he was sure that he could do all things
Through Him who gave strength and can do all things 
And he told them they did well sharing through all pain 
And made sure they knew he sure he wasn't trying to get more change 
God will supply all their needs he hoped they might see this
According to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus 
The truth of Philippians I hope it hit you
And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you 
I hope you like what you heard with me rapping these verses
But don't get it twisted, we just scratching the surface
There's more to be learned than this rap is saying
So read it, live it, learn it like the back of your hand

Chorus:
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call 
Our life is nothing, but Christ is all 
So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call

You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release, and you're so cold
Are you crazy?
You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
'Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop


'Cause we were a match in heaven, high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight


Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothin' from you

Still driving these bitches crazy
Forever got a due to the fact that the streets made me
She asked can she hit the weed, I said ""That's ok with me""
But I'm still screaming ""Fuk u pay me""
Fuk u pay me 
I ain't be feeling like doing shit but counting paper lately
All of my bitches be wanting to have threesomes lately


I'm in the back of the back when I back out
Wrapped like a man inside of a crack house
Everybody know I'm a fashionista
Trap jumping up like Stackhouse
Everybody know what that's about
Swag up to my forehead, Miami from a  day
Drinking lean on a moped
Inner shake down for some romance
Look me in the eyes like a grown man
Seen a girl from high school
Busting moves on a pole dance
Southside Atlanta shit
Might boss the world with some counterfeits
Tell a nigga it's sold out, killed the game #PaulBearer
I ain't packing for some more there
Long money, long hair
Long nose, leave you long gone
Stretch you out like a lawn chair
Fuk u pay me, kick your shit like Solange there
Comfortable like Hermès, drive a ho crazy #AirBags




You owe me mula, where's my guala ?
You ain't got it ? We got problems
Got to send my partner them shotters
I mean them shooters
In the club ordering bottles, strictly for the models
Throw a band's worth of Versace, get on one side on my closet
Fuck the shit out of little mama and drive her Looney Tunes
Play with me, I'll introduce you to the Gooney Tunes
These niggas trash, sweep them up, I need a broom
The bitch's nigga she ditched on us and then met me out the room
Showed up in that trench coat, caught butt naked like Robin Givens
Sexy pretty ass ghetto bitch straight from out Memphis
Scream out that droptop : ""Fuk u pay me""
You better keep that Glock out, boy you know these streets shaded
Where the fuck you've been lately ?

Thanks for throwing me on TV
As a result my story's neater
And my swag is off the meter

Why you gotta copy me
And pretending that you're always something new
Bitch you Microsoft
Stealing from Macintosh
I ain't Adele
I ain't Someone Like You
S-someone like you
Always smells
And you smell like a glove
I'm the cleanest motherfucker on the block

And I'm moving your feet
Head-shoulders and your shoulders and your toes
There's a lot of love in life
And you gotta get it right
So here's something that you probably know:


I like girls, girls

Hope you feel the same
Hey, call my name
Make you go insane
Come, choose my aim
I was making brain
Kids will call me lame
Cause I'm failing tests

You don't know what prep school is like
Just like I never won a fight
Just because you know me
Doesn't mean that you're my homie
Thinking you can get above me
But I fucked you right and sorry
Just in case you have yet to hear
I am the rapper that you fear
I don't know cause I'm not broke
Put some clothes and money first
Let you listen while you work
Drop a dollar go berserk


Yeah
Drop it drop it drop it low
Drop it drop it drop it low
Drop it drop it drop it low

I bet the women always wonder how I keep a man
They been trying for so long, and still don't understand
It's not the things I say, it's the way I say it
That keeps them locked down, nowhere to go
And on top of that, I let him know


I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You never have to worry 'bout a thing, I gotcha' back
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
'Cause it feels real good
When you know somebody's got ya' back


I'm the type when I find a man I like
It's on and poppin', ain't no stoppin', the things I do for you
No complications, baby keep it real
Do unto to me, as I do, and everything will be cool
When you find yourself in times of trouble
Remember that I'm by your side 
Lean on me, when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on


I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You never have to worry 'bout a thing, I gotcha' back
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
Because it feels real good
When you know somebody's gotcha' back

Coloring my senses cherry red; at least for this week...
Kisses under starry night skies, talked about in song
We play along, so bitter sweet by our design
I'm sick and tired of writing songs about you
This is it, this is the end

Choke on the drama that makes me want to
Tear up the pictures, the pages you've saved
Creating a life of trends and make believe

In this endeavor, make this last forever
I'm just delirious

You can't be serious

You're so infamous for leaving me a mess


Take off your makeup and put down the camera
Choke on the drama that makes me want to

Get out while you can or she'll tear you to pieces

Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around


Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen the mac aiming at your head, mane?
Before you know it life is flashing, reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead, mane
I done been there, I done copped that
It ain't never been a question, I'm bout that
Don't go there, you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that
You'll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
Cause I be long gone like The Ripper so


Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

Life is degrading and silently making me
Spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death


I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down


So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside


Humiliating, I fall to its craving
It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading, our feelings I'm saving
To fix what I tore all apart


I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down


So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside


I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me

Take the pain inside

And puts her down over there

Philly drinks, and when he drinks, all the drunks hit the floor
Philly sinks, and when he sinks you go down
And when you do, you both drown

Congratulations, you hit the mark
You got the bird on the wing

Philly sinks, but now the glass is a girl
But now the girl is a frown

Well, you can put in your oar

And if the rowing gets dull
Just knock a hole in the hull
And let the ocean swallow you down

Life in a city living in L.A
Is a long way from Huddersfield town
The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven
But that's where he get's his pork pie
Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy
Rugby and cricket's unknown
Baseball and football they're making him lazy
Your fan club says ""Rodney come home""


The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels

A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The Nautilus rusts in the yard
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning
He'll always live in L.A
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker
And he always cheats when he deals



Hello, let me introduce meself!
My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong
When I were a lad, I could lift up five
Navies on an end of a shovel
The reason I never took martial arts because
I was immensely fearsome and
I'd probably kill everybody
I came into contact with it
I was phenomenally strong
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego
Is what makes the world rotate
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield
But I don't live there anymore
I live in Los Angeles
It's great!... I think

Rufus the red has a crane by his bed
To wrench himself up in the morn'
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
You'll wish you'd never been born
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead
He slumbers for most of the day
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast
Your problem Rodney L.A

The person you're tryna reach is unavailable, ayy 
Remember the days? When me and $lick had to drive to LA?
Sleepin' on the floor at Krez and Fat Nick's house
A hoodie doubles as a pillow
And you're blessed to get a couch 
Ask for no amount, 'till it's time to really count
Whatever the fuck you say you hate is what the fuck I'm really 'bout
Really doin' drugs, unlike you, do it for the clout 
Really got a problem, like I'm usually blacking out 
All my friends are headcases, and this kid's gonna pout
Bring me back to the pizza kitchen, I'll clock in and out
Washin' dishes, customers bitching, the manager trippin'
Still, I'm out 
Fuck the rap industry, I'm down for the motherfucking count
All you fuckin' clowns, I could really do without, ayy
I'll be back, I really, really, really doubt


Southside maniac with the nine loaded 
Northside Shawty, AKA I'm loaded 
Made a couple milli', world touring
Fucking it up—but fuck a couple milli'
Burn it up, like I'm the Joker in Gotham City
Before them days, we used to hit up Orange Mound 
TA, Ghost, Smurf, brought the skunk out 
Ridin' four deep
Smoked out, loced out
Smoked out, loced out 
Now I'm surrounded by folks I never met
Seems like the bigger you get, equals nothing but death
But nonetheless, still got them dead presidents
Innocent residents, stray bullets, deaths begin
Funerals for the cold-blooded, makeup skin 
So I call Ruby, he said he got the blade 
I'm like, ""Okay, I got the jacket loaded, and the AK""
And the AK, AK...


Fuck you!
All of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake
When I die, bury me in all grey
All of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake
$uicide, 'till the motherfucking grave
All of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake
When I die, bury me in all grey
All of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake
It's $uicide, 'till the motherfucking grave

Polizia e malviventi
Sono tutti di una razza

O banditi per le strade
O arruolati in polizia!

Non ti rimane
Che andare in polizia
O come alternativa
Una rapina a una gioielleria
Di tutti i tuoi fratelli
Sei l'unico che ha studiato
Il grande è già a Torino
E in polizia si è già arruolato!

Mentre scappavi
Un poliziotto ti ha sparato
Una raffica di mitra
E sei rimasto a terra fulminato
Con una calza nera
Ha il viso incappucciato
Ma sotto il volto vero
Di tutto il sud emarginato!

"Riding on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sitting in leather, riding on steel

Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again
No, he won't

And I got sent to 'Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job

Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight

My social workers got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name
Yes, it does, and he likes it

Unemployment checks run out next week
It won't be very long till I'm back
On the streets again

Now, now you were sitting home
And I got sent to 'Nam

This assertion came so swiftly
Cut the cord from
This day forward
We'll be drifting
No direction
No affection
Watch the soul dive
You're dissected
Resurrected
Still don't know why
This illness is like a monster that is
Eating us alive


Hold on! Be strong!
So right! So wrong!
With all of our senses!
All of our defenses!
Hold on! Be strong!


New arrival
Our survival
Still not certain
Once a virtue
Where to go to
When you're hurting
It's a weakness
It's a sickness
In the gene pool
Show no mercy
People here say
Kill the damn fool
This illness is
Like a monster that is
Eating us alive

Lately all this music sound the same
I can't even see You in my lane
If you ain't talking growth then you can sit
I grew up in the stu I had to spit
I barely had the chance to watch some Nick
So all this mediocre ion get
God told me I gotta level up
I can't be his son sounding regular
I ain't get cozy off a lil buzz
Always getting better what a legend does
You ion know where we came from
If you got a beat I was on it
All them late nights working
You was prolly watching Conan
I'm on the other side now I looked up to all these dudes when I was young
Fighting off all these demons like I'm like I'm Jackie Chan
Being great is what I'm gonna do
Old labels salty cause I'm making moves
These people talking got me in a mood
But God to good too even sweat the fools


This year is all mine it's go time
Spittin facts
Got a lot of people plotting me to fail

Compared to God I'm overrated like James Harden
They all selling out for bread homie that's baloney
I had to move away from that like a alimony
We making moves
I'm in a groove
Can't be in my biz
Unless I approve prove prove
She ain't wit you for the reasons that you think she do
Lying to my face that's a bad bad move
I gotta make it count got no time for wishing
I ain't with the candy girls I need a new edition
Don't mind me I'm just spitting facts
I got my lil sisters on my back
We coming in for a rude attack
I'm in a golden state BOI my team is stacked

Everyday I wake up it's a blessing that facts
Took my L turned it to a lesson that's facts
Might be in the back but I'm chosen that's facts
Friends wanna bounce when you growning that's facts
Imma be that guy that they sleep on until I die
Because I always speak the truth and can't rap you all these lies
And I can't fake in front of crowds and be a different guy behind
Like all your favorite rappers no more hiding in disguise
If I never get to chill with the cool guys in the industry
And I don't ever got all the famous people following and tweeting me
I don't care about a cliche long as God and my fam here wit me
I'm content proclaiming Jesus living my dream no matter if you feeling me

Why you look like that? 
He look crazy as hell
But he dress well 
Why his face look puff?
Why he look like that? 
Why your hair like that? 
Why your teeth like that? 
Why your cheeks like that?


I got this shitty moustache, and a new haircut
Short but tall enough to ride every ride so it's fair enough
Teeth crooked but my breath fresh just like the evergreens
My attitude is bit like, a psys- fuck!
You mean a psychopath
I bet the marble feel good on your bare foot
I'm in the backyard hiding out like I'm Bigfoot
And I won't cater to you
Yeah I am not Carrabba's, and I ain't taking orders
Here for the loot, and to inspire some of you
To do what you do despite all the ""fuck you's""
'Cause they shit on your shit, stab you right in the back
'Til you're shittin' on the toilet with Grammys in your lap


Niggas talk a lot of shit, in a safe place
Aiming with they keyboard, they shootin' uppercase
I'm booking tour dates, money in the suitcase
Commander and the chief like, Barack Hussein
Same nigga, two names, I am onto new things
Flying out of Houston, lemme say a few things
I don't give a fuck about you or your screen name
I'ma be a star even if I say the same things
'Cause them same things keep me on the wavelengths
I dropped another verse, so you gon' have to pay me
Glock with no safety, seen niggas on the pavement
Over gang affiliations, guns with extensions
Seeing niggas get anxious, all these internet gangstas
I'm running outta patience, nigga, stick to your day shift
And watch what you're saying, and please keep praying
'Cause niggas talk big 'til that price on their head


I feel the voices always drown out all the noise in the room
They don't employ you for your purpose, they just need a platoon
Another number in a line ready to march into tombs
I ain't the one to assume, I put the coon in tycoon
We colonizing the moon, I see you look to the sky
And start to wish it was you, sometimes I wish I was me
Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife
I ain't afraid of the heights, they all afraid to appall
I'm just afraid of excitement being a trip to the mall
I need a summer to fall, I need a winter to spring
Got all these seasons within me, building a story to sing
Don't need a dollar to dream, I need a billion in facts
I need a trillion in wealth, y'all niggas need to relax
I wanna build up the culture, they wanna dream in the trap
I took the zoom off my lens and I saw the world in my lap


I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag

Rambling out of the wild West
Leaving the towns I love the best
Thought I’d seen some ups and downs
'til I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Buildings going up to the sky


Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn’t feel so cold then


I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village


I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffee-houses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, “Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here”


Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved them sound
He was raving about how he loved them sound
Dollar a day’s worth


And after weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid my dues


Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didn’t take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin’ about
A lot of people don’t have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
And they got to cut something


So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long, New York

Checircondo di buio quel famoso pomeriggio
Il freddo penetrava fino dentro le calzette
Mentre perdevo lamia vista dentro a un piccolo ingranaggio

Dai vetri l'ombra di in 78 giri bussa alla mia porta
Dicendo d'essere l'ultimo gigante ormai in estinzione
E zoppicando col passo da vecchio rotolo nella mia stanza
E si sdraio su un giradischi spento... spento

Se vuoi sapere latua storia accendi e fammi girare... girare
Mi disse il vecchio 78 con aria sufficiente
E scoprirai che in fondo alle mie valli c'e tutta la tua forza
Io sono quello che tu sei sempre stato dal giorno che sei nato
E col mio orologio matto io posso anche fermare il tempo... tempo
Se calerai, sopra di me, quel diamante...

Mentre tutti gli ingranaggi eran fermi ad ascoltare
Questa musica esplosiva che portava un'aria nuova

Ma ad un tratto gli orologi poi ripresero ad andare
E comincio a camminare anche quello che prima non andava
Dalla finestra uno strano chiarore illuminava la stanza
E nel guardare la neve che scendeva io mi ricordai
Che proprio quel giorno
Era il giorno del mio... compleano

E una musica esplosiva mi scoppio dentro nel cuore

You can leave and leave my heart alone


Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it


Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?

Don't be mean, if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you


Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

I follow you everywhere you go, baby
The pain as light has come to wake you

That I inspire the dreams that guide you baby
I follow the winds that bring the cold, baby
I light a fire in your soul, baby
The lightest touch of feathers falling
My love might be invisible
But I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby
You're a half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
Your satellite
Your singing satellite

You're a half a world away
I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that God sends
I'm flying high on my red eye
And winding down the windows
My future is a valentine
Stolen in the perfect crime
And I know I'm living out of line
But with a blazing smile I'll die

I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in


I'm a truth carrier, barbarian
Hands to the plow how they bury me no fear in me
Years ago, I be up in a dim lit hole screaming, Woah!
As the reefer blow and the liquor pour
On a line of white unafraid to fight stand proud
For a crowd of the devil's children talking loud
Then Pow! the Spirit gave birth to a child
Now you don't know me and you don't know my style
Courageous as I make the sacrifice live selfless
Follow Christ through the dark valley where the death is
Reject sin kill the lion stomp around Jericho
Ram's horn blow, serpent's head crush death blow



I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in


They want me under that system hunting that
Good life, hood life just like all them other cats
They want me scared man I'm gonna snap
They want me following a lot of them but I ain't hearing of none of that
Running back, look I ain't gotta follow fools
And I ain't gotta follow crews that don't like to follow rules
Ain't gotta try to follow all them hundred dollar dudes
Naw, bruh that ain't my motto and I know I gotta choose
They tell me to rebel and well I ain't enthused
By opposing my creator cause I know that I would lose
Just cause I'm a dude don't mean I need Glocks
I think they got the flu cause they think they need shots
We stop tryna chase them we much rather know Him
We can't see the sun  then a storm finna blow in
We tryna be courageous, let His word soak in
We got that free admission we bout to go in


I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in


All creation will be shaken and hearts will be racing
They'll be waiting for the judge and His opening statement
They show courage in the wrong ways
Before I move to Atlanta I knew some real braves
These cowards run the world, I guess they legs are tired
So now they sit in the throne that the Lord desired
We trust in our hero that's how we know we're saved
Yeah, He even gives us strength on our weak days
It's a zoo out there, cheetahs driving Jaguars
And most rappers are animals, lyin' in bars
They claim they run the game, they got that money mayne
But my value's eternal I got forever change
I tried not to judge I was defended once
Until I got booked and saw what the sentence was
I find courage in the Spirit in our God alone
I'm not scared of Mick Jagger's rolling with stones


I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in

And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out

And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin' crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm losin' hope, they got me stressin', can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennessey got me queasy
Don't wanna hurl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
Slangin' rocks with your Glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin from the cops—and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows

I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
And every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin' over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
Take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin' niggas, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breathe
Got me thinking, what do Hell got?
Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin' shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin' game
And Lord knows

One-time! One-time!
Fuck the 5-0 cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let 'em capture me
Done lost too many niggas to this gangbangin'
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin', fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man

Try to calm me down, I ain't givin' up

Little over sweet sixteen
But the cutest flapper that you've ever seen

She will always wink her eye
When she talks to them
When she walks with them
This is what they'll cry

Does she know that I'm about to steal you?
Oh my when I look in your eyes
Something tells me you and I should get together

How bout a little kiss Cecilia
Just a kiss you'll never miss Cecilia
Why do we two keep on wasting time?

"My time couldn't see it coming
But I lost my senses it was falling away
Couldn't leave in the middle of the night
Took the dawn to the day and the day to the night
Every single day that I've done my time
Raising every doubt that is in my mind
My crime I rhyme
And everybody's set aside I take it down
And you know that you can't face me
Got to face that you cannot help me
I can feel every day that I'm lost in a dream

I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity
I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I'm going to ignite what is in my mind
And I am sincere
Won't give in to my fears
I don't want to be
Lost in a dream

I fly I'm high when you get low
But I know it's a chance we can redo what's already done
I can fix you I wanna make you strong
But somehow I've known you long
I have no doubt a needle in the eye
I want to change and I know what's right
Cross the waters
Crossing the line
Cross the borders
I know what it's like
And I know that you won't fear me
But I fear that you cannot help me
And I know every day that I'm lost in a dream

I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity
I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I'm going to ignite what is in my mind
And I am sincere
Won't give in to my fears
I don't want to be
Lost in a dream

Let the inside of me
And guide your way
Let it out of me, out of me
Need serenity
To make you see
My dream



I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity
I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity
I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I'm going to ignite what is in my mind

Won't give in to my fears
I don't want to be

Do you remember the taste of my lips that night
I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?
'Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall
That separated the dining room
And I remember the fear in your eyes
The very first time we snuck into the city pool
Late December, with my heart in my chest
And the clouds of my breath
Didn't know where we were running to
But don't look back


Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday


Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens?
'Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
I imagine the tears in your eyes
The very first night I'll sleep without you
And when it happens I'll be miles away
And a few months late
Didn't know where I was running to
But I won't look back


Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
So for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday


Feet first, don't fall
Or we'll be running again
Keep close, stand tall


Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away

Can I blame it on you?
I just can't win

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
Can't seem to find a good excuse this time, for me and for this to fall apart
Shall I blame it on myself, or this routine that I've been stuck in?


I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine
But it's holding so fucking tight


I can't handle another day of this
I just can't win
I just can't win

Get me out alive


Oh God, I mean it
These are violent days for you and I
I just, I just can't handle another day of this routine
I just can't win, I just can't win
Get me out alive


Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
I've found my excuse this time
Your words are wearing me down
A constant frown upon my back


I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine
But it's holding so fucking tight

So fucking tight

Drain the lake and bring it back to me

Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?


I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore


There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying



Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise


There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying...

"Fly silly seabird
No dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you
For sun on your wings
My gentle relations
Have names they must call me
For loving the freedom
Of all flying things
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

I came to the city
And lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise
In a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete
And the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false
On their store window trees
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

Out of the city
And down to the seaside
To sun on my shoulders
And wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble
And hunger is human
And humans are hungry
For worlds they can't share
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach
Out of cry

I call to a seagull
Who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine
Dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints
That danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes
That sunk like a stone
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach
Out of cry

Boots were of leather
A breath of cologne
Her mirror was a window
She sat quite alone

All around her
The garden grew
Scarlet and purple
And crimson and blue

She came and she went
And at last went away
The garden was sealed
When the flowers decayed

On the wall of the garden
A legend did say:
No one may come here
Since no one may stay

With weapons drawn we claim the future
And then seep out through every storm
Bring in the foe to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk till dawn


Firepower
Petrifies
Firepower


The die is cast, make no exceptions
We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally round this lack of freedom
Our unions rise so go to hell


Firepower
Taking lives
Firepower
Neutralize


Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives of danger
It's bound to explode


Aim for the target
With laser and lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight
No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace


We fight this firepower

Between the eyes
Firepower
Mortifies

"Myself

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give into sad thoughts that are maddening?

Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch 'em red handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?

Because I can't hold when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again, by myself

Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

I can't look around

I can't hold back


I can't slow down

I can't look back


If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on, then theyll
Take from me 'til everything is gone

If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch 'em I'll be, outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer, by myself

Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

I can't look around

I can't hold back
When I'm stretched so thin

I can't slow down
Watching everything spin
I can't look back
Starting over again

Don't you
Don't you

Know, I can't tell you how to make it

Try, I can't seem to convince myself

To be such a freak
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone

And you know something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
Who keep you supplied with facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations



You've been with the professors
And they all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known

And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

The sword swallower comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
Without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""

And you know something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You see this one-eyed midget
And he's shouting the word ""NOW""
You say, ""What's the matter?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back, ""You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home""

And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
Your eyes in your pockets
And your head on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

And you know something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Learned to shoot a gun, before I learned to read or write
Never touched a pipe, made my money every night
'Til I gotta , a motherfuckin' Benz 
Bitch talked to every snitch, they jeopardized me gettin' rich
Only fifteen at a spot full of rock teens
Full of hard knocks, ready to clock, fuck the cops 
And we was fat like Trump
Every nigga packed a pump, so time to be poppin' trunks
I stood at the top of the organization
Ready to pop a cop with no hesitations  yeah
Now I'm makin' all the others run
Cause here it comes, look out for brother troublesome


Yeah y'all, hehe
A nigga named Troublesome


I learned from my mistakes I'm twenty-one now
I gotta pack of jackers out for me they hold a gun battle
Ain't old enough to save but I behave just like a true vet
That's cause for all the dirt I did and dirt I didn't do yet
Tryin' to pop my pistol for a profit
Copper tried to stop I didn't drop and so we got it 
And I don't give a fuck about it
 I doubt it
So why not take all of me
Cause I just love to be the nigga that nobody else has the balls to be
These suckers always searchin' for me, with funk
They in a hurry to get buried with they loc's up 
And once I let my gun pop
Another motherfucker drops
I smoke a gang of buddha better yet some indo
Crack through your window, nigga where the fuck the ya-yo?
You tried to hesitate I couldn't wait to rush him

I ain't no fuckin' joke so you can label me King of Oakland, huh
As I sit back and rake my, dough in
I let my money grown in just got rich off what they owin', huh
And pimpin' hoes, there's no open
Keepin' a sister broke I'd rather take it from the token 
A psychopath when provoked then
All you see is smoke I pull a pistol from my, coat
I told you we ain't havin' it 
Give up the dough, reached for his coat, started grabbin' it
Bang bang! Was the sound as I jetted
A bullet in the head so the sucker don't forget it
But I knew that I'd be dead soon
Crime in my head, makin' decisions in my bedroom
I see task at my front do' 
But I ain't goin' alive, so what the fuck these niggas come fo'
Just because you got a vest don't mean you escape from death 
I put this AK to your chest it'll take your entire breath
Threw a grenade in the front yard
Six cops lunged then got crunched, here they come God
The other cops are closin' in
Deja vu, what do I do, here we go again 
I'd rather take my life than have these suckers clown me
When they found me, they call me troublesome

Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why

To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see

I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go


So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way

As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box. And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedom

I woke in the mornin', wandering
Weary and worn out
I woke in the morning’, wandering
Weary and worn out
Wishin’ my long-lost lover
Would walk to me, and talk to me
Tell me what it’s all about


I was standin’ at the side road
Listenin’ to the billboard knock
Standin' at the side road
Listenin’ to the billboard knock
Well, my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kickin’
Tickin’ like a clock


Well I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime
Night time, day time
Any time you want


Sometimes I’m thinkin' I’m
Too high to fall
Sometimes I’m thinkin' I’m
Much too high to fall
Other times I’m thinkin' I’m
So low I don’t know
If I can come up at all


Black crows in the meadow
Sleepin' across a broad highway
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway
Though it’s funny, honey
I'm outta' touch, don’t feel much like a
Scarecrow today

"I've got a Pizzaland complexion
Bright green sox
I am the happy little face
On the charity box
But you don't look in my direction
You always look away
You thank the Lord God above
You were not modelled my way

And then I woke up
Right in the middle of a horrible dream
Yes I woke up
I dreamt I was a spastic, but my boots were clean

You are a solid instigator
Of the human code
You held back the traffic
While I crossed the road
But please don't try to be a martyr
The good samaritan play
Because my silly cuban heels
Will give your games away

And then I woke up...
Right in the middle of a horrible dream
Yes I woke up
I dreamt I was a spastic, but my boots were clean

Pray for me 

Then I woke up
Right in the middle of a-

Have you ever had a ride in a light blue car?
Have you ever stopped to think who's the slave and who's the master? 
Have you ever had trouble with your automobile?
Have you ever had to push push push push?

You might have seen them very busy at the weekend 
Licking and polishing the beep-beeps into shape
And then it's proudly up the M1 M2 M3
And keep your feet off the upholstery Ronnie
Cartrouble oh yeah

And remember this:
You don't need anything after an ice cream

I used to sit at home silently and wonder
Why all the preference is polishing the chrome
While all the mothers and the sisters and their babies
Sit and rot at home
Cartrouble oh yeah

I wouldn't like to go
Knowing there is something
Crucial that I owe
No light in my pocket
No trust up my sleeve
A devil is calling
And I take my leave
And take a look at the back of my hand
The last thing you see as it falls away
And try to remember the light on the land
Ending it all…As I do
Every day
Home from work
The sounds are immense
Knowing there is something
That will never make sense
No fun in my wardrobe
No moon in my view
Turn and listen to God
As I turn from you
And take a look at the light on the land
The last thing you see as it falls away
And try to remember the taste of my hand
Ending it all…As I do
Every day
'Cause one day the task
Will be taken over and won
The beginning of ending
Is already done

I met her sometime later
She said, ""I see your eyes are dead

What happened to you, lover?

And since she spoke the truth to me
I tried to answer truthfully
""Whatever happened to my eyes

And there we fell together
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we

You had your dreams 
And I had mine 
Eyes wide open when we dream together
They wanna know how we keep our shit together


Yeah, now wondering
It’s just evolution
We’re just getting better
When the two become one
On a quantum level


It’s nuclear
With you here
There’s nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?

It‘s nuclear
With you here
We both heat up 

Blow it all away 
Blow it all away 
Blow it all away 
Blow it all away 


You had your half
And I had mine 
But now there‘s no such thing as you and me
I was so used to feeling incomplete


Eh, now wondering
It‘s just evolution
We‘re just getting better
When the two become one
On a quantum level

With you here 
There’s nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?


It‘s nuclear 
With you here

Blow it all away



Anytime the climates change between us 
We share a bond and chemistry that can‘t be touched 
So amazing, superpower take over 
We never lose the energy

There’s nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?

You see I been waiting
Waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment…
Is close


Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment


Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin’ syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don’t let ‘em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin’ for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon’ win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon’ get here
Pyrex vison, made more than I ever made with DTP this year


Tired of livin’ day to day like everything is alright
Livin like theres one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
Waiting on my moment
You say you got that OG hell
Next time thats mine
Long as I stay hustlin im gon’ shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment


Just waiting on my moment
Bad hoes im shonin
Time came and I owned it
Just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touch the block I cracked the block
When I pulled up in that ? drop
With that roof off and my shoes off
On you bitch niggas, Real talk
Real nigga in my hood, who errbody gon’ root for
They see my come from that bottom
Where errbody get bout it
They told me get em, I got em
Now im here nigga like yeah nigga
Just rolls royce and Bugattis
And m4 this year nigga
If I dont grind, I dont shine
If I dont shine, then I don’ eat
Won’t eat, then ima starve
If ima starve, I pull heat
On all yall bitch ass niggas
All yall rich azz niggas
Cuz if I don’ make no money nigga
Im gon’ take yo money nigga




Since life ain’t promised..
Live it up live it up live it up
Here before it come this far
Give it up give it up give it up
“I won’t” give it up give it up give up
Until I have it all, YEAH

I get to bustin' like I'm a thirty ought six
When I'm rippin' the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him purty hot
'Cause he knowin' that Tecca Nina's a dirty chopper
He’s handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hoverin' havin' hella go ham though?
I said to Seven, ""Richie Havens'll be the man,"" so
We put it together thinkin' Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, 'cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, ""What we doin'?"" – I said to him, ""Let's chop!""
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another chopper's comin' so let's rock, nigga!
You're on, people got to wonderin' if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer makin' a tour strong
If you thinkin' of battlin'—you're gone!


Nobody can catch him, he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if you got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em, and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I’ve got to audibly body them
This is it, man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain’t ever been a gift for me to heat 'em
I beat 'em, I burn 'em 
They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton, making ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I’m livin' in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast, or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
 I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half-ass deliverin' I'ma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around, so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master, meaning we murderize
We'll bleed 'em, beat 'em 'til they be gone, feed 'em!

Wait! 'Fore I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills
Of ecstasy pills next to me, in the seats spilled
Or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink 
In the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', I dabble in Vics
But I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after tonight
I’m grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it’s like, and attackin' it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pent-up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver
Screwed up my limo, collided with the center divider
I went through the window
And ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy's wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
'Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
You've been yellin' dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate, I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious
Of female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity that I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
To make 'em picket, I pick a day to be a prick
Then I'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level, incredible
Head full of Red Bull, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away? Uh-uh, not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake, eatin' lobster, steak
And coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take, like Kanye walkin' up on the stage
For Beyoncé, like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition replenished, the Punisher
With his gun insured, hundred words
In a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the—

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you trippin' to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's havin' to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we givin' the light, a lot of energy
We reppin', beat checkin' he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Running you down, in front of your town
You ever makin' fun of the clown, I'm gunnin' you down
We doin' it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, no one'll be found, bitch!
Would never be choppin' without Slick Rick
I got it from the record ""Lick the Balls"" and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, 'cause every time I be droppin' I get bit
I'm hearin' a lot of rappers, they tryin' to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em and we kill 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it

Hello Miss Heartbroke
Sit your sweet self down
It's good to see your dancin' feet back out on the town
Rumour has it you've had trouble with your man
I've had trouble of my own, I think I understand


We'll put out your old flame
We'll build a bigger fire
I'll pick up where he let you down and take you so much higher
And if his memory comes around
And you think you still care
We'll burn that bridge when we get there


Come on let your hair down we'll have us a time
He had his chance with you now all I want is mine
Give me half an hour or just a dance or two
And you'll forget old what's his name and how he walked out on you




We'll burn that bridge when we get there
Burn it down baby

"Oh how sadly sound the songs the queen must sing of dying
A prisoner upon her throne of melancholy sighing
If she could see her mirror now
She would be free of those who bow and
Scrape the ground before her feet

Silently she walks among her dying midnight roses
Watches as each moment goes that never really know us
And so it seems she doesn't care
If she has dreams of no one there
Within the shadows of her room

But all my frozen words agree, and say it's time to
Call back, all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen
Inside these empty halls

Wooden lady turn and turn among my weary secrets
And wave within the hours past and other empty pockets
Maybe we've found what we have lost
When we've unwound so many crossed entangling
Misunderstandings; but

All my frozen words agree and say it's time to
Call back all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen

Who is the winner of the war?
Is Mother Nature gonna keep the score
Are we one for all or are we all for one
Or on the outside of a deal well done


Slicker than an oil spill cover up
Left alone like a homeless person's cup
As civilations rise and fall
Libraries burn down to the ground
But love remains standing tall
Although history is a matter of opinion




Technology only goes one direction
The planet shrinks by speed of communication
Resources are being exhausted
Explain to my son just how we lost it
So many crisis so many needs
Leaving us weak with compassion fatigue
Disposable law we push to recycle
'Cause we all now a place that's not so delightful




Campaign contributions run the puppet show
Wall street types let the cocaine flow and flow
Media cowards are afraid to speak
The defense funds the movie of the week
Men in sheeps clothing rob the poor
A bad interpreter could start a war


Military industrial complex
Channel it into a medical context
Take the soldiers that we trained for warfare
Build an army that's trained for healthcare
Take the people that's building bombs
And put them to work building low cost homes
Take the children that's living among us
Teach them the truth about Christopher Columbus
All the leaders who said to ""trust us""
Let me tell you something about their justice
Get four years if you're Michael Milken
But ten to fifteen if you rob the milkman
Let the people lead, let the leaders follow
Today's the day don't search for tomorrow
It's time for us to make some adjustments
'Cause nature's going to make the final judgement




Though we may rise and fall
We must be one for all
Don't let your mind be weak
Don't be afraid to speak

Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics
A large heard across my sight, I had to fight to clear it 
Like a runner a couple of summers, I often wondered if it
Really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder
A current was occurring, it was stirring up my hunger
But I couldn't let the **** bury a ***** under 
Used to cry hoping all of this would pass
And then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass
A part of my swag but apparently I won
'Cause I took my shades off and now I'm staring at the sun

I'm seeing the light, I'm seeing the light
Uh, realizin' that it's me in the light

I read about it 
Heard about it , and now I know 



I could did wrong
I seen a lot of people hustle but I left them things alone
I almost lost my friend to the struggle
But I guess that made me strong, made me strong
I seen a whole lot of drama and it taught me how to fight
Taught me how to fight
And I thank God for my mama, she showed me what was right
I coulda been in the dark, but thank God for the light
 I seen the light

Bring on the Tequila oh
On fire on Tequila oh


My friends and I meet hours before
We make some home made pizza
We do some funny bits back and forth
My knees buckle I laugh so hard
We might end three sheets to wind
And who knows where we'll wind up
All I know is there’s a car waiting
And we’ll figure that out after
I have to keep my eye on my old friend from high school
We’ve known each other for the longest time
She has trouble with her dance so to speak
She can hoist a really good kick in the butt when she's excited
She doesn’t do it so much anymore
Because we’re all on to her


Bring on the Tequila oh
On fire on Tequila oh
Mostest most on Tequila oh
Bestest friends on Tequila oh


Then there’s my other pretty friend from high school
The predator in me is put to shame by the predator in her
And now I've reeled it in
It’ll be interesting to see how much she’s done as well
Then there’s my friend from Chigago
God do I love all people from Chicago
All ready to light up the barbeque
And be harping on debauchery


Bring on the Tequila oh
On fire on Tequila oh
Mostest most on Tequila oh
Bestest friends on Tequila oh


Then there’s my Canadian friend
What a fabulous mom she’s become
She’s been tortured in this sense
For the last many of months for obvious reasons
She was like ""hey where was this part of you when I wasn’t pregnant""
I laughed and did a shot in her honor
As I conversed with her belly


Bring on the Tequila oh
On fire on Tequila oh
Mostest most on Tequila oh
Bestest friends on Tequila oh


Then there’s my Cupid friend
She sure knows how to dress that one
She’s a wise and worldly girl
But you gotta watch that medication
My favorite beverage is taken to a whole other level on it
I’m not worried about it or I’ll coast around the room
While I trust she’ll temper
My brother came to visit me
And now he’s used to hanging with me and cracking up
But he had no idea about my built up tolerance
No idea about how manipulative I’ve become
I would surreptitiously put it in front of him without him asking
In a pretty little shot glass
His smirk and cackle would only egg me on


Bring on the Tequila oh

"Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah

We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air

In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars
The endless search for where you are


Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!

Don't sail away on a crimson tide!
Don't leave your heart on the other side!
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire with a special name
Don't ever fall in love!
Don't give your heart away!
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up


Don't cry, dry your eyes 
You gotta keep your head up
Don't cry, dry your eyes 
You gotta keep your head up
Don't cry, dry your eyes 
You gotta keep your head up
Don't cry, dry your eyes 


Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up


Don't cry, dry your eyes 
You gotta keep your head up
Don't cry, dry your eyes 
You gotta keep your head up
Don't cry, dry your eyes 
You gotta keep your head up
Don't cry, dry your eyes 


And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up

Lost for words with nothing to share
Lost beats with no emotion
Swimming through remotest ocean
Vague shapes and blunted knives
Give their best to crupled up lives
In this port there's nowhere to go
Only void to swallow you whole

Sometimes we might wander through these aisles
Picking up the tracers with our minds
Tell me this is where I crossed the line
Winding through the isle of lost songs

Lost loves, they rot around you
Their molten despair fills the blank air
Lost chords they can't be broken
Drenched on holes, words unspoken
Vague shapes and lying signs
Take the beauty from these lost lives
In this world there's nowhere to go
Only void to swallow you whole

Sometimes as we wander throught these rites
Picking up transmissions with our wires
Tell me there is something to inspire
Living there inside these lost songs

Fear
You're just a name that I have learned
Another way for me to turn
And you brought me here
And it took years for me to find
That you were only in my mind

Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love


Hope
You're just a name that I hold close
There when I needed you the most
And you brought me here
Where I can learn to love myself
Without the love of someone else

I've felt the guilt of a senseless life

You move like a flame of fire
Your eyes like a flash of lightning
The answer to all desire
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing

Watch out - anywhere you go I'll find you
Watch out - I'll be staying close behind you
And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
Oh, you'd better watch out

You act like I was a stranger
I think you're beginning to hate me
But then you're a girl in danger

Ooh, I said you'd better watch out

Oh mother, sweet Caroline
Feels like you shot me with a .38 or a .45
And my heart's bleeding, baby
Can't feel my legs I'm paralyzed
I know you just in it for the moment, so I'll enjoy the ride


Eyes start rolling in back of my head, girl, I'm already gone

Medically, tell me what you really wanna do
Generally, niggas think they better than me, boo
Niggas really tryna put they foot up in my shoe
That's when I make a panic, I don't really understand it
That's when I lay 'em down, they tryna get a better view
Genuinely see the way I regularly choose
Whack niggas switch, I'm up to legendary view
Somethin' from benal, they already really knew
Instead of tryna fuck you, need to get a better crew
Lactose, switch, I came up back close
Better know I back those, I don't wanna let it go 
Damn folks, shawty wanna stand close
When a nigga bang those panties, and I let it blow 
He didn't really wanna do it
Then what it gets a nigga that be flowin' like a fluid
And I be damagin' everything every time a nigga get up on it, it's nothin'
We know that they already do it and ain't nothin' really to it
Pull up, stop, how 'bout a drop top?
Then I'm unlocked, I got my Glock cocked
That's how we do it over here
Do not hop on the mic on a wrong block, not
Y'all niggas know what it is
Yeah, you know the way I put it down for 'em
That's right, got 'em loose
Ain't no buggin', baby girl, you can see the grab on 'em
Now y'all don't really want to get a better blow

Who cannot wait for you to be gone
Then you count to ten
And she looks upon your skin
And so begin to compose a vow
Never hold a gun or a sign it isn't fun
And fun is how you should define
One's way to be
Bedding down with twins and hoping
God will walk right in and take a picture of
This holy group of three

And kills the yearn to justify

I had to practice the come up
I’m on a roof to see the bottom
Yo these niggas be wilding they really losing me
Niggas that was saying they fuck with me was using me
But that was way back when I used to be what I used to be
They took the ladder off of the building
And told us catch up
So I started flipping onions just so I could get my bread up
But now I’m going ham in the building
Cause they ain’t let us
Saying fuck the mozzarella
Cause nigga I wanted cheddar
My heart colder than a case of beers in the freezer
This is how you niggas made me though
Yeah
I ain’t no killer until a motherfucker give me a reason
I ain’t never let em play me though
And the other day
This bitch gon' tell me she love me
Then she said that she hate me
And now she saying i’m ugly
Before she wanted my baby
Niggas say I’m funny and tell me that they made me
But when I start going crazy don’t look at me like I'm crazy nigga
Yeah, don’t look at me like I'm crazy
My nigga moving that white
But don’t look at him like he shady
My nigga move with that Tom Hilfiger
How to go brady ?
And all my niggas gone to the max

I ain’t saying I’m a player
But I’m kinda smoove
Shawty gave me head the other day
I wouldn’t lie to you
I’ll show the way her knees and toes go when she riding you
Head, shoulders, knees, and toes, I'll body you

They never told me this but cash rules niggas around me
And I noticed it
The Girls, the girls, they love us, I know this shit
But girl you ain’t my only bitch that wanna be my only bitch
I did a couple niggas a favor but they don’t owe me shit
Cross me and I number 2 on em holy shit
Oh well waves on swim

My heart ten degrees in the summer and that’s how cold it get
Understand it, I'ma get it on my own

They say words don’t hurt you
But a stick'll break a bone
If they throw me in the jungle
I'ma make that shit my home
And it's coat on the dishes
Pocket full of wishes
Got my heart broke now I ain’t fucking with you bitches
And got my heart broken
Now it’s covered up with stitches is the only way of fixing it
Listen I said many men
Many, many many many men
Want my head I’m just tryna get my bread up
Niggas ain't loyal got me fed up

What about the times we was on the corner flipping quarters
Tryna get a half on sunny days
We was selling waters
Birthdays was the worst days
Used to cop a 50 cent juice from the ocks when we was thirsty
Chose getting money in the worst ways
Robbing, stealing, and selling crack behind project buildings
Mama called us super heros
Nigga yall say villains
Mind telling me to chill but my heart say kill em
So I keep the 9s on me for any nigga that keep they eyes on me
Real eyes, realize, real lies
Niggas lied on me
Switching sides on me
I thought we was cool
Why you want me to die homie?
If they ain’t down to die, why you gon' ride for em?
Niggas wanna kill em and before I would’ve died for em
I don’t fuck with niggas wanna know why
Cause them same old niggas used to say they gon' ride
Nowadays I don't know if niggas love or hate me
What’s the difference between love and hate?

"Not what you are

But what you've earned

Where jack-queen-king

Money's concerned

A friend in need is a friend in debt

That kinda friend king money can forget

May those that are full get struck dumb

When they tell the hungry of the good times

To come

More money than sense in their defence

And cheaper jokes at our expense

So if your king is money

Then I feel sorry for you

And if you think that it's funny

Then maybe you do...

Maybe you do king money

King money, king money

The midas touch doesn't mean

That much until you're crippled with greed

Using gold as a crutch or half a man

For half a crown for half a kingdom

For half a town

No geldt-in-my-pelt-jack

No cash in my shack so tell me the things

That you think I lack

Just what kinda price are you willing to pay

For a holiday from the royal tourniquet

So if your king is money

Then I feel sorry for you

And if you think that it's funny

Then maybe you do...

Maybe you do king money

King money, king money

Standing by the xerox machine

I want to duplicate some money

Build a fortune up in black and white

But I'll need a master copy

You're gonna give your love to me

Shake an apple off the apple tree

When she moves it's poetry

Come to me now, one, two, three

King ka

King ka

King king money

Plan the perfect double murder

Maybe win the pools when I get some money

Honey, I'll be knee high in consumer

Durables

Adorables...

No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say


Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I


Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway


Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I


Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine


Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die

Wond'ring if I'm wrong or right
To think about you, though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight

The rain is cold and slowly falling
Upon my window pane tonight
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight

You broke my heart, you never loved me
Though you often said you cared
And now you've gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared

The rain is cold and slowly falling
Upon my window pane tonight
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight

Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight

Upon my window pane tonight

When I'm backed against the wall

'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
And I'm so lost, under club lights
In the all black, GothBoiClique


GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise

Fucked up in the back of the club
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
I got scars on me, no love
Light a candle and I pray for Døves
And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood
It's so fucked
So tell me what is love
If I ever had it, if I ever had it
Did I really want it?
And why can't I remember?
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
It's a slow drug
And I swear that
But it's true love
These are true lines


Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed 
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', ""Why don't you love me back?!""
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse

And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy
Humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Or something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod, I recall
So many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it
Mama said it, ""The best thing you can do and be is you""
""This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due""
Ain't that the truth? And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around


Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate
Sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust
Turn on your faucet
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade


Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need


Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth, it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve
I practiced repetition, I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze, Dad kept this in the dungarees
I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them loco jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this
Underscore, it's just me and dope
Dirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to feed me


Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need

I miss the warmth of her good fire
I know he's guilty, now that you know
I bet you want to be in heaven, in heaven



Put faith in who we 
We wait for the crack of feather stones
We are the jaded apostles

On the way to another home tomorrow
Now the body saying we must go
If I have the

It's been such a long time
Since I set foot in the club
I really hate this shit, don’t I?
I hate feeling rushed, girl, can I just be honest?
I don't feel like talkin' unless it’s 'bout me, or philosophy
Can we just get down to business?
And when we're both finished, then we'll have a reason to speak


Then you can open up to me, girl
Let me plant my seed, girl
Let me fill your needs, girl
Open up to me, open up to me


The piano that I fuck you on
Same one that on which I write these songs for you
They're one in the same
That goes for us, too, I give you my name
The bed on which I lay to sleep
And lay with you and lay in deep
There ain't no difference, this case there isn't
That goes for us, too, I know you're listenin’
Sometimes it feels like I don’t really care
One day you'll see, but in the meantime
Just trust that I’m there
Just trust that I love you
Just trust that I care
Trust that I need you to always be there
Trust that you know me well enough to know
I'm the high priest but you put on the show


Then you can open up to me, girl
Let me plant my seed, girl
Let me fill your needs, girl

Take your wings outside, you can't fly in here
Besides, a purple sky is better soaring for you, my angel
You're an angel, you little devil
As for me, I'll stay inside
I'll be just fine and I'll watch from the window


Cannot categorize the nature of this sickness
A miracle that you're alive
Stuck to the roof of my mouth with a staple
Remember last April when we saw U.S. Maple?
Somehow, the singer showed the Fireside exactly how I feel


And we say goodbye and go underground
Or up towards the sky, up in smoke, burnt down to size
At least we're still friends
At least we're still alive


Take your wings outside, no use for them in here
Bad luck to open inside
Work like umbrellas, like a broken mirror
It's getting clearer, the end is closer
Than ever before and you'll want nothing more
When your head hits the floor and you're lost in the darkness


And we say goodbye and go underground
Or up towards the sky, up in smoke, burnt down to size
At least we're still friends

I start up in the north
I grow from a special seed
I sprinkle it with sensibility
From French and Hungarian snow
I linger in the sprouting
Until my engine's full


Then I move across the sea
To European bliss
To language of poets
As I cut the cord of home
I kiss my mother's mother
Look to the horizon


Wide eyed, new ground
Humbled by my new surroundings


I am a citizen of the planet
My president is Guanyin
My frontier is on an airplane
My prisons, homes for rehabilitating


Then I fly back to my nest
I fly back with my nuclear
But everything is different
So I wait
My yearn for home is broadened
Patriotism expanded
By callings from beyond


So I pack my things, nothing precious
All things sacred


I am a citizen of the planet
My laws are all of attraction
My punishments are consequences
Separating from source the original sin
I am a citizen of the planet
Democracy's kids are sovereign
Where the teachers are the sages
And pedestals filled with every parent


And so the next few years are blurry
The next decade's a flurry
Of smells and tastes unknown
Threads sewn straight through this fabric
Through fields of every color
One culture to another


And I come alive and I get giddy
And I am taken and globally naturalized


I am a citizen of the planet
From simple roots through high vision
I am guarded by the angels
And my body guides the direction I go in
I am a citizen of the planet
My favorite pastime edge stretching
Begotten with human condition
These ideals are born from my deepest within

I walk the funeral march, and I will make my peace
The past is dead
I walk the funeral march, and I will make my peace


If we stop the clock, will I reappear?
Pulled from the drift, there goes another year
The stars align, the planets shift
All the infinite moments that we've missed
There's parts of me that are lost forever
At least we're all lost together
We all remember youth like it's dead and gone
Like our favourite line from a forgotten song


I'll show you my hurt, and I'll show you my heart
A life lost in the dark


The past is dead
I walk the funeral march, and I will make my peace
The past is dead
I walk the funeral march, and I will make my peace


When I reach the end, will I beg for more?
Will I look back or step through the door?
I stand beneath a monolith
Do you ever feel like you won't be missed?
There's parts of me that are lost forever
At least we're all lost together
I heard that this was only a ride
So there's no worth in waiting for death to arrive


All we are is just a name, it's all we are
Our skin, it shows these crippled bones, youth sinks alone
All we are is just a name, it's who we are
Our skin it shows, these crippled bones, youth sinks alone
I'll show you my hurt, and I'll show you my heart

Move forth the species by using our imagination

Could we dismantle it
Or should we fear the void and just be

And would
If you will believe in all we can conceive

Let me lay it down for you in this song

They want AU
Let me tell you what you really ought to do
Figure out ways to master silicon

So many people don’t even attempt to understand
The limitless possibilities of man

Remain calm collected
Before I get zapped
My computer is a rebel acting all fine
And just like that payin’ me no mind
What’s up is it’s program overcome by a glitch
Is it becoming conscious and if so ain’t that a bitch

Any funny business it’ll be the one that pays the price

All I need is a little bit of illumination
So the rhythm can no longer run and hide
When I take a puff from the leaves of the devil
And it carries me onto the other side

Fire it up
Cause when I fire it up I feel like serenity
Is mine


When I need a little bit of relaxation
My medicine isn't too hard to find
When I'm looking for a bit of rejuvenation
I only partake of the finest kind
And then the mystery begins to unravel
And it helps me break through to the other side

Tradin' places wanna piece of the pie
Good guy, bad guy, we each gotta die
It's all a game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name


Dreams fulfilled, gave us more room to build
Strong climb made more time for wounds to heal
I can see the sun, must've been blessed to be the one
Set, free to run
Same baby moms, new seed to come
Breathin' lungs, through the sonogram see the thumb
So regardless, male or female, love either one
G's and tons branched out, copped the ranch house
To plan,  Martin needed some space to plot my plans out
Speak of life, still rock low, plus the sneaker type
Reefer kites, pushin' a stick make you breeze through lights
See through sites, gun shots, used to run spots
Slung rocks, nearly got rich off of one block
Saw the light, caught a case, couldn't afford to fight
Lawyer white, had to cop out or four to life
Poison bites, my brain, flyin' high flames
Tryin' to change, trapped between worlds kinda strange




Yo it's either or, used to by girl ?Lee Rahol?
G's galore, Christian Dior, devils believe in war
Need some more currency, streets observin' me
Third degree, tryin' to see billions before they murder me
Thoroughly thoughts react, let the Porsche mack accross tracks
Catch me in Haiti, ridin' horse back
Seek religion, study life, tryin' to see the vision
Weeks in prison a help a wise man peep his livin'
Reach decisions, analyze, scope the game, wit hopes to change
Before the stress overdose the brain, most remain
Shockwaves, I rock shades through the Tropic Haze
Under Palm Trees, puffin' lye for days, liver ways
Cold chillin', old villan, known for buildin'
Sittin' back, controlin' millions
What's right or wrong? Shorter days, nights is long
Keep ya cipher strong, just in case, it might be on




So what's the remedy, for bein' invaded by your enemy
Envy me, had a cold heart since infancy
Below freezin', used to flip for no reason
Now beyond that, learned to relax, mastered slow breathin' Blowin' Hundreds
Spendin' paper's so redundant
I'm from it, most large niggas over and done wit
No one to run wit, just a few from the Old School
Ocean cruise, layin' back soakin' the blues, scopin' the views
Never once, open the news
It's all stress, placed on the broke or confused
So know the game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame
While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name

Sitting at the bar, telling fairy tales
Pouring whiskey in wishing wells, feeling sorry for myself
There's only one person in this world that can save me from myself
So I pick up the phone, pray that you're home, I'm all alone


Saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad


There's some jerk at the bar smoking a big fat Cuban cigar
And I wave my hands through the smoke
I think I see you, but it's some kind of twisted joke
Oh, you wouldn't be caught dead in here
Just the thought of me crying would make you disappear


Saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad, so damn bad

Is it your fear of losing
That makes you go further?
What makes me wonder, friend
Is how you get away with your lies
'Cause maybe you have noticed
That I appreciate your company
And every time you have to go
I regret I didn't let you know
I could love you


And when you hung up the phone
I realized I was alone
And I can't help it
You're so beautiful
I can't help it
You're so beautiful


You may have seen the world, dear
But you don't know me
That's why all of this seems so absurd
I lie awake at night
Picturing me and you
I wish I could make it all clear and you'd see
I could love you


And soon the fall is here
Turning us cold
And I can't help it
You're so beautiful
I can't help it

""Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me""
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet


And at once, I knew I was not magnificent


Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles


3rd and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me


And at once, I knew I was not magnificent


Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles


Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory


And at once, I knew I was not magnificent


High above the highway aisle

Yo fat lip man
Yo man they tryin' to run a power move on us man
Yo man
You got to tell the suckers what's up boy
Yeah ha-ha


I got a letter from the DMV
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They tried to tell me that my license was suspended
I got offended
For a minute then pretended
That I never even got the damn letter
It's nine o'clock
On the dot
So I think I'd better
Scoot off to school
Cause in class there's a test
I gotta dress fast
Grab my glasses and my vest
Oh damn
As hardheaded as I am
Hopped in my hooptie ride
Pumped up the jam
Put it in reverse
Into first
And disperse and
From that very moment on my day got worse


As I was standing in the street
I suddenly seen the smoke
I know that Derrick's on his way
I ran to get my coat
And a bag from the room
It took a minute, boom
Hopped into the car
We drove away in a zoom
I assume doom
As we were drivin' on the gravel
At any given minute we could have a shortened travel
So I ramble
About my life  shambles
Should of took the bus
A bus without the silence or some old Nikes
I wish we had good bikes
We need to exercise
Maybe we could take a hike
An' you could give Sheri back those car keys
Because everywhere I walk I would not have to say please


Please
Don't pull me over Mr. officer
Don't pull me over Mr. officer please


Away
To our destination
No license no insurance
Not even registration
Tags on the plate say December '82
Car's so dirty it looks gray
But it's really blue
Who would
Think we're up to good
Four black niggas ridin' through the neighborhood
In hats and glasses
Makin' funny passes
Like drivin' slowly
Playin' low-key for asses
Knowin' damn well one-time will harass us
And all the while
We see girls jog
Sheri's little car is pourin' out smog
Then we made a right and I spotted one in tights 






Lights, action
Without the camera
Si-reens and high beams
Two to a tee
The blue coat billy goats are crowding up my rear view
Hot on the tail of an innocent being
My heartbeat is racin' at a pace so fast
I'm wishin' that the coppers would get off my ass
My tail, can't go to jail cause it's wack
What would happen to my girl and my record contract
Yo fellas 
Take off the baseball caps
Word up I heard that the nerves get tapped
And throw on the glasses and give up the 
Oh please don't pull me over officer please
I'm discombobulated

Discombobulated malfunctionated faded

As he travels on the beast of burden
Moving up along the mountainside
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride
As he journeys across mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him
His reflection of the beauty 'round him
Feeling empty inside
He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved


He's searching for the answer now
It's something that he's managed to avoid up to now
Real conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner than later
Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strive for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to give in now?
His life, his time are the only things that he has


Life is not a rehearsal
All he has is the one chance to get it right
Leaving really is the only way to know
Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
But now the pain of lying too early in the grave


Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace


He tries to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but it's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is it possible to change such a lot?
He's taken someone's life away
There's not a day goes by he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
But the good book says: ""An eye for an eye""
In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgements that will haunt him till his grave
No one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice, so be it


Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight


How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter


You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight




And I feel so good, and I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight


You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You've got lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight


Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
I don't want to lose your lovelight
Shining like a star in the night

Another city, another day
Left all of me on the stage
Hear that train
Hear that lonely highway
Highway

So adrift, so alight
Lost myself in the lights
Spinning wheels kill the time
With you on my mind


Hours of the holy
We were so alone there
Just can't seem to get away
Shade our eyes to veil the pain

Houses of the holy
Whispers of the lonely
Just can't seem to keep me
Off this lost highway

"Some people feel so empty
All their problems and hurt of pride
You make me so happy sweet baby
Love is by my side
Waking up now in the morning
A little morning sigh
Ready not to get it together
We know temptation
Don't tell the whole story
But you and me baby
We have taken inventory
We Blue Monday people
And I know there's a few
I don't know your problems
Only you know how to solve them
When seasons are strong
Sometimes your life don't get along
But when cupboards are bare
Our love we can share
Truth is not the whole question
What is the answer you hide?
The system need us
But it's trying to mislead us
They know this money don't feed us
Depression ain't just
Quite what you promised
Won't you mister be honest
Acting like a child
Sometimes we get wild
Right when the loving is strong
We don't want to get along
Don't have to listen to me
One day you may see
We Blue Monday people
Just trying in a strain
Life breaking our hearts
I'm so tired it's a shame
This hustling affair
Ain't the way I even care
We'll be together in spite
Of the crimes of the night
Crimes of the night
Crimes of the night
Need someone to see me through
Need someone to comfort me
Sometimes you can let me be
Just let me be
Depression Ain't just
Quite what you promised
Won't you mister be honest
Acting like a child
Sometimes we get wild
Right when the loving is strong
We don't want to get along
Don't have to listen to me

Outside of this land there's a star shining free

In silence we stand on a golden horizon calling
This time there's a light for us
Still shining so bright for us again

Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding
While there are so many faces in this mask of lies
Blinded by the promises and a life in pain
Now the time has come for all of us to rise

Through the fires of hell between us, through a lifetime of our dreams
Endless tears still burn inside beneath the sadness of our screams

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing through a thousand year storm
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered for the power of the steel
And the winter rain will fall around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
For the last time we cry now for freedom

Cast aside this dying world forsakes us
Break the chains of all creation now to save our lives
Fires of all eternity and the curse of steel
Like the winter rain we'll tear the blazing skies

From the wastelands of destruction, with the fire we hold inside
Rise again still glorious for the power of all mankind

Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

Spent myself on another, entangled like lovers

And though you find me rather tragic

Unconfined, beyond physical

Not quite dark, not quite light

And though you find me rather tragic...

Built up inside, obscuring danger

My only fear is fear itself
I ain't afraid to die, more afraid of myself
Niggas lookin' at me like I don't hear myself
Like I don't know pain, I been here myself
This life will drive you crazy – only if you let it
I'm just an American expressin', give me some credit
Won't be surprised if before I rise I'm beheaded
These are the days of our lives
Nightmares of a thief comin', takin' my life
I go to sleep thinkin' I may never wake up
In this reality at least I keep my bed made up
I just wish they all could see what I can see
If we could stop it with the violence
And apply a lil' logic, I believe
We could thrive to be a promising civilization
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's not time until it's our time


Don't be so afraid to die
Until it's our time
Don't be so afraid to die
It's our time, 'til it's our time
‘Cause we'll never die


All I see is confusion and chaos
Blatant disorder, authorities pickin' on the minorities
Unfortunately, the land of the free has little to offer me
And got me often thinkin' about offing me
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' broke, and even worse
The upper class act like they don't want me on this earth
This life will drive you crazy – only if you allow it
That's only if you a coward, and you're sure to get devoured
To no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power
Who's gonna take a stand? Who's gonna be a man?
Who do you work for? Please help me understand!
You could be the victor in this situation
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's our time, until it's our time


Don't be so afraid to die
Until it's our time
Don't be so afraid to die
It's our time, 'til it's our time
‘Cause we'll never die


Pardon my immortality
I'm Martin Luther shootin' back on the balcony
Escapin' the Lorraine until they call in the cavalry
Alpha 184, oh Lord, nobody blast for me
If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther
Nigga, show me to the slaughter
I gladly sacrifice what is percieved
Sow my seed, so my seed can live its dreams
My spittin' image, see my stitchin' in his genes
Accordin' to my likeness, his breath of life is priceless
My enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans
Penetratin' America's culture to its very being
It's not political, it's more critical
Spiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical
But I advise y'all to keep me alive
In the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life
Beautiful death, nigga!


Tragedy after tragedy, I know it's sad to see
America killin' her babies like Casey Anthony
We try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity
Poppin' ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy
We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace
We promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece
Put down your piece!
I wish you all a beautiful death — peace!

And in the end if I can't make you mine
I'ma drink myself into a new frame of mind


Having a bottle under the moonlight
Fading away

Fading away
You want me gone
Why can't you kill me yourself


Just having a bottle under the moonlight
Fading away
Wipe the tears from your face and get high

Lying in the park on a beautiful day
Sun shine on the grass and the children play
Siren’s passing, fire engine's red
Someone’s house is burning down on a day like this

The evening comes and we’re hanging out
On the front step and a car rolls by with the windows rolled down
And that War song is playing, “Why Can’t We Be Friends?”
Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs


Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
Somebody’s going hungry and someone else is eating out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody’s heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song


The way your mouth feels in a lover's kiss
Like a pretty bird on a breeze or water to a fish
A bomb blast brings the building crashing to the floor
Hear the laughter while the children play war


Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier’s last breath, his baby’s being born


Standing on the bridge, watch the water passing under me
It must’ve been much harder when there was no bridge, just water
Now the world is small, remember how it used to be
With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars


Watch the sky in a jet plane, so far out of my reach
Is there someone up there looking down on me?
Boy chase a bird, so close but every time
He’ll never catch her, but he can’t stop trying


Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier’s last breath his baby’s being born
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody’s broken heart becomes your favorite song
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out


Standing on a bridge, watch the water passing under me
It must’ve been much harder when there was no bridge, just water
Now the world is small, compared to how it used to be
With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars

"You asked me to dinner
You brought me stuff
Now what do I make of that
You made me an offer
I called your bluff
Now you're an amnesiac

Driving with one hand on the wheel
Ordering luck with every meal
Feeding on hope again never mind how
Small a portion

I said like we do
Like we'd like to think
I'll take care of myself
And who would've thought that
Initial drink
Would clear an entire shelf

Driving with one hand on the wheel
Ordering luck with every meal
Feeding on hope again never mind how
Small a portion

You should look at it realistically
I know you couldn't be in love with me

You sat there as dumb
As a dog or cat
Just hoping it's for the best
As if anything ever
Comes from that
Except an appalling mess

Driving with one hand on the wheel
Ordering luck with every meal
Feeding on hope again never mind how
Small a portion

Now you didn't bank
On the alchemy
That flattery turns to love
But you took that obstructions
Will always be
The danger of falling off

Driving with one hand on the wheel
Not knowing how or what to feel
You only knew that it was enough to be
Feeling something

"Help me breathe
Help me believe
You seem really glad that I am sad

You are not my friend
I cannot pretend that you are

You made it sting
Your voice is ringing
Just like the boys who laughed at me in school

You are not my friend
I cannot pretend anymore

You found a place
No one should ever go

I'll be ok
'cause when I back away
I'm gonna keep the handle of your gun in sight

"Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me


And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that
Or do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?
Or do I ever cross your mind

Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close


Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?
I just wonder do I cross your mind
Oh, Do I ever cross your mind?

Tell me Do I ever 
Cross your mind

"Incontrerai qualcuno che amerai di più
Io non amerò nessuno, mi hai chiuso il cuore tu
Si conoscerai qualcuno e soffrirai perché
Lo amerai come una stupida proprio come me...

E il mio pensiero vola
Ritorna quella sera...
Tu hai bucato la mia vita quando sei andata via
L'hai bruciato in un attimo anche la fantasia
Come un vento gelido tu hai spazzato via tutta la poesia

Sembra quasi impossibile che sia toccato a noi
Una coppia indivisibile, nulla è certo ormai...

Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round


I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch

Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit


This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

"Since the darkness took our minds
They burned our courage many died
Had to leave it all behind rebuild our lives
Passing memories remained
It made my soul a burning flame
Haunted dreams of my desire
Reveal my name
Raise our swords we fight for life
Shields and armor shining bright
Strike like dragons Have no fear
Swords are made of steel

Fly across the high seas and mountains
Rise above the golden horizon
Far away beyond the gates of space and time
Through the wastelands forever and on
Still we fight for our freedom
The cry of the fallen souls bleeding
Forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
Will we face all the fears of the world?
The cry of the brave

Since the time we saw the sign
Destruction of your feeble mind
Centuries have come and gone but nothing's changed
Hopes and dreams have disappeared
Destruction of your kind is near
Trapped inside your suffering eternal flame

Search the darkness search the light
Fierce resistance what a fight
Glory for unholy seal
Lies all cast in steel

Fly across the high seas and mountains
Rise above the golden horizon
Far away beyond the gates of space and time
Through the wastelands forever and on
Still we fight for our freedom
The cry of the fallen souls bleeding
Forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
Will we face all the fears of the world?
The cry of the brave

In the depths of your desire
So secretly you feed the fire
Burning through the memories of all our lives
Watch the day turn into night
You reach out for that guiding light
First to be the one to hear their blinding lies

Fear of darkness fear of light
Sucked in by their ancient might
Ruthless in what you may feel
When your mind they steal

Fly across the high seas and mountains
Rise above the golden horizon
Far away beyond the gates of space and time
Through the wastelands forever and on
Still we fight for our freedom
The cry of the fallen souls bleeding
Forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
Will we face all the fears of the world?
The cry of the brave

Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive
I cry, but in my own way swallow my pride
Pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
Cemetery full of brothers I buried it's goin' down
Even now I wonder will I still be around

C'mon


One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame


Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
I know, death follows me, but I'll murder him first
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
I'm the first one to want him blasted
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit 
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fake in fame



Something thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game

Something thing we all adore
Something we dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game

Pick up a super chicken bac-ca

For the fame  The notoriety
To be well-known  in this society
To have everybody eyeing me
'Cause when I rise up my block mane, my cost is to floss
I'm making up for all the times, that I floss to be lost 
I scream,  'til I was lost forever, nobody came 
So on this day forth, I'ma die for the fortune and fame 
Been on my name  where were all these years that I walk this earth
Went for all mine  especially been cautious since birth
Remain the same, since the day I came , will never change
Even though I live my life hellishly  for all this fame 


Block fronters shoot slugs we throw 'em back like hardballs
Without the gloves
No love for these fake desperadoes and thugs 
I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts sipping Henny
Drunk nights And high days
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways
A life on the run 
Full of common blunts unconditionally married to my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny for needs and ones desires
Be pulling all my cabbage like pliers
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher
Than fortune and fame
Hahaha


Something we all adore
Something we dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
Something we all adore
Something we dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame


I don't want to live forever, it's do or die
I'd be a dead nigga talking gangsta S.P.I
Niggas don't want me to be up in they system when I'm deceased
Talk shit about when I'm up in the coffin nigga you'll rest in peace 
Motherfucker, I die for this shit, I got a lot ridin'
Some niggas be backslidin', some niggas fall off and go into hidin'
Some niggas be players up in the game five years
Some niggas be making one platinum album
Then be gettin' disrespecting O.G. peers
Motherfucking hard since I was fo-teen, partners 
Some niggas be laying up in them streets, broke 'em off somethin' proper
Haters may try to take your soul cold-hearted ass niggas
Gotta ride with two twin Glocks, gotta sleep fingers on triggers
Niggas don't want to see you have nothing, so have something
And if a nigga run up on you, put a slug and get to dumping nigga

Stuck in this pain, stuck in this game

He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool

But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone


Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom

Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes

Eight years old and acting tough
He smiled at me and said, ""You shift the gears""
He would search that FM dial
And I would count down every mile
Til the station out of Tulsa came in clear
It was Earl Thomas Conley on the radio
It punched me in the gut, man, it rattled my soul

Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word

Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong

While hip-hop, rap, and rock were cool
I was in my basement getting schooled
On George and Keith and Vern and Alabama
I was learning 'bout those neon lights
Wasted days and wasted nights
And honky-tonks from Texas to Montana
And when my fingers found the fret board
I close my eyes and sing
I swear that beat up guitar only played one thing

You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me


I wouldn't need a hero
If I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go


All I ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see around here


She kicked New York like a curse
And you traced her footsteps in reverse up to Queens


You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me


I wouldn't need a hero
If I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go


All I ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see around here
Some empty envelopes from some other town
It's all I ever see around here
I'm waiting for something that's not coming

I couldn't help but notice your pain
My pain?
It runs deep – share it with me!


They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker – who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless, rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb ‘cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me – what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family – what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs!
Got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang-bangers and drive-by's
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young, but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court, so fuck what you thought!
I'm drinkin' Hennessy, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain


Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain

Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain



Years and years of that rough life
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife
And livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors
See 'em fake a move and chase 'em down like the fuckin' Predator
Get in trouble every day in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches ‘cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passin' me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's lookin' lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back yo, give 'em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo' ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you owe, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game
And my mama always cryin' yo, there's so much pain


Ohhhh…
So tired, so tired...

Ohhhh…
So...so...



They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed, and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust – I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust – on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‘cause I ain't lookin' when I'm blastin'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy, and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die, tell me why
‘Cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
I keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real, they cannot see
And every day is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother, I'm touched
Out kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean, until they kill me
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me; there's so much pain


Ohhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain

Ohhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain

Ohhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain

Tired of the strain and the pain

Just run and hide

I thought I burned that house, so I tossed the keys
I must've never lost the pics, 'cause they're haunting me

A fresh start'll take my mind off the sex appeal
I still want the women, but I'll let 'em chill
I guess it was a pipe dream
Made it to the league, not the right team
They shoulda known ain't another artist like me
And I came from a genre that don't like me
Wifey left and I couldn't go get her
Too focused on tryna be a tone setter, uh
By the time I could see the whole set-up
The label fell apart and my home was no better, uh
So glad I could call on my brother
We made a whole album and he let me keep the money
So sad that I lost Mya's mother
And even though we moving on, I'm always gonna love her, yeah ya'll

No regrets, just passing here
And I ain't exiting to come back

And half the check-ins spent half the check, yeah
And I knew this whole thing was gon' be tentative
I seen a pretty penny payed for some penitence
I seen people judge people
Be enemies, be friends then different and then be friends again
And say that's forgiveness, but that's an industry I was committed in
That's how Christian rap get dividends
That's some new friends, you get what you got
I knew from the get-go that my cousin was finna pop
So in seven years, some people will love you just to leverage it
Don't look too long that those with limited celebrities
Sittin' next to this puppy to keep it real
Can't depend on record deals, I'm here switching careers

Of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure

Your beauty on my bruise like iodine

I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime?
You said, ""Don't worry, don't worry, darling,""
You said, ""Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time""

You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, oh sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, oh sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine

Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine

No, I've not seen you this way before
Standing a mess at my door
Well, it took you so long
But you finally found
You're no one until someone lets you down

You believed that all people are kind
And that you'd never mess with your mind
You gave her your trust
And she busted your crown
You're no one until someone lets you down

Yes, I've been told
That some people grow old
Without losing a part of their soul
But if that is true
I don't wish it on you
There's so much to adore in a heart that is blue

There's a light in your eyes that is pure
That you won't give away anymore
But just think of the things
We can talk about now
You're no one until someone lets you down

Yes, I have heard
There are some that avoid
All the pain that will come with the fall
But if that's the case
It would surely erase
All the joy that you feel
When the hurt fades away


There's a heart ticket train on the way
Waitin' to take you away
Will you please keep in mind

"The hidden flaw of man is his insatiable desire to dominate though he can only feel complete when everybody sees what he sees

From this dependence, mankind gains weakness; sickening from a lack of progress
It feeds off the instability of the weaker through manipulation, fears and lies
The collective abide

What one man accomplishes alone becomes envy of the frail
The feeble aim to deprive him of this ambition
It is this insubordination of the individual that agitates society's strive for the preservation of its normalcy
As if it lingered

The herd casts a veil that everyone is all one in the same, but this could never be further from the truth
It is this myth that the weaker grasps in desperation to justify the denial of profit

The depth of humanity's adversity entrenches beyond abysmal scales when it grasps on mirages of promises
Society falls while the collective dances to the waltz in synchronized formation; tethered to chains welded with lies

“Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! Step right up! We welcome you this glorious evening to witness the degradation of our fellow man
Seven billion performers will show you what you won't see elsewhere! I bring to you, the human sheep!”

Tell me, baby, are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you're only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, love, tell me, 'cause I get caught up
In the life I live, it's hell, see, I never thought
I'd see the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?
I've been known to clown and get around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
Cause I hate it when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin' in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go—


Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go
Throw them the finger!
You know what, baby, it's like—


I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?


Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin', I'm passin' by
Everybody knows I'm ballin', and to God
Gotta keep myself from fallin', but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was—


Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up!
That's just the thug in me, girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like—


I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?


A lot of people think it's easy to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—


Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?
Throw your fingers up!
You know? They gonna peep this
This how we run game on you
All my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up, give 'em the finger!

"Even though I know the rain may fall
Somewhere the sun will shine

And the melody returns again
Right in the tabs of time

If you don't believe me
Nothing I can do to change your mind
You've got to ride that road
Your own way and your own guitar

Even though I know the tabs keep changin'
They must be turn once more

And the melodies
Shadows of memories
Have all been played before

Marcie in a coat of flowers
Steps inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour
Still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains
Hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and
Wave another day goodbye


Marcie's faucet needs a plumber
Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer
Greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches
Stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches
Stops a postman passing by
And summer goes
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper
Winter blows
Up from the river there's no one to take her
To the sea


Marcie dresses warm its snowing
Takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going
Sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River
Past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered
Still the winter days unfold
Like magazines
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars
Make a dream
Dream back to summer and hear how
He tells her
Wait for me


Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us
Where or why she moved away
Red is angry green is jealous
That was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday
Window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket
And went west again

Sad on your muthafuckin b-day? Bitch, what the fuck?! Don’t you realize you poppin'? Every time you walk in the room you break necks. Necks?! But you tellin' me you sad on your muthafuckin' b-day?


I sit here and tell you my problems, that’s how this work, right?
I’m s’posed to be open and honest, but I got time, right?
My niggas having seshes and I’m doin' sessions
Can’t man up if masculinity your only weapon
Man, I’ve thought about suicide a hundred times
But, I'd hate to disappoint and see my momma cry
Birthdays these days be the worst days
'Cause I know I’m gettin' older and not happier
Me and my father love each other but we barely show it
He hates that I left home and the lawn is now his to mow it
He look at my generation and think that fashion's over
I kill my sister if she ever model Fashion Nova 
I'm always on a flight, or I'm in a hurry 
I miss when losin' my virginity was my only worry 
Back when puttin' on a condom had me really scary 
And milkshakes were the only time we'd eat a cherry
I think learnin' how to eat pussy from someone who eat pussy
Is better than learnin' from someone who doesn't
And that's word to my ex and that's word to my tongue 
And that's word to the woman
Who had my heart beatin' drums 
Yeah, love is what I cherished and Miss Parrish 
Flew all the way to Paris and we made out on my terrace 
I kept it on the low low, 'cause I was in love 
And the shade I had in my room was already enough 
I'm goin' on some dates and I'm makin' some plans
But it's hard to find some love if the girl is a fan 
And after we fuck, she want a picture with me
She got me feeling like Paper Boi, but I cry when she leaves, yeah

They meant for you and me so we'll never end up as strangers

When you see a young brotha up in first class 
And you damn right my ego like Lavar Ball 
They hate to see a black man who can't get blackballed 
I said my paper long , my paper long 
You damn right, bitch , my paper long

Play the cello for the fellows, fake as silicone 
I went from plaque in my teeth to havin' plaques on the wall

Young nigga, like Jigga, tryna make me a boss
I'll take my momma to Louis and take your girl to the Ross, nigga
Back in the muthafuckin' building 
Your boo thing want my children 
My net worth gon' be billions 
Shorty gimme head like ceiling 
Dick disappear, chameleon 
And like I'm muthafuckin' rollin' 
My whip bought, it's not stolen

They meant for you and me so we'll never end up as strangers
Will Ferrell's ass can't even handle this weather
Tune in your speakers and please be my Dr. Whoever


Hey doc, do I tell em how I actually feel? 
Or do I see a therapist and numb the pain with the pills
This for niggas play tough won't even smile in mirrors 
And we learned to fuck hoes off trial and error
Friday nights, where them broke niggas ball out
And Aminé be the name that your girlfriend gon' call out 
To all my niggas with some melanin, let your feelings settle in
If you feelin' worthless 
You should probably go and tell a friend 
Yeah, but, I should take that advice
This year has been crazy, what the fuck is my life? 
My best friend got married, you can bet that I cried
I met Spike and Brad Pitt, no malls, I'm Saks Fifth, nigga 


Get your shit together and turn the fuck up!

Every time the day darkens down and goes away
Pictures open in my head of me and you

Covered up by what we did and didn't do

What was I supposed to say?

Don't be scared to Bankhead or Bogo
Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?

Forty cal. for them cock suckers, sit ‘em back slow
What y'all know about coke pies, give 'em that low
I’m Malcolm before the bow tie, the simple cash flow
Rap NY, no lie, my side is Tabasco, so hot
Crooked cops are searching your asshole, it's the drop
That freeze niggas right where they stand for the gwap
Niggas'll play Pac and pop at they man, it don't stop
We up top, but we locked and landing
He roadblock, he flow shots, get ghost and scram
Gingerbread niggas on the run from feds
Shit is sick, pretty chicks'll put a gun to ya head
Never a vic', either think quick or end up dead

Good boy leathers, hood boys'll blast you

And love hip hop, the shit that bring money outta ziplocs
Protect your dome, I'm warning you, what harm I do to the kid
I have you on the floor with ya armor loose
Break the raw down and sign truces
Then switch the next muthafuckin' date, fuck all excuses
When you see me it's real, I'm just a natural born hustler

So every soldier that's armed, remind your general
It's critical, you might stay a night, if you presentable

He dry snitching, post up in the whip with a fly wisdom
Hopped out to get a dutch, but he left with his wig splitten
We from New York, my city never sleeps 
We runnin' with a hundred heats
When beef pop off, we ain't the one to speak
Dressed in all black, driving sixteen hearses
With sixteen niggas, dropping sixteen verses

Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue

On this new morning with you


Can’t you hear that motor turning?
Automobile coming into style
Coming down the road for a country mile or two
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you


The night passed away so quickly
It always does when you’re with me


Can’t you feel that sun a-shining?
Ground hog running by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
So happy just to be alive

That you will never want to let her go
Unless you leave her first
Then you come out on top
But, still there's just one thing
You haven't got


Peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space


You know it takes a long, long time 
When first you gave and shared your soul
Showed her all those things that take their toll
She knows your weak spot
But, she still gets you hot
So you do it again
Reveal what lies within


And go for peace of mind

I ride through the air, I laugh as I die
With powers of evil, dark knowledge is mine

Ma best m'a dit ce soir ne me dis pas bye bye
Elle a éteint les lumières elle m'a dit ce soir on gère nos bails bails bails


Elle connaît mes envies
Elle connaît tous mes vrais amis
Lè chèr an mwen ka pran tèt an mwen sé-y ki sèl vitamin
La confiance règne ici comme une co-pilote sur un rallye
Elle connaît ma femme aussi
Mon poto c'est son mari
An pé pa kaché-y ayen
Li menm pé pa manti ban mwen
Donc elle me dit passe chez moi
Soirée pizza
""Et les amours""
Je lui dis ""Ça va""
Et là je vois que ça lui plaît pas
Je vois son visage qui change
Elle a un secret qu'elle cache depuis des mois ça la dérange
Qu'elle en peut plus
Qu'elle en dors plus tellement que ça la démange
Qu'elle veut me montrer quitte à tout changer


Ma best m'a dit ce soir ne me dis pas bye bye
Elle a éteint les lumières elle m'a dit ce soir on gère nos bails bails bails
I ouvè pòt-la i di mwen antré
Ka i pasé
Ola an yé Bondyé
Ma best m'a dit ce soir ne me dis pas bye bye
Et éteins ton bigo


Après ça je savais plus si c'était ma best
Est-ce que je dois continuer ou l'amitié cesse ?
Dois-je l'appeler sexfriend ou brûler ses fringues ?
Pour ne plus penser à cette soirée qui me rend dingue
Quand ma femme le saura elle me tuera c'est sûr
Dois-je tout lui dire ou partir rapide en voiture ?
Car ça ne va pas tarder et pour elle je veux pas que ça hurle

Break the calm before the fall
Bad news travels at the speed of flight
Good news not at all
And here we are again
Playing endless games of war
Birds of prey

Without a word of warning
We dive in to attack
Vengeful and self-righteous
We turn the blue sky black
And a wretched few escape
They'll be forever looking back
At our sacrifice

And the golden sun is rising
At the dawn of a beautiful day

In the name of all that's holy
In the name of history
In the face of life and nature
We are driven by belief
Our faith a crumbling fortress
Once perfect and sublime
Will fail again and rise again

Kept me up all night with it
Bitch wanna suck my dick
Her pussy better come all tight with it

From early, homie had hip-hop in him
The era of the unlaced kicks, he was rockin' 'em
Way before the sheepskin flicks, chicks been jockin' him
Right down the block from Wop and 'em
Niggas either dead or the Feds is knockin 'em, he's still here
Comparisons in these years is real rare
It's embarrassin', the bars he spit, he still care
Never let a bitch in his ear, it ain't worth it
When alone, you gotta look in the mirror, what's the purpose?
From the gutter, bad motherfucker
From under that hustler's umbrella, none other
Than he who speaks when needed
Once said, then his dead homie won't repeat it, well bred
Black with the solar facts, so exact
I was told they want the old God back, I'm here

Seen bullet wounds leak, blood seep through the tar, baby pa

Supposedly I'm potent with poetry, the almighty
Most likely in the midst of the sheisty
I know the D.A. got dreams to indict me, do the math
I came, I saw, I smashed
Seen niggas get millions, get murdered and bagged
All I ask is those that respect the code
Respect my mode, I'm a HBO episode
Filmed in the streets of New York, it's real talk
My whole life is sealed in the cork, it's rap's fault
Coupes, cribs, chauffeurs and yachts, gimme props
'Til I'm dead and my physical rot, I'm still hot

From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts


This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For…  and for…  
And all my birds of paradise 
Who never got to fly at night 
'Cause they were caught up in the dance


Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black 
Into the blue 


Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind


There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them 
There's nothing to hold on to 
The colors used to lure you in 
And put you in a trance

And I ain't gonna settle 'til that shit reaches your fuss


And now you're on your ass, and now you're on a ass
Knowin' you ain't listenin' to shit 'cause you an ass
Life ain't gonna sneak up on your ass and take a bite
It's gonna take that life back, baby, it's life
Life is a bone in the battlefield
Girls, boys will learn to kill
On with the endless slaughter


Yeah, born in hell, givin' you all my time in hell
And I love it, oh no, no, I'ma go psycho on this hoe 
You're a sad lawless whore doin' this war inside out for?

Gonna put these motherfuckers on the floor, so they can dance
I'ma need a little kimchi, take a pump, load it up
Throwin' it in the back with the jaguar loaded up
Been drinkin' muff since the 1819
How 'bout goin' meet us in the back on the ninth green?
Pussy hole never made a tootsie roll, give a shit
Clean up in this bitch just like a bag of gold, here we go
Oh my God, it's that white rapper guy
That white Leo tellin' everybody Gemini
That's me, I'm the Leo on the flo'
Baby girl, tell me your sign before you go
'Cause I'm about to chip it in the hole like bubba
Hope I don't bust another hole in the rubber
'Cause I ain't got another baby name I could use
Maybe Tom Cruise, I'm about to hit Dre to fix


So, what you really know about that?
Probably nothin', you ain't know about nothin'-nothin'
You got somethin' to say, then say it
If you gon' say it then fuckin' say it
I ain't afraid to look you in the face

Tell me, boy, what you gonna say when I'm in your face?

Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants, that old soft shoe
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he lightly touch down?
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance

I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughing slapped his leg stale
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell
He grabbed his pants for a better stance
Oh, he jumped so high and he clicked up his heels
He let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him
Just traveled about
But his dog up and died, he up and died
And after 20 years he still grieves
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance

He said, ""I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
Because I drinks a bit""
He shook his head, yes, he shook his head
I heard someone ask him, ""Please ...

The skulls on these walls, are they connected to you?
The stars are like eyes climbing out of a mist
The temperatures rise like an easter morning sun

And sometimes I wonder whether my other half is you


Cause I am only half, of what I am
And half of that is what lies can do
Where the rest is, I don't know

Getting high, watching time fly

Okay, tick tock, Audemars wrist watch
I keep a stick, I keep a big Glock
You get hit, I do not miss shots
I keep a stick, I tell her, ""Kick rocks""
Okay, get rocks, wrist go drip, drop
I do not kiss, you making shit hot
You think I'm dumb, I ain't no kid
Thought you was in love
You ain't my bitch, nah


Ayy-ayy, AYLEK$!
Your vision division, can't fit in my time frame
Connecting the dots and comparing our dreams
We just say the same thing
Now I'm chasing a bag, and I'm blowing the stacks
Get it back on the same day
Your bitch hit on my jack, rubber blow in the back
Can you fuck her the same day?
Tell me, how many bands is you really finna spend right now?
If you really wanna dance, you gon' use no hands
And just shake that upside down
Got a little big booty, bitch, her kitty cat go meow
Got a little AYLEK$ switch, they really wanna put me down

Well, God said to Abraham ""Kill me a son""
Abe said ""Man, you must be putting me on""
God said ""No""
Abe said ""What?""
God said ""You do what you want to, Abe but
The next time you see me coming, you'd better run""
Abe said ""Where do you want this killing done?""
God said ""Out on that Highway 61""
Well, Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare department would give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard ""Where can I go?""
Howard said ""There's only one place I know""
Sam said ""Quick man, tell me, I got to run""
Howard just pointed with his gun
He said, ""that way down on 61""
""Well, Mack the finger,"" said Louie the King
""I got 40 red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that won't ring
You know where I can get rid of these things?""
And he said, ""Now let me think for a minute son""
Said ""Yes that can be easily done
Just take them down on that 61""


That highway
Highway

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
""My complexion,"" she said, ""is much too white""
He said ""Come here and stare up into the light""
And said ""Mmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother it's been done""
But the second mother with the seventh son
They were out on that highway 61
Now, the roving gambler was very bored
Trying to create the next world war
And he found a promoter, fell on the floor
And said ""I've never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yep, I think it can be easily done""

""We'll just put some bleachers there out in the sun
Have it out on that 61""

Engine idling in your drive

Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind

A little spray of my cologne all over your pillows
Still feels like I'm so close
Let me leave my shape in your bed
Let me leave a little song in your head
Make you dance in the dark like you're still in my arms

Fun times in Babylon

Before the dam goes up at the foot of the sea
Before the New Wing of the Prison Ribbon Ceremony

Ride around the wreckage on a horse knee-deep in blood
Look out, Hollywood, here I come

Hah, when your life goes out of bounds
Come back to your stomping grounds
Hey, another rap, another thrill-thrill
There's no such thing as overkill-kill
Sometimes, you need some latitude
When you're out there working on attitude
Very sexy, a little shy
Whatever's gonna get you by guy
Dig, a new caché, a new sashay
And maybe we'll go all the way
All the way to the top
To the very tippy-tippy top, to the top!
Whoo!


When you walk and talk, I can see it in your eyes
You're much too young to be oh so wise
It's the soul inside, it's the life of fun
It's everything that you've ever known
It's the background, it's a major affair
It's a thrilling run to everywhere, ah


'Cause you can't stop the street
Mighty rhythm puts funk in your feet
You can't stop the street

Every night and day, giving everything you got
You're much too young to be oh so hot
To use your body and soul, there's only one rule
You can play any part, but don't play the pool
You've got common sense, you're on common ground
With uncommon people just not found!

You can't stop the street

You must keep grooving and  on
And when the  it goes on and on
And nobody stops, nobody stops the street!

So here it comes, give me tonight
You better come along or move aside
'Cause you can't hide, and don't retreat
Listen to the sound of the funky beat
Uh, huh

Always know that you gotta go do
What ya feel, but don't forget, make it real
No doubt, it’s about stayin’ true

Always know that you gotta grow, so
Honestly, it's best that you know

Take a bite of it and last longer deep in your bones
In your chromosomes faster, beautiful disaster
We can throw a party, get you out of your homes

Breaking it down, whatever the fuck we wanna be

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes


Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow


I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you!


Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you


Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

"Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain
And planted some pines in the sand
Every day I looked their way
But just couldn't understand

Why they never grew like I thought they should do
I just couldn't understand why
Now I've rambled around this wide world through
And today I just happened by

Tall pines, tall pines
Reaching up for the clouds
Tall pines, tall pines
I bet you wouldn't know me now

I'll never forget the morning I left
The hum of the bees in the hay
The farther I walk, the harder they talk
How silent it seems here today

There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch
Surrounding the old family graves
And there's one gravestone standing all alone
There waiting to join me in the shade

Tall pines, tall pines
Reaching up for the clouds
Tall pines, tall pines
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs

He's a large and ugly giant monster, headless on my back
This urgent haste in my head
Materialized in this dark whole world
No one can help me there
I know this pain has gone too far
The fear is now so loud
Kill a child I'm trying to protect myself
Against your old controlled hate
Pollution of mind filled all the space and destroyed my light
At least mine were never allowed


The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light


I wanted to hate, I wanted to die
I wanted to see you sacrifice
I had to deal with the fear you gave me
But you fucker never tried to help me
I was jealous and I was scared
Nobody ever replaced my pain
To say I'm not evil, to tell I'm not bad
Too late, I'm lost in human nature

Leave me be
Set me free
Leave me be
Set me free


The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light


Unexpected yet expected, emerged from the dark I come to life
Take everything if you give my horse it's head
You know me, you fear me
Always me knocking at your door, always around
Insulted, disrespected, return to the dark into this life
You know me, you fear me x4
You know me, you fear me

Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart

Round the curve
And a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
I's keeping right alongside
Rev for stride
4th of July
Night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the undertow
Far from the overload

Once in awhile
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July
Night ride home

"Down through the dark trees
You came to save me
You're so ugly and you're so beautiful
You're like no one on Earth could be

Take me home
Let me be the one

All of my life I've been waiting
For you
I wanna be the one that you take home
Let me be the one
'Cause I'm so lonely

Take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
Take me home
In time you'll love me like one of your own
So come on...

Take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
Take me home
In time you'll love me like one of your own
So come on...

Take, take me home
With you
No one on Earth knows me like you do
La la la la....I'm going home

Some people think I'm crazy
But try to understand
I get satisfaction
Out of everything I can
The losers and the winners
The laughter and the tears
The noises of the day to day
Is music to my ears
And I like it
Yeah I like it, whooa


Gonna live it up this time
And dance like the song is never ending
Gonna get so high tonight
You won't be able to bring me down
Cause I like it
Yeah, I like it


Driving down the highway
The wind is in my hair
And if I hit a traffic jam
I swear that I won't care
Living the lows
Makes the highs that much higher
And the sun will shine through
The smoke and fire of love
Whooa, love
Whooa


Gonna live it up this time
And dance like the song is never ending
Gonna get so high tonight
You won't be able to bring me down
Cause I like it
Yeah, I like it


A sea couldn't wash away
The happiness I've come to find since love
Has taught me how to break
Break these chains that hold me back
Noisy streets and the sleepy bars
Neon signs and the rusty cars
How many nights have I wondered how
One goes through life without seeing the beauty of love?
Whooa, the beauty of love
Whooa


Gonna live it up this time
And dance like the song is never ending
Gonna get so high tonight
You won't be able to bring me down
Cause I like it
Yeah, I like it


Whooa, baby, I like it
Oh, yeah, I like it

"I'm in a good way on a bad day
Thinking of a plan a way to stay on top of it
Nailin' in I have a fit if I sit, sit doin' nothin'
Which is what. I done so far but I carve a niche
Which sits in my good things brain
Layin' the tracks like a loco mo, spark the Jay

Chorus :
Tabla Rosa is my brain don't mean to bug or drive you insane
Don't have to guess just what I'm sayin if I had a point I'd say it plain
Dammit my brain is blank
And now I say it would be a lie if I said I was inspired
Nothin' to say but that's ok..

Nod your head to this

Messin' around, I'm not having it
You bite the hand I put your head out
I come to know a travesty and so sad to see
The scene dictated frustrated former musicians
Switching' the emphasis from art to money
But I demand autonomy what else my friend
I tell you what 's wrong to me the industry's ability to manufacture stars
They churn them out like Iwojema makes cars
But the blame lies not with those suits for trying
It's the sheep that keep on buying that soulless crap
Whatever they put in front of ya
The hysteria of America

Nod your head to this

Well, stress is the enemy and not a friend to me
One thing I see is to be easy goin' throwin' down sit back
And watch my life flowin' and knowing life is but a dream
You can ask my home team
Let me tell you how I seem
My economy seems to be in words not action actually ya see yes
I'm a tempest and I rarely rest but that's what you go to do
If you want to be the best so I'm on a threshold so don't tell me no
I just flow and know I can count on my bros

Chorus

Don't you know that the devil he's in me and God she is too
My Yin hates my Yang, but what the hell ya gonna do
I choose a rocky ass path but that's how I like it
Life's a bowl of punch go ahead and spike it

Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam

Say you'll get it baby just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft 
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life

And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last
And your streetcar visions which ya' place on the grass
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass
Who could they get to carry you?


Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And your basement clothes and your hollow face
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims
And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns
Who among them would try to impress you?


Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
And ya' wouldn’t know it woulda' happened like this
But a'who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And your Spanish manners and your mother’s drugs
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
Who among them do ya' think could resist you?


Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
How could they ever mistake you?
They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
How could they ever have persuaded you?


Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go
And your gentleness now, which you just can’t help but show
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you’re on his parole
With your holy medallion an' your fingertips now that fold
And your saintlike face and your ghost-like soul
Who among them could ever think it could destroy you?


Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Nightmare!
Now your nightmare comes to life


Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever 
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed 
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal 
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger


You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Oooooooh, it's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life


Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons 
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason 
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel 
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""


You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Oooooooh, it's your fucking nightmare
HA! HA! HA! HA!




Fight , not to fail , not to fall 
Or you'll end up like the others
Die , die again , drenched in sin 
With no respect for another
OH!
Down, feel the fire, feel the hate
Your pain is what we desire
Lost , hit the wall , watch you crawl 
Such a replaceable liar


And I know you hear their voices 
And I know they may seem real 
But our life's made up of choices 
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life


You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah

We trace our steps to a great unknown
Bury our toes where the ocean meets the sand
We hide ourselves right where we stand

Most intricate tongues of all time

Fastest, most accurate tongues ever heard in our lifetime

Act like a pencil, I'll fill you with lead
If you afraid, then tell me you scared

Who that? Who that? That's me
Who that? Who that? K-Dean

'I really be killin' a lot of you niggas, I'm mean'
Fuckin' with my niggas D-Loc and Dalima

A walking emotion, but nobody knows it
Nobody knows me
I'm lost and I'm caught in a cold dream
But they don't see that I'm walkin' around so boldly
'Cause nobody out there knows these
Thoughts in my mind, am I wastin' my time?
I know, I won't survive; hold me
'Cause I'm bleedin' to death
I got these holes in my chest
I feel like no one respects the fact that I'm up to my neck
I've done my best, but still, yet it seems like I'm out in the cold
Look at me froze; here on my own
Please, don't let me die here alone


I cannot face this alone
I can't get by on my own


Lost in the moment, life in a coma
Lyin' around, see my life getting colder
I'm alone, but I go nowhere
Living in a prison in my mind; so scared
I don't wanna be this way, nah

So you better get back on track; in other the words, I'm saying:
Give Him your pain, give Him your hurt

Making your money and going to work
You don't give it to God? You'll watch everything burn, yeah

And make sure they're shining on you

Promise you'll wait for me, wait for me
Wait 'til I'm home

Watched from far above them
However their history has just been changed

Rejoice for evermore, victor to the core

Checking out grounds for the next genocide

I'm just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squadered my resistance
For a pocketful of numbles
Such are promises, all lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest


When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know


Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there


Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home


In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still ramains

Day in the life of a baller
If the money was a lady 
I would have to call her, call her


Time to hit up my reception
So I drop down to a dimension
Sip Ace of Spades with a porcupine
Two hundred puppies and they all mine
Two million dollars worth of diamonds there
And I paid this dude just to stand there
All animated but it's me, yeah
So I smoked a bong with a reindeer
Gave me the key to the city
And zapped me back kinda quickly
Mama on stage, sippin' champagne
She knew me when I had no chains
Things that I bought so dignified
'Cause I had to snap it with Expensify
Party turned up but it just begun
Expenses paid!

Seems like every time I call you
I'm standing in the pouring rain
I had another falling out with love
I'm back out on the streets again
I could us a cup of coffee
But I guess I better pass this time
But you could do an old friend a favor
While I'm still on the line


I know you said it's over
But this old heart's still burning with desire
So tell me one more time
You don't love me anymore
You gotta help me girl
I can't put out this fire


It's good to hear your voice again
I can almost see your smile
It's good to talk about old times
If only for a little while
Guess I'll go on back to my place
There's not much else for me to do
I wish that I could close my eyes
Without dreaming of you




Oh you gotta help me girl
I can't put out this fire
No, no, you gotta help me girl
I can't put out this fire

"I built my house beside the wood
So I could hear you singing
And it was sweet and it was good
And love was all beginning

Fare thee well, my nightingale
'Twas long ago I found you
Now all your songs of beauty fail
The forest closes 'round you

The sun goes down behind a veil
‘Tis now that you would call me
So rest in peace my nightingale
Beneath your branch of holly

Fare thee well, my nightingale
I lived but to be near you
Tho' you are singing somewhere still

When your heart is all alone every second
Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those old clouds that rain so blue


But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you


When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone




So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At being on our own




The way I love you

As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David
And you always killed the beast


Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins
And the bodies at your feet


You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade

You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel



The smell of resigned leather
The sticky iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried
At the fencing master's call


He taught you all he knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance
On the screams of evil men


You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade

You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel

Collision, no use in running from
My senses picking up the pulse
The silence said a mouthful
Intuition, didn’t know what I was waiting for

Can’t go very far, gonna notice where you are
Got a love for you so large, fixed to you like a star
Can’t go very far, gonna notice where you are
Got a love for you so large, fixed to you like a star

Every time I think I got it figured
Something bigger always jumps in the frame
Something gets in the way

Now I’m ready to turn the page on yesterdays and forgive them
Now I’m willing to disengage to seize the day and move on

Wanna swing you higher
Wanna swing you higher

Vibration, coming up from the ground
Translation, something just more than sound
When I move on to the next world
I’ll wait for you over there
Rotation, my head the other way around


If I’m not careful I may
Slip away before I get
One last look at your face
You now I’ll see you again
Somewhere in another time and space

I do it the best, ya heard, I do it the best
Tuck the nine by my spine all the time
Stunt when I want a dead nigga, fuck with mine
My neck and my ear get to flicking like a strobe
My wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa
I'm the underground king, I reside on the throne
In the club wilding out over Henny and Patron
Me I'm in the zone, yeah me I'm in the zone
It's bottle after bottle til G-stacks are blown
Shawty in my ear like ''please take me home''
Before the next song, come on dawg, we gone
Off to the hotel, motel, the Holiday Inn
She said ''if I knew you worked the cat from the back like that
I would've brought my friend'' uh huh huh huh huh




I'm so raw, yeah, I'm so raw
Me I'm so ghetto, I'm oh so hardcore
I'm down by law, this style ya never saw
I give 'em just a little then watch 'em fiend for more
Yeah, they want more, they hot and they want more
They love the way I kick it, they addicted to your boy
I'm ecstasy, I'm the ultimate trip
I have ya in the morning like a dope fiend sick
Now feel the rush, I'm like pure cocaine
I have the whole night club going insane
No matter how rich I get I'm never gonna change
I will let it rain, push me, I let it rain
I do this shit myself, lawyer money ain't a thang
The unit is the gang, the yin and the yang
We went from poor to rich, now look we the shit
You best control your bitch or she'll be in the six
Uh huh huh huh huh




I'm fresh to death, I'm rocking the vest
I'm strapped moving 'round with the heat
I said I do it the best, I'm not the one you should test
That's why my name ring bells in the street
I put that work in, yeah yeah

We are the ones taking all the pain
Falling on our faces they don't care anyway
Anyway, now
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive
You're the one that pushes me all the time
All the time, now
We are hard at play
Always praised to do what they say
Calling me to rage
Feeling power, I must take its place some way


Never gonna run away seeking out my path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die I'm insane so dangerous
Don't you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins


We are the ones reaching out in vain
Trying to solve our problems they won't go away
Go away now
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive
You're the one that pushes me all the time

Calling me deranged

"Well, I hear that train a-comin'
It's rollin' around the bend
Well, I ain't seen the sunshine
Since I don't know when

And I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
Well, that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My mama told me, son
She said, always be a good boy
Don't never play with guns

But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

Well, I bet there's rich folks eatin'
From a fancy dining car
Well, they're probably drinking coffee
And smoking big cigars

Well, I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
Now, those people keep a-movin'
That's what tortures me

If they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all a little
Farther down the line

Yeah, far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
Lord, I here that whistle blowin'
Blow my blues away, yeah


It's been thirty years now, and I know I'll never leave this godforsaken place alive. Honest to God, when I hear her words ringin' through my head as loud as that old train whistle, crying out to me night after endless night, sending a cold steel shiver through my lost soul, I close my eyes and pray that that iron horse is bound for the promised land and I'll get to ride it home to glory someday

Shit, you mothafuckin' right!
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, west side! What?! Bring it on!


Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind


Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop


What?! I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas
Run, nigga, run! I'm on yo' ass, nigga
Run, nigga! Duck and hide
When I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga! Yeah, Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!


My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend


All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend


I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend


All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend


I love finger-fuckin' you, all of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just wanna be down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend


All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Me and my girlfriend

And that's alright
Just what I'm trying to say
In this fragile love of the way we found
Since you finally unwound
Just to be you
And do be down

I just wanna know
No matter where we go
Girl let's no destruct what we adore
Strange as it may sound
Let's keep this love around
You for me
Me for you
That's all I wanna do

Do be you
What everybody say to you all the time
To be true
Everybody wants but no one can find
To be loved
A human need that is never felt
Well baby I don't care
Just to be there
And do be down
Well baby I don't care
Please be there
And do be down
Well baby I don't care
Do be there
And do be down
Well baby I don't care
Do be down
And do be down
Well baby I don't care

Kick your shoes off in the corner
Mama, tuck them babies all up snug
Sis Draper's coming over
We all gonna cut a rug

When you see that lantern swinging yonder
Coming up the holler road
Them dogs'll get to barking
Ought to tie 'em all up with a rope

Now you boys better get in tune
Sis Draper's gonna be here soon
Don't shoot no dice or get too tight
If you're going to pick with Sis tonight

She come down from the Boston mountains
There was lightning in the air
Honey on them fiddle strings
Magnolia in her hair

She's a diamond in the rough
If you can't see the shine that's tough
Play all night for the likes of us
Sis Draper's got the touch

She'll play all night if she feels like it
Have some fruit punch if you spike it
Sis don't care who don't like it
See, Sis got a hell of a bow arm on her

She stepped up and sawed one off
And Uncle Cleve dropped his jaw
Said ""She's the best I ever saw
She must be from Arkansas""

I think Grandpa used to date her
Grandma says she still hates her
All the fellas stand up straighter
In the presence of Sis Draper


Sis Draper is the devil's daughter
Plays the fiddle Daddy bought her
Plays it like her mama taught her
She's a traveling Arkansawyer


She put her fiddle in a box
Said ""It's getting awful late""
She's on her way to Little Rock
And Little Rock can't wait

So we all stood out in the yard
Hands all full of watermelon
Watcher her leave, watched her go
Wishing I was in that wagon


Sis Draper is the devil's daughter
Plays the fiddle Daddy bought her
Plays it like her mama taught her
She's a traveling Arkansawyer

You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun


Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue


The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets


The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue


All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies are going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor


The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue


Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore


Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Slide to the right now a six-foot jump
Have fun
No time to run
The gun was itching so I tried to oblige
Now my head has no front
Dig your body up and then put it in my trunk
Drive out the lakefront
Throw your body into the waves
As I watch you float away I will light up my blunt


I live in a world of illusion
Confusing when aimlessly shooting
Couple slim bitches I'm spooning
That scarecrow you see moving
I'm gripping the ax with a pipe full of wax
Couple Xanax, gone throw them back
Fuck all the fame, bitch
I'm lucifer's sequel
They asking me why, why the fuck I hate people
They haters, they boring
Wondering why I ignore them
But get a little bit of shine and in a little bit of time
Every mother fucker gonna be waiting in line
For a chance to take you down
Fuck all y'all clowns
Hop off the dick of the $uicide clique
Triple six, it's fuck your god!

Girl there's something about the shine and the pop of your lip gloss
And all that high busting out of your tiny little tank top
I'm picking up every little bit of the tease you've been laying down



See I was headed to get a drink at the bar round the back
But you pumped the brakes on my Nikes, stopped them dead in their tracks
Flipped my snap-back back, spun a whole 180
Had to work up the nerve jus to tell you, baby


U turn, you turn the heat on
U turn every little bit of me on
A little drawl when you talk, little wiggle in your walk

Want to hold you all night

"Well I'm sitting in church
In an old wooden chair
I knew nobody
Would look for me there
. . . Sorrow and pity
. . . Rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothing
Anyone's eyes

Once I had pretty girls
Did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Snowflakes are falling
Around my head
Lord have mercy
It feel heavy like lead
. . . I been hit too hard
. . . Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch

Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Loneliness
Got a mind of its own
The more people around
The more you feel alone
. . . I'm chained to the earth
. . . Like a silent slave
Trying to break free
Out of death's dark cave

Once I had a pretty girl
Done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Boys in the street
Beginning to play
Girls like birds
Flying away
. . . I'm carrying the roses
. . . That were given to me
And I'm thinking about paradise
Wondering what it might be

Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Go over to London
Maybe gay Paree
Follow the river
You get to the sea
. . . I was hoping we could drink from
. . . Life's clear streams
I was hoping we could dream
Life's pleasant dreams

Once I had a pretty girl
But she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Well the weak get weaker
And the strong stay strong
The train keeps rolling
All night long
. . . She looked at me
. . . With an irresistible glance
With a smile
That could make all the planets dance

Once I had a pretty girl
She did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

My house is on fire
Burning to the skies
I thought the rain clouds
But the clouds passed by
. . . When I'm gone
. . . You'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame

Once I had a pretty girl
But she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

I weeped and moaned over his grave and to me boys it was sad
'Cause I knew down beneath that mound lay the best pal I ever had

Oh de lady a, de oh lady oh, de ladie

My best pal was my old paint horse and now he's gone to rest
I laid him down beneath that mound in Texas away out West
Where the cactus blooms over his grave and the coyotes cry
I know he sleeps in perfect peace beneath the Texas sky

My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does, and like my teachers would say
""Little black boys have a place in the world
Like hanging from trees, or dead in the street""
Like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies, I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end


I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark, I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave, gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb, refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey, see your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money, don't care to cater to merit
Y'all fetishizing my spirit, I see your culture’s dependent
On what you didn’t inherit, won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant

Seen someone proposing on stage
I couldn't get through my song for you
When it came to saying your name

Pretty painted tile
I can still see your skin turning purple
Lily of the nile


Can you hear me?

Did you plan it out?
Or was it an accident?


Time, time, up and down the blue screen, it's dawn and I'm insane
Love's just a word & not what the word means but I'll say it just the same
Talking to an entity, made of endless night

I know it don't work that way
But maybe you'll come back some day
I know it don't work like that
But maybe you can take it back


Now that there's no need to say a word
Can I still make amends?
But silence was the only kindness I heard
And forgiveness, the only revenge

Meeting all of the people
I've heard of from your past
Reading through all of your letters
Looking for your laugh


You told that me love
Is when someone asks you
Please leave me alone

Reflex in the sky
Warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you better hide
From the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky
Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay
Radiation, minds decay


Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun
Fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation
Victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
Like electric funeral pyre


Buildings crashing down
To earth’s cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood
Ice melt into blood
Earth lies in deathbed
Clouds cry for the dead
Terrifying rain
Is a burning pain






And so, in the sky
Shines the electric eye
Supernatural king
Takes Earth under his wing
Heaven's golden chorus sings
Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to Hell
Ever trapped in burning cells

I soaked the label off a Flintstone's Jelly Bean jar
I cleared us off a place on that one little table that you left us

I pulled the head off Elvis
Filled Fred up to his pelvis

The King is gone, and so are you


'Round about ten we all got to talkin'
About Graceland, Bedrock and such
The conversation finally turned to women
But they said they didn't get around too much

And Fred said, ""Old-fashioned girls are fun""

The King is gone, and so are you


Then later on it finally hit me
That you wouldn't be a-comin' home no more
'Cause this time I know you won't forgive me
Like all of them other times before


Then I broke Elvis's nose
Pourin' the last drop from his toes

I've spent, the last few years pouring gasoline on every bridge
Don't waste, your time on me
I keep on losing myself at sea
Don't try to hold me down, you know another one
It just can't last forever!
I need to leave this town
I feel like it my time, forgive me now or never!


I'm burning all these bridges
Cleaning my mind and burying my memories
So please don't wait for me...


Every day, I see my own life falling down!
I won't lie anymore to you!
That's the best I can do
One last time, let me start over
Just leave my name behind
And rewrite, on the tape of my life with a better mind


Don't try to hold me down
You are hearing the one I used to be
I'm far, from this town
I shut down my past, and threw away the key!


I feel I will never be the same!


I'm leaving for a long time
Losing myself and hoping, to get my clear sight
Before I lose my mind...


Every day, I see my own life falling down!
I won't lie anymore to you!
That's the best I can do
One last time, let me start over
Just leave my name behind
And rewrite, on the tape of my life with a better mind!


Here's my, deadline
And I'm not here to lie!
Now it's, my time!

Don't stick to the past, cause nobody moves on

"Stammi a sentire, ascolta un po
E dimmi se di ragioni non ne ho

Ma sono troppi quei momenti in cui non lo ricordi piu

No lamore questa sera no, son tropppo stanca e adesso dormiro
Tu leggi pure non disturbi sai
E una parola non ci scappa mai

Se vuoi parlare, ti ascoltero
E chissa quante cose nuove scopriro
Comicio io, cominci tu
Per iniziare a litigare o per non salutarci piu

No lamore questa sera no o domattina non mi svegliero
Casa vuoi dire solo il letto poi...

Un bacio in cui non ci si ritrova piu
Un po la noia, un po perche
Nussuno muove il primo passa ma lo lascia sempre a te

No lamore questa sera no sai che i bambini stanno sempre svegli

Ho un po caldo fatti un po piu in la

Sei come un fiore che non appassisce mai
Si puo salire, andare gui
Ma e un dovere ris vegliarsi e poi amarsi un po di piu

No lamore questa sera no
Stiamo abbracciati e chiacchieriamo ancora un po
Riscopriamo che ce un prima e un poi

But it might take a hundred sleepless nights
To make the memories of you disappear
But right now I can't see nothing through these tears


Control my thoughts
Convincing myself it's your loss
I really mean it
And I'm starting to believe it

To make it feel like you were never here

You cried on my shoulder

Who's to say what's impossible?
Well they forgot, this world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything

And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity


I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you

Yeah, it's overdue right here
Y'all know what it is..


The dead is gone, the world welcomes new borns
A thousand-bookies is sworn in uniform
No applications for snitches, niggas, but you can join
Just get your coins, and start droppin' dime
Superiority, I can stop time
And I am the minority, so who can knock mines?
Purposely placed here on purpose to shine
Home, purchased on furnace, my concerns is to grind
Get some M's, then gettin' to win
And transfer all U.S. currency for yen
A few friends, few next to kin
Yes it's true, I flew through in that fluorescent Benz
Show room shoppin', coppin' rims, I'm top-ten
Niggas gon' respect my pen
Survived in two droughts, two separate games
So I shout, ""Who'll slouch, get outta my lane""
My homey's homey did ten an change
So we set-up in Tony's rome, and I picked out his brain
I explained it's bigger game then just street nigga fame
Them same thoughts I fought like Sugar Shane
Reachin' the next chapter of life after I mastered
Fuck it Fresh, address these little bastards


Uh, yea, yeah
I'm reachin' for the Range doors on the truck
The European stitch strong in the guts
My nigga M3's doors liftin' up
Uh, Fresh sick with dough, got Danbury pictures goin' off the dust
And the Cranberry Six growin' off the guts
Light pink heavy wit strong off the cuts
Actin' like steady bitch, knowin' you a slut
And after we get finished ma knowin' you won't cut
And you know I'm in the truck, and deep dishin' it
Fives and sixes, the kid keep kickin' shit
Pies of the bricks, the kid keep flippin' shit
I insist the stag' and seen different shit
Bubble face your par' wit see fish in it
Bubble great, ponair's wit clean kinesh shit
In Duffle bags by Guc'
The white double-stitch on the whore that's Emilio Puc'
Flow Rivers in the booth and I'm speakin' the truth
So listen up, young niggas cuz I'm speakin' perfuse
Uh, yea


The bigger it is nigga, the harder it falls
Niggas scared of LL, nigga give us the ball...
Listen to this man
I want ya'll to listen real close and real careful man
There ain't seldom is niggas born wit all the five senses
The five senses are now, listen to this and listen to this shit close
Cuz this is when a nigga is a last level nigga
First of all, you had to been born wit automatic understanding of the game
You had to have be born with automatic understanding of the game from birth
Then you gotta be unadulterated orator
You gotta know how to spit that dialogue in some form of fashion
Whether it's just talking or it's rapping
Then you gotta be a law of inertia
Mean that once you get in motion, and you get focused
You get hot, that you cannot be motherfucking stopped
Then on top of that you gotta have lyrical sense on a massive level
Some niggas got it on minor, some niggas got it on major
Some niggas got it on the master, master is the last level
Then on top of that it gotta be written in your script
The script... the script... the script...
Yo real niggas you can't break
And real nigga you can't make 'em man
We've been big niggas all of our life man
Answered to nobody man, and wake up
And go wherever the day take us man

"Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill

Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill

I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill

Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill

We'll be understood 'cause you're the truth

Can see if there's a rain drop falling away
But if your words get suddenly blurred
You 'member that the truth is always worth, seeing


You're like a firebird in the sky
Shining for a challenger in the night
Just like a firebird, is your heart
Keeps me warm and anchory in the stars
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird


Courageous wings make things go far
Lingering solitude can rip them off
So let the wind cross your ash thoughts
Giving you the strength to carry on

Can see if there's a rain drop falling away
But if your words get suddenly blurred

When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
And there's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
I got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone and I think of losing you


I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon
If you lose your one and only
There’s always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon


I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadow of that smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart
He’ll come back someday


Oh, but I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon




The jukebox plays on drink by drink
And the words to every sad song seem to say what I think
And this pain inside of me
It ain't never gonna end
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon


Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There’s always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon


Oh, if you lose your one and only
There’s always room here for the lonely

Photoshoot, 4-door coupe
Polo boots, turnt up through the roof
Me gon' hit my boots, then she hit my boots
Told her I was thirsty, she say ""she had that juicy""
She's willing and I'm able
I told her ""I'll see you later""
So many horses in my closet
Makes my shit look like a stable
Crib like a zoo, all types of gators
His and her, fox furs, all types of flavors
This is not a Boxster, this a Panamera
I've been serving dick,you can check my clientele
My wrist costs a bail, my charm costs a chicken
And every time you see me
You can tell I'm fucking getting it
I used to wear the skippers
I'm polo'd to the zipper
I used to shop at Macy's
When it used to be Riches 
I used to it and you useless
So know the fucking difference
And fuck with one of mine
Somebody gonna end up missing




I sag too low, lift them up let the boot show
Leather dark red, the same color as Nuvo
Wrist hugging that Hublot, my pockets huge though
Denim TRU clothes, get worn out like a used ho
Polo, high boo, like ""Hi boo""
Yeah I'm fly, cute in that hard top suicide coupe
Cannon on me while bumping that Trapavelli II
Slime Flu, coughing on niggas, must I remind you?
I'm used to this city noise, of pretty boys
Fatter that Diddy's boys, Magic City wit Tity Boi
Silly boy, I make classics, Reebok 54's
With my whole crew, lo boots, like give me 50 more
Conjure for Bonjour, whore
Hop out the four-door with four broads
Look like The Law
It may be Juicy Couture, I bag them all
I had a mall, swagger tall
And I just happen to ball




I dive in that wet, call me Micheal Phelps
Louis logo, check a boy's belt
501s, mind on my money
Look at the tongue, these boots looking like diamonds
Pockets on Goliath and your pockets on a diet
OK, alright I try it, if I like it then I'll buy it
Except for some pussy, OK you're right, I'm lying
Cause if that pussy good, Imma motherfucking buy it
And yeah I'm from the city where these bitches get tipsy
Niggas smoke strong, on the phone and talk riches
Righteous prices, baking soda vices
And yeah I'm in a new car, and I don't have a license
Your girlfriend like it, I met her on tour
And every time she sees me, she calls me Ralph Lauren
Imma Ralph Lauren story, Ralph Lauren mansion
And when it gets cool
I wear my Ralph Lauren jacket

"The door it opened slowly
My father he came in, I was nine years old
And he stood so tall above me
Blue eyes they were shining
And his voice was very cold
Said, ""I've had a vision
And you know I'm strong and holy
I must do what I've been told.""
So he started up the mountain
I was running, he was walking
And his ax was made of gold

Well, the trees they got much smaller
The lake a lady's mirror
We stopped to drink some wine
Then he threw the bottle over
Broke a minute later
And he put his hand on mine
Thought I saw an eagle
But it might have been a vulture
I never could decide
Then my father built an altar
He looked once behind his shoulder
He knew I would not hide

You who build the altars now
To sacrifice these children
You must not do it anymore
A scheme is not a vision
And you never have been tempted
By a demon or a god
You who stand above them now
Your hatchets blunt and bloody
You were not there before
When I lay upon a mountain
And my father's hand was trembling
With the beauty of the word

And if you call me brother now
Forgive me if I inquire
""Just according to whose plan?""
When it all comes down to dust
I will kill you if I must
I will help you if I can
When it all comes down to dust
I will help you if I must
I will kill you if I can
And mercy on our uniform
Man of peace or man of war
The peacock spreads his fan

"The tall weeds lay flat down
On the hard flat Kansas ground
And a sad song in her head
Kept blowin' round

She barely even knew his name
But she liked the way he played the game
Everybody cheered
When he scored that last touchdown...

Indian Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

Tangled in a moment of truth
Bottle of wine in a motel room
Blue haze circled 'round
The cold gray moon

While the wind chased the leaves outside
Passion found a place to hide
Late September heat
Couldn't be denied

Oh Indian Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

She never even finished school
People like to talk, they can be so cruel
Heard California was a place
To start brand new

So she left that dust bowl town
Sometimes when a long wind howls
I wonder where we'd be
If I never scored that last
Touchdown

The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder

To wash my confusion clean

We acted out, we wear the colors
Confined by the things we own
We're not without, we're like each other
Pretending we're here alone
And far away they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done

See his strong hands
But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
See the drunk man, try to ask him why
He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie

Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin

Staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
See I prayed every day for a change to be made
And I'd wait to be saved, oh no
Up at night, hiding under covers found my escape
Shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
See I knew I was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing


I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it


Then the universe aligned
With what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls?


Now I wake up to a different bedroom everyday
Living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
Used to sit and watch paint dry
Amazed by the limelight
I can't ever be afraid


I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it


Then the universe aligned
Oh, with what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls?
Oh, the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls


All of the days that I wasted gazing outside the window
Impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
Lied awake at night while my head wandered
And I wondered why
Things weren't different
Everything shifted overnight
Went from ""when boredom strikes"" to ""Ms. Star on the Rise""
It was all in an instant man
But those four pink walls, now I kinda miss them man


Then the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls

Those four pink walls

This is the first time in a long time
That I've felt like coming home for the holidays
Everybody's rushing about
Why won't anybody hear me out?


My money's low
So instead I'll write you a song everyone will know
Everyone will know

That is all
About you
Lets drop everything
And not come back 'til next fall
Everyone knows that you've got me
Right where you want me to be

And the long nights
Driving around with your friends in your parents car

I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye


You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway


My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?


You're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy

Saying that I love him but I know I'm gonna leave him

Stopped to see how high and how far we'd gone

In a song is a song
In a life is a light
If it's wrong, then it's wrong
If it's right, then it's right
Chasing a jewel under the sun
Is a fool and his fun
And if death is the debt
Then he'll die when he's young
Life is such a school of roses
Hocus pocus and carousels
Very well
Fair thee well, fairy tale
If we fall, then we fall
When we fight for what's right
Then it's wrong when it's wrong
And it's right when it's right
If it's wrong when it's wrong
Then it's right when it's right


By the Way
Some thing's gotta change
They're taking what we live for
Find a Way
To break all the chains
The ceiling is the new floor


Very well, fair thee well, fairy tale
Is what I tell myself
Moving on, through the storm, staying calm
I gotta watch my health
Friend or foe, I don't know, let it go
Because the Lord's my help
Ya the Lord's my help
I'm never by myself


By the Way
Some thing's gotta change
They're taking what we live for
Find a Way
To break all the chains
The ceiling is the new floor


When the blind lead the blind
How you ever gon' know when it's time
Cause time is only special when you take it in
If you cherish every moment it'll never end
And when the future disappears
All your memories will become crystal clear
If I can, you can
Make the world a better place
I know that God can
I'm just tryna keep the faith
Oh by the way


By the Way
Some thing's gotta change
They're taking what we live for
Find a Way
To break all the chains
The ceiling is the new floor


By the Way
It's never gonna change
If we don't know what to live for
Right Away
I'm making a change
So I can learn to love more

""My son ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee""


Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander


At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia


Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend amongst mortal men


King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria


By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia


Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a God amongst mortal men


A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia


Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on


The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory


Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon

I lie on a sofa awake
It's what you said last night
You'd like us on top of a cake
But you won't let me take a bite


Flowers arriving in fleets
Can't we talk about this?
Why let the State in our sheets?
Can't we do without it?


Well, I don't mean to wind you up
But I'd like to slow it down
How do I remain a pup?
If you put me in a gown?


What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?
What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?


Corners begin to repeat
I think we're getting lost
We walked to the end of the street
But we were bitten by the frost


So if you have to thaw me out
You can put me in a pail
Can we take another route?
I don't want to wear a veil


What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?
What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?


I'll wait in the lobby for someone to show
And if they don't come, I will know where to go
The bodies are lined up outside in the hall
I don't want to decay in a mall


If everything you say is true
Then why would I disagree?
How can I lose control...?


What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?

Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? , can they stop me? 
Tryna sell 4 million copies 
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we comin' from
Life as an Outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise

Don't stop


I got 58 ways to get out of the game
But only one way's gonna fit my name; Hussein
Ride by, with the block, I can't stop

Yo, I broke nights to get big, gettin' rope spot's hold it tight

Runnin' with fat blunts niggas ain't rollin' right

Senseless, relentless in every sentence but above that

Insane iller than caine, Uzi cops, then watch 'em fear ya
Who's next?
I'm ready to check a neck in a second

Gripin' the TEC and slap' ya head because I snap under pressure
Cuttin' circulation
Stranded on the plant the earth's chasin'

I guess right now you've got the last laugh


I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here


Tell me they love it, they want me, they need me
Surrounded inside of this room by the gritty
It seems like these women is needy
But all they've been wantin' and needin' is money
She callin' me honey, I know that she lyin'
And all she want from me is everything high end
The ladder, the ladder, she love it, she climbin' above it
The higher she gets, she gets no vision from it
The second she plummet she gon' be right here
The second she plummet she gon' be right here
At the bottom with killers and dealers
Now they say that diamonds forever but never explain
That the diamonds fillin' up your safe cannot fill up the pain
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here


Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

To give you strength and build you up when you are down

Lost in seclusion there
Like I was in a cell, a captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control
Down on the streets below, bright city lights would glow
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze, still counting empty days
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break this spell?


Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night


Then one night as I walked, I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar
Oh, how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this


Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night

Baby when I told you, you're the only one I like
I meant to say, I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight
And baby when I told you, you're the sunshine of my life

When I told you I like you for everything you are
I meant I like the way your titties sit up in your bra
Everything I said in your ear by the bar
Was just to get you in the back seat of my car
You're an inspiring actress, girl you could go far
If you knew who I knew, baby you would be a star
But when I told you, you had sexy lips
I meant to say I bet you suck a good dick
And when I said I was feeling ya hips
I meant to say, I bet she like it like a dog and shit
So tell me doc, am I really sick?
When bitches find out how I think, they say I ain't shit

When I said I miss you, I mean I ain't hit in a while
I was thinking I come over, I'm thinking I can knock you down
When I said just kiss it, I mean come on just suck me off
I said I'll take you shopping, I meant I'll drive you to the mall
I wanna keep in touch, you know I hardly ever call
I'm doing big things, but I like my money short
You lookin' good baby, I complement you on your clothes
I mean them jeans ya wearing, I can't wait to take 'em off
I bet I get ya hot, I mean hotter than a stove
I'll be ya freak, ya freak, yeah I'll lick ya I suppose
I mean from your neck, all the way down to your toes

Put ya legs back, and hop on you like a frog
Get religious quick, have you saying my god

"Cotton candy was king
On the midway that spring
When I saw you in the ring on the lawn

Dear John
Throwing kisses so Richmond's unfortunates can go on

Oh, the lectures I gave
So the girls would behave
While the band played all your favorite songs

Dear John
Throwing kisses so Richmond's unfortunates can go on

But numbers come up and you're left to the fates
Though I always thought you were one of the greats
Once somebody stationed in Kuala Lumpur
Said he thought you went out, but he couldn't be sure

And the midway I knew
Where the sky was so blue
With the memory of you is gone

Dear John

I found god
I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake

I found the devil
I found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerines
In his color-coded speak


Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets


I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down


I found a martyr
He told me that I'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs

I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine


Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

Fucked me mentally, pussy was fire that shit made me pause

Snow white too, wanted to get rocked

Oh baby you so fire, more like hellfire

Bitch watch out I'm about to conspire
He told me to kill you, cause your life I shall acquire
Cause Satan says, you're making him perspire
Which is why your torment is required
Cause deep down in hell, there is no purifier
Cause golden goddess you'd be the perfect qualifier
Your soul burning I shall always admire
Cause the heat you release gets me inspired
To kill the rap game until the day I expire

It's tragic
I'm blowing on this endo
That's a 10-4

Nothing but plastic
Give a fuck about this rap shit
Killing myself with military tactics

Off this burning exhaust
All this flossing made my teeth hurt
You can find me sitting by myself on the top of the fucking bleachers
Fuck the game motherfucker

Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me

Your bitch just chose me
We can handle this like we got some class or
Get into the gangster shit if you tripping low-key
Women is never nothing to steal
When you making hella bread and you go from here to Brazil
So you gotta know I'm the nigga that she wanna get to for big thrills for real


Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
'Cause I see you choosing
You know I hold it down
Even though I came a long way from the blocks
Still wave my finger to the cops
I see you like what I got
So let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
I see you choosing

"Talking to Mary
You know you don't have to shout
She can hear what you're thinking
Like you were saying it right out loud

It's you she sees behind
That dirty look
It was her that followed down
Every stupid turn that you took

One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so

Saw the one big problem
You keep under your hat
And it's pretty unlikely
That anybody else will be cool with that

You got bus fare in your pocket
And more money down in your sock
But she can't tell you how to contact her
If you won't listen to her talk

One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so

It's no problem, I'll just keep quiet
If it's easier for you
To make believe then
That I don't love you as much as I do

One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so
I told you so
I told you so

"Souljah
Everytime I read your letters it makes me smile, think, laugh, and marvel at how easy it is 4 us 2 relate to one another  It is my wish that when this letter reaches you it finds you and your family in safety and serenity. Now, where do I start? I'm sitting here with a fat stack of letters and through them all I immediately recognize your handwriting and know that you finally written me back and as usual it was worth the wait. This letter is hard to write because I'm editing as I write. I'm preoccupied with having any of my statements misjudged as ""hustling""! :) First of all, let me answer your questions. #1. No, I don't mind long letters in fact I wish yours were longer and yes I would love to not only hear of your adventures but also share some of my own. Yes, I will write a book. Right now I'm writing 3 screenplays so upon my release I can recoup from my losses. Instead of complaining about bad movie roles or negative stereotypes I'm writing my own visions. As far as the book is concerned, I am working on doing an Autobiography but if it is at all possible I want us to do a book together. That would truly be the ""BOMB""! Let me just tell you ever since I've read your book it has been going from person to person like a bible. Everybody from male inmates to female inmates have been reading it. I get a sense of pride at being the person to turn them on to your literary talents. Plus, I use your book with the women in my life. I have asked two females to read it and we use each chapter as a door to our own lives. Like the chapter on Nikki is my favorite. I was trying over the past few months to this female in my life why it was so hard 4 me 2 trust her regardless of how sweet and innocent she portrayed herself to be and only after reading that chapter did she finally understand. This is some personal shit but I feel as though I can trust you so.... Okay there's that chapter where you were contemplating sharing this man with another woman. I'm in that position now. I love one woman  because she's dependable, loving, supportive, and she's young and open to me guiding her through this crazy life  Anyway woman ""A"" is from the streets and that's all she knows but I can see and feel how much she loves me. Woman ""B"" on the other hand is famous, rich, and able to assist me financially, loving, and very sexual. She's known me since before I got into the business and she's been there from the jump. However, she's bisexual and so into her career that we don't have much time together. So I'm literally torn between an old friend who went from being of a platonic nature to a potential wife and a new friend who has been there through the whole gunshot/rape/near death experience. I have rejected them both but then reconsidered and got 'em both back. They know of the other and I have tried to make it work as a threesome. Not sexually but commitment wise. Had I not read your book I would have continued living and juggling with all of these other women but between them both I completely satisfied. I've always felt that when I love someone it is so intense that I drive them away but with ""A"" and ""B"" it evens everything out. I can satisfy both of them and not because I'm a ""Supermanlove"" but because I truly love them both and the intensity and passion I feel for them keeps me driven to please them. Can u feel me? It's hard to explain on paper maybe when you visit me I can elaborate which brings me to my next step. Yes I would love 4 u 2 come visit me there isn't a list but there are certain days and times for each inmate. I'll attempt to reach you by phone to make it happen. Now back to me controlling my sexual desires. Now be honest, as a woman, how could you love a man that couldn't satisfy you? Since men are born totally inept sexually we only learn how 2 please a woman from pleasing a woman. So as rotten as it seems practice makes perfect. Every woman I have been with has not only taken what I learned from the last woman but taught me and prepared me for the next and since I am not married and yet to find the perfect woman you described I am forever in search of her. I have been with many married women from wives of powerful drug lords to the wives of broke everyday Joes to the wives of quite a few very famous and rich singers/actors and seeing their wives hungry for someone else has shown me that only by being able to completely satisfy a woman in every way, shape, and form can I truly find a happy and trusting faithful relationship. Now to answer your other questions. My health is fine I truly feel blessed that other than mentally I have no scars or lasting problems from my ""ordeal"". I still have the complete use of every nerve, limb, and muscle and more surprisingly I can still make love and have babies after taking a shot to my scrotum! Talk about faith in God! :)! Mentally however the helpless feeling never leaves me. I can't sleep! I wake up sweaty and disorientated when I do doze off and I will never erase the faces of my attackers from my mind. 2 be honest the bullets didn't hurt much not at first but afterwards it was painful. I didn't feel the shots in my head, hand, scrotum but because of all the muscles involved the leg wound was a real bitch! I don't really have any gun phobias meaning if it happened again I would react the same way. The pain came as I lay in the hospital thinking about the fact that some ""Thug"" brothers shot me. Then to hear I was found guilty of something I had not done plus wondering if my family was safe SCARED ME! Even with 5 gunshot wounds my paranoid ass was still sleeping with a 12 gauge and a Glock. I never planned to turn myself in I planned on shooting it out but upon further reflection I realized I owed alot to my people. Although I would have been at peace, the misery of our folks would continue. Besides I'm a Soldier and Soldiers use strategy not emotion no matter how bad the odds!

Ayy, another day waiting for death
Every day that I waste on my list of regrets, so I tell myself
""It's okay, day after next, we'll make all these arrangements to change—you can better yourself""
I know I'm wasting my breath as I inhale
I know I'm escaping my death as I inhale
I, I can't recall why I'm suffocating
My lungs are failing


How can I
Forgive you?
Oh my God!


Step into the mind of a Cut Throat
Empty streets, cold weather, all alone
Blackness, grey air, just snow
Feelings low, being followed by crows
Call list overflowed with hotlines
Drug help, mental, $uicide
Feel tired, feel dried, and you wanna die
Pride fried, closed eyes, and you start to cry
Swear I spent a lifetime tryna get it right
Still isolated, still outta sight
Keep my dreads swingin' like they in a fight
I just wanna kill everyone in sight
Take the money, take the bitches, take the drugs, take the gold
Baby, let me decompose
Never names said, more shade spit
I'ma see you one day, that's a promise

Forgive you?

There's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
A lack of sleep poundin' in my head
We both regret some of the things we said
But we love the way it ends


Sometimes I think
We hurt each other just because of where it'll lead
And sometimes I think
We're fighting just to be lovers and all so needlessly


Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight


They say don't go to bed angry, that's true
But it's really something when we do

White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?


Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack


Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives


Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

What goes on in the mind of a bad boy? Nothin' but payback
Who's next, the clip, callin' murder conducting the contract
Better watch your back
Since he's makin' that comeback
The 1-87 will stop 'em
The hollow point, will drop ya
Go on, here's a scene for your soul
So take heed when you meet face-to-face, here comes the grim reaper
You best to profit from the depths of hell
He's a real McCoy
But ain't no stoppin' this girl is bad boy
He ain't no joke
Muthafucka grab your throat
Before you find yourself cut with a blade
As your bloody body lays on top of cement
In front of your president
It was a murder for hire
Hit an innocent child in the crossfire
Now he's confined to a jail
Got shot six times, in his spine
But his mind is still down at the grind
He's willin' to destroy
That's what he lives for, to be a bad boy

Runnin' 'round tellin' these niggas, how they gon' capture me
It's gettin' crazy, it's hard to make my mind up
Now should I, buck 'em down, or put my nine up?
You see, I ain't a bad boy, just a boy who had it bad
I graduated from 22's to 3-57 mags
Runnin' on these marks 'fore they stashin'
I ain't askin', give it up, or get to blastin'
The penitentiary don't scare me
A straight thug nigga, the whole set'll take care of me
And tell me, who the fuck you gon' find
Rough enough to tear these bitch-niggas, this is mine
Now busta, meet my nine, 24 on the grind
I'm sick about mine, and uh, ain't nothin' wrong with gettin' high
A hustlin'-ass nigga from the projects, I'm makin' loot
And screamin' Thug Life, nigga, when I shoot

Now how many bad boys in the house
So hurry boys got the bigger nuts
What the fuck, I gave 'em the blunts
Havin' a grudge against the whole fuckin' world
A 16 shot-block-Glock, that'll stop 'em
They're sure to hit the ground
Nothin', bustin' a cap on no more every round
A bad boy is the big, shot on the block
He got knots, bigger rocks for the cops
Before he gets props
So you petty boys, you can't fuck with 'em
You can eat the biggest good friend
Or become a victim of a dead man
It's sad to see, when you end up six-feet deep
So rest in peace, muthafucka, join the pow
He got nothin' but the realest style
Flavors when on the mic
And packin' the meal like life
Savers, sweep up on you at night
His grip on tight, and make you take a bite
That's all she wrote, barrel went down your throat
Killin' off these niggas for fun
Murder one, and throw away your gun
He's livin' his life like a soldier
That's what he lives for, to be a Bad Boy


Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?

Up so high in my tree
Living off of Wonderland
Living with an unknown band
Waiting there for Everyman

There was change in the air
It was love everywhere

Ankle deep in contraband
Working on a life unplanned

Didn't we believe in love?
Didn't we believe in giving it away?
That didn't really leave us with the love
To find our way
After RFK and Martin Luther King

Do you feel it today?
Love is still on the way
Coming over wonderland
The world is in your open hand
Once again it's at your command

Didn't we believe that love would carry on?
Wouldn't we receive enough

When the lights have turned to grey
On the dawning final day
See the sun now fade away
Can we find the words to say
All the times we fought in vain
Though the years and seasons change
But we all still feel the same
As we stand before the world


Feel the engines fire
Feel the thunder rise
Now touch the path of glory
Power to the turbo drive
Hot wheels of fire burn strong
Flash lightning fries the brain
On a course to no tomorrow
Driving all of us insane
City lights laid out before us
Go forth for now your time has come
Now your time has come


In a flash of blue steel, to the far horizons
Supersonic power, on the wings of a dream
Down the roads so far, with nowhere to hide
Like a star shooting right from the sky
Slow down for no one, never look back now tonight


Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion


500 miles an hour
All gravity defied
We touched the taste of glory
So close the finish line
Bright lights still glare before us
Give it up for now your time has come
Now your time has come


Like a demon on wheels, through the cursed blue mountains
Don’t let a minute go by, give it all till the end
On a one way street living in the fast lane
Feel the passion that runs through your veins
Faster with fury to the end of all our days


Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion


We live for the night
We long for the day
The glory forever
Forever we fight aside from the knight locked out in space, hey




A lifetime of dreaming
But don't ever stop believing
The passion, the fight deep inside
The power before me
I'm sent to the edge of glory
Tonight, shooting, fall across the sky


Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion
Oblivion
Woah, woah, woah

Junior year you were A's and B's
Right on track, homecomin' queen
But the day we met
You had your heart set on that badboy thing
And your daddy swore I was trouble
So, I snuck you out to cuddle up
Next to me in that middle seat
We'd roll backroads, hold hands, and sing


We were Romeo and Juliet
Breakin' out in a sweat
Makin' out in the bed
Of a beat up truck
Slap covered in mud
You swore I was lyin'
I swore I was stuck
By the bare footprint on a fogged up window
A big ol' heart around our initials
We told all our friends
That it was love
And it was love
At least we thought it was


You had to wait 'til you turned 18
Earned that ring
Hit one knee
Just like we planned
Tried our hand at that old runaway thing
And I didn't know where I was goin'
But I remember your hair was blowin in the wind
I just knew it then
That what we had would never end


We were Bonnie and Clyde
Rollin' 95
Burnin treads on the tires
Barely a dime
Both our names musta gone insane
Thinkin' we'd get somewhere on half a tank
On the side and at the end of our road
With just enough cash to get you home
We believed all we'd ever need was love
And we had love
At least we thought it was


Love at first sight
I remember that first night
What a beautiful girl
But I grew up and now I see
It just wasn't meant to be
I think it was us against the world


We were Romeo and Juliet
Breakin' out in a sweat
Makin' out in the bed
Of a beat up truck
Slap covered in mud
You swore I was lyin'

Yea, yea, yea yea, like photos in my mind, you the vision in my dreams, and what I see is perfect, I picture you my queen. staring at your
Finger got me picturing the ring, you my 50 inch plasma the picture in my screen, but something ain't adding up, my math ain't equaling, you looking for the love, im selfish with my feelings eh. pushing for commitment im running from commitment, scared to open up and you wonder why im distant, trying to push away, youre the only one that knows me, feelings in the air. im afraid you might expose me, I don't mean to leave you heartbroken sleepless but im scared to give you my heart and you keep it



Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

Lonely, on me nobody ever shut down it down like you
You want a crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me
You know that I'll always be in love with you right til the end OOh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's bound to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
We'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail 'do
I used to be all on it like a fly to shit
Back in the days, Bonita was a hit
I flirted and I flirted 'til there was no end
But you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
Honey, you was funny but I'm tired of that
It's three years later, I got a new rap
You got a little older, a titbit wiser
I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
Speaking of high I saw you smoke a hootie mack
Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back
But I'm here to testify it'll be a hard try
Slapping my knees, letting out sighs
Want to keep it slamming like a hip-hop song
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

In the words of the immortal Sweet Daddy 


I'll never shed a tear but then again I won't steer
You wrong, I steer you strong, for affection steer here
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the Uno
What do you know, if we go to El Segundo
Your presence should be closer like on ""Buddy"" I'll toast
To the ever clever youth, to say the least, you're the most
Honey, you're my honey, a-yo, dip, you're my dip
Treasure and forever there'll be pleasure with Tip
As we glide and move
Cushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth
Ricky D said we got to ""show and prove""
Do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove
Intimidate the boy
Cupid that's his name
Picking all us suckers is his flipping game
But Tip don't fall for that
Instead I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest
Lambskin store, get a six-pack of hats for

Throw me a cigarette, dawg!
They got me feelin' crazier than a motherfucker
I got Bad Azz in this motherfucker
Makaveli the Don, representin' the Outlawz
Bad Azz representin' the LBC Crew
So whatcha wanna do? Y'know how we do it


Puffin' on loud
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Oh yeah, I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Oh yeah, I feel crazy



Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me for the outcome, ban my records – check it
Don't have to bump this, but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
Rollin' in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way, but still I got so far to go
Dear Mama, don't worry, I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak – all I heard was…


Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy



I see Bloods and Crips runnin' up the hill
Lookin' for a better wayyy
My brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
‘Cause even thug niggas prayyy
Hopin' God hear me, I entered the game
Look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent – casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this yo land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin' time fly, I love my people, do or die
But I wonder why we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, ""Nigga, get paid!""
No one can understand me – the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say… 


Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy
I feel crazy 


God, help me out here, ‘cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
‘Cause money's like a strong prescription
Drug, it's got me addicted
To the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin' about the paper
With the pictures of the president's head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money ‘cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So I gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life do 'em right or did life leave 'em dumb?
Who has the answers? I wonder, I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
 ‘Cause they don't even know
A million things run through my mind
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time



Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy


I feel fucked up in this bitch
I smoked half a ounce to the head
Chocolate Thai, indo, Hawaiian, lambsbread, buddha
All that shit!
I'm fucked up in this motherfucker
And Hennessy don't help
And Hennessy don't help
Thug Passion in this muh'fucker
Makaveli the Don puttin' it down to the fullest
Maximum overload
3 Day Theory, Killuminati to your body
With the impact of a 12 gauge shotty
Double-I slugs, no love, straight thugs


One time for my niggas in the jail cell

One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell

One time for my niggas in the jail cell 
One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell

Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Has someone taken your faith?

You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
Your trust, you must confess

Is someone getting the best

I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven


Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears


I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears


Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears


Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears


Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come


Lord! 
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers


And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor

Hmm, like LL, I’m in too deep with it
Little momma pussy so good, man, that I almost fell asleep in it




Aye, my nigga, come get yo bitch, she out my traphouse stalkin’
Panamera on the Forgies, I’m flossin’, 458 with the horsie
I got that packet from Cali, I can break it down
And have everything gone by the mo’ning
Have the amigo pull up with 1000 meetings
I can run through yo city like Jordan
Nigga, my cousin, my women imported
Yo, bitch on my bumper, you can get extorted
I call my plug and I tell him bring me more
Don’t worry bout me, worry bout where yo ho at
Nigga, yo bitch outside my traphouse skeetin’
Bitch outside, she stalkin’
285, just ride, smokin’ precious, you trippin’, I left that bitch walk in
I got these racks so big I can’t fold it
I got yo bitch, yo shawty got ebola
We sellin’ that coke, we no call it a come up
Makin’ em G’s, ya gotta stay 100
That precious gas pack, we smoke it and punch in

"I'm not strong enough to stay away
Can't run from you, I just run back to you
Like a moth, I'm drawn in to your flame
Say my name, but it's not the same

And my soul surrenders, and you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

In order to fund various public expenditures
A failure to pay, along with evasion

You make over five hundred thousand a year
Sam want thirty-seven percent of that
Which is almost forty percent

Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight, in sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I wore the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises but who dares to pull the strings


I know this may be hard for you to believe and all
But you only exist because we allow it


I've questioned all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?


By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem a stunningly short time


You've been beaten down time and time again
But still you find yourself at the center of it all

Are they mine or have I been misled?

""The good part about is, we get to show the human side of cops doing what they do
Cause, it's always been my belief that cops are just a gang themselves- with the good and the bad
Like I believe the gang bangers on the street got both good and bad like the police officers do
They got stress and they got character flaws that come from their lifestyles

I could be the best actor that anybody seen
Given the chance, the opportunity, and the experience and the lessons from people, I could be the best...
But right now I don't wish to the best, I just want to be one of them

If you look at it from a stereotypical point of view, like how people say, you know
'All your troubles with the law, how can you play a cop?'
Just from a stereotypical point of view
Who could play a cop better?
I've seen them and their evil when they think nobody's looking. I've seen the  compassion, I've seen the anger, I've seen the jealousy, I've seen fear,  I've seen respect and I've seen hate- from cops

There's a part of my heart that you'll never change
There's a dream so alive, it's an endless flame
And you can't keep us down, cause we'll always come back again, always come back again
For the highs and the lows, for the rise and falls
And the times that you thought you'd given your all
For a night and a dream and those moments you'll never get back again, never get back again


Cause the world is at our feet


We've been through a thousand heartbreaks
But you know we still believe
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
And don't stop us now we've started
Cause there's no one we can't beat
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
We wear our hearts upon our sleeve


Hear the crowd in the stands and out in the streets
Every fan, everywhere, on the edge of their seats
It's a beautiful day for a beautiful game, beautiful game
See the players run out and the anthems ring
And you're singing so hard you can't hear a thing
But the beat of your heart as it's beating you up again, beating you up again


Cause the world is at our feet


We've been through a thousand heartbreaks
But you know we still believe
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
And don't stop us now we've started
Cause there's no one we can't beat
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
We wear our hearts upon our sleeve


5 Seconds of Summer 'til the end of the game
The joy, the heartache, the tension, the pain
The striker shoots, there's a roar from the crowd
They think it's all over, it is now
It's our generic football anthem to be sung around the world
And we hope it doesn't sound like any others that you've heard


Don't stop us now we've started
Cause there's no one we can't beat
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
We wear our hearts upon our sleeve

"I'm taking it back
I'm making a pact
I will make you indispensable
I spoke to myself
Oh, I might as well
And let you just be made sensible

Tell me your thoughts so I can love you in spite of them
But now I'm happy if I never lose sight of them

I'll take it back
I never said it did
And that's a fact
As of a month ago
But now that the worst is over
I can just take it back

Oh, lovers they come

A phone booth somewhere in Lovertown
It isn't so bad
Those others I've had
It isn't as if I'm losing ground

I'm getting better when I annex myself from you
It oughtta be another country I'm moving to

Think about the shit that you say
You'll wish you never crossed me, you had me then you lost me
You're losing all your buck with your bank
You've got a big mouth, makes me want to tear it out
Really don't have nothing to say
I'm not your scapegoat, ram it down your damn throat
For me it's just another day!

Bitches playing FED's, so you know I'ma keep my nine on
Nigga better not play, because if he do, it's homicide, G
All I know is get it how I live on my side, G

Rule number one: Don't go against the grain
Rule number two: Give respect where respect due
Rule number three: If you get knocked, play games and say names
The 45 will tear you out the frame
It's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fucking thing
For me ain't nothin' changed, but the things my money brings
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
You peoples got plenty money actin like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin' chopped on chow lines
An old timer schooled me, said: ""Don't burn bridges, my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo' ass gotta swim""
I watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk in New York
Me and shorty stood from a far and had a talk
He said ""I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin' he had a lot of nerve""

Yo when the Feds come in the game, loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin' feminine
With the Feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke, you get ten, you'll damn near do nine
I hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary, a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya' cheese
Try to see three hundred G's before you see 300Z's
Tree top to feel the breeze, coke connect for key's
Yo' bitches sexin' me, take me to ecstacy
Once I nut, I don't want 'em next to me
If it's on, mother fucker, believe I'mma ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood before I swallow my pride

I bet I grab a 4-pound and back that ass down
See many men live, baby, and many men die
Many men get drunk, puff lye and stay high
Here's a jewel: love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same, friends always change
I learned quick that there's more than one way to skin a cat
You can get 'em in the face, dog, or down his back
All bullshit aside now, its time to be honest
I fear no man, for death is all that's promised
I got niggas standin' in line waitin' to hear me spit
From '86 to '96 the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin' to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Ain't nothin' changed in the game, but faces and names
The state, the weight, the date and the jake

Baby, I've got this thing for you
I'm thinking there's something going on now
A wicked imagination
A serious kind of something new
It's driving me right out of my mind now
It's got to be desperation
Can't feel no pain when I'm thinking about you
Dreaming isn't black and white
Can't make no gain until my vision comes true
Give it to me like I'd like to give it to you


Love I want to feel your love
Right from the bottom of my heart to your hands
 Love I want to feel your love
You know this waiting for you boy I can't stand


Being just who you want to be and doing whatever
Comes to mind now
I got to get information
Never knew what to do with you
You're giving me something to hold on to
My newest infatuation
""People Power"" means I got to believe you
Can't you hear the voices calling
Keep your flowers because their colour will turn blue
Give it to me like I'd like to give it to you


Love I want to feel your love
Right from the bottom of my heart to your hands
 Love I want to feel your love
You know this waiting for you boy I can't stand
Love I want to feel your love
Right from the bottom of my heart to your hands
 Love I want to feel your love

Will the water pull me down and wash it all away?
Come and take me over, welcome to the game
Will the current drag me down and carry me away?
Suddenly the light begins to fade

Filthy
I can't wake up
I can not hold on
I will not let go
Worthless
It's over now
Guilty
There's no way out
I cannot hold on
I will not let go


Silent I go under, I am not afraid

Safe to say it's over, sink into the grave
There is nothing left inside, but I am wide awake

Then I'm back doin me, back out on the spree
Catch me and niggas slippin out pumpin that D

"Falling from the sky now, the sign of the burning sun
Into the face of the evil one
Nowhere to hide now we're on the run right before your eyes

We're watching, we're waiting, our souls are forsaken
The sign of the warriors, the evil will rise

Through the fire and the flames, breaking the chains
Into the night we go
Torment and pain trample the slain
Soldiers of death we know


Our steel will shine forever through the night and blinding rain!
We'll see them face their fears; it's time to rise again in everlasting pain


Fly free for what we believe
One thousands hearts bleeding the eternal dream
Feel me the touch we all need
So silently now we will kneel
Cry for eternity

See now the fallen will live again
They feel the pain burn inside of them
Remember now what you feel again deep down inside
Still cursing still crawling we're endlessly falling
The downfall of mankind the fate of us all

Hold your hands to the sky bleed and you cry
Screaming until we know
Dying in pain again and again
Onwards to hell below

Stand strong we'll live forever raging through the barren lands
Our eyes have seen the sorrow far across the sands
The power in our hands







Fly far away to the end of our days
The voices of long distant cries
Now we remain in this labyrinth of pain
And so we ride into the night

Playing with Troll dolls to scare the kids away
My closet was a time machine, yours a stage

Making a campfire out of broken flashlights
Jealous of your high tops 'cause someone stole mine
Wish somebody would've told me that we'd be alright

And what about you, Mr. Poetry?
And what about all that we built in just a couple weeks?

Picking little fights over falling asleep
I wish you knew I loved you when you knew you loved me
Really wish I knew you sooner than my 20s

I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga, it's how it is
Homie got into a fight last night that killed his kids


In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead


I ain't a killer but don't push me, dawg
For the family I'll send that ass straight to God
In this life I lead, I seen the most of my 23 years
When vision is blurry, the money is clear
Some of my peers eternally will sleep in a coffin
And when Nob' on the road, I'm extremely cautious
It happen that fast, split second you gone
At the top of my tombstone put ""Nob' was raw""
Outlaw 'til I'm under the floor, for Kadafi the Prince
I stack dough like I clocked all the bricks
With a watch on my wrist, dawg, I know the time these days
We Outlawz, we gon' die this way nigga 
We already in the history books, 'Pac made sure of that
Whatever you took, we takin' it back
You know it's all for the foundation
Outlawz, we still buildin' the Thug Nation; holla at ya homie!


In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead


It ain't nothin' but in-between nuts, oxygen is gettin' hot
Got a problem, old fag-ass nigga, kick rocks
*Bin Laden* on the phone and that nigga talkin' crazy
I don't know who to blame, him or *Bush* for killin' babies
I'm a New Jerz' Devil, the street, creative rebel
Only got one shot to produce on every level
This is bags I must, go the max I must
Nigga, I came from not much, so money I clutch
Uh-uh, Napoleon the strength of the strong-arm
When they think they was in the right
I prove they movin' wrong
I'm a hardcore product of the ghetto
Been blessed fo' sho' to eat from out the ghetto
I maneuver, in the right lane, quick to push back brains
Switchin' to the left lane, I'm playin' my hands
And I'm plottin' on the fortune, it's gettin' hot and scorchin'
I'm diggin' like a scorpion that torture they enemies


In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead


Now with this Outlaw lifestyle that I been introduced to
Money and hoes keep us closer to Lucifer
Steady seducin' us and now I'm all for it
This the life for me and the law can't spoil it
So you can call it what the fuck you want
But I'm a ballin' alcholic with a sawed-off pump
My momma ain't raised no punk; and neither did 'Pac
So when it jump off, I breathe for Yak'
Been puttin' in work, so I walk with a bop
And it ain't safe at home, so I sleep with a Glock 
Thug livin', uhh, what the fuck'd be better?
I do my dirt with the family so we dyin' together


We on a mission for mo', gangsta shit on you hoes
We ain't fuckin' with you most
Just crooks and niggas about they flow
Tryin' to live Godzilla
E.D.I. went from a Bad Boy to an anybody killer
Look out, wanted man, guns in hand, stand firm
Nuts and my pride, now let's burn
Bound to the fam going down swingin'
Holding my ground, now we the last ones breathin'
Won't stop until we even deep in the trenches
So many killings it's senseless
So in this life I lead, I stay protected
By God, my squad, and this thing in my palm
Now all my hustlin' motherfuckers, get your money, sing along


In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

You know what time it is

Yo, yo, we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan, then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around with them pounds and Berettas
Yeah faggot, if I want it, I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me, or I got to grab it
Don't make a ass out of yourself trying to stop me
I'm cocky, rap's Rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, eight levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga
Ugly nigga, I'm the wrong one to provoke
You ratting on niggas is only going to leave you smoked
So the only thing left now, is toasts for these cowards
I got no friends; fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit; 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars; they lay around flowers


I got a industry gangstress, that argues, and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch, like she Queen Latifah
Now all the vehicles is long enough to stash the street sweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
I'm sliding through the Rucker, with Prada on the chuckers
So the spring break hoes home from college want to fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I sic Rottweilers on you fuckers, cops following to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lot of zeros
When it come to paper, I blow the soul out a hero
I'ma break before I lay in the floor buried, besides
Every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, we're smoking by the big screen
Changing the channel, looks like I'm playing the Game Boy
I know the watch bothering your vision
But reach, and I put a dot on your head
Like it's part of your religion
Why party with a pigeon? I'm blowing a ten
Because Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison
I'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
But it ain't a problem getting dressed
Because my closet got more aisles than Pathmark
Run when we starting a raid
Or leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs
I'm a young pimp, pardon my age
I don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids
Niggas find out what club they at, take them with us
And run trains on them, like a subway map
Your advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels
Got most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper
I go to college on the tour
I'm going down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
Keep your ammo clean, TECs polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hampers that monitor the floor
By now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery
Flashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy
White tee burgundy, you match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I tote, C-notes from different years
Bezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher
You better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive
You ain't getting nutting, but you french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga


You still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere
You going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life
And your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you
Something positive, alright:
Well, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;
You ain't going nowhere
Get yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb 
Fucking dirtbag

I think I've walked too close to love
And now iIm falling in
There's so many things this weary soul can't take
Maybe you just caught me by surprise
The first time that I looked into your eyes


There's a life inside of me that I can feel again
It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known
It don't matter where I lay my head tonight
Your arms feel like home
Feel like home


This life ain't the fairytale we both thought it would be
But I can see your smiling face as it's staring back at me
I know we both see these changes now
I know we both understand somehow


There's a life inside of me that I can feel again
It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known

Give 'em fire in the booth it don't matter who you asking
Ra ra ra ra like a dungeon dragon
Doom doom doom, hear the bass beat blastin'
All up in your face, unashamed for the masses


Woo! I heard they needed to know
My whole crew spittin' truth
Yeah you needed it though
Hold up
Can't keep it closed, that's cruel
It be cold, like the heat was low
Hold up
Yeah this is it, your time baby get up and show 'em you with us
What burn at the core, like when you doin' sit ups
Unashamed, that's the message that we give 'em
I live it  'til the day that I'm finished
Copy what he did and I'm still authentic, winning 
H-town my city, put it in the air let me know that you with it

In pain, my game, his hope 'cause

Recognize a real squad when you see mine
Don't it seem odd that we live our lives to please God
Press pause on a raw explicit 
Unashamed of the truth but unafraid to live it
Still afraid of the leaven though I see my dough rise
One of those guys actin' like nobody know God like I do
Speak my piece, keep my peace
So I ain't gotta keep my piece, capisce?
Click thick like a chain, try to take a link up out it 
We ain't unashamed just because we rap about it, nah
We unashamed ‘cause we live it
I'm throwing out the real so they probably catching feelings
Give it away, give it away now, now nah that ain't it

Are you a man of peace, or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you, don't know which anymore
So many full of life, but also filled with pain
Don't know just how many will live to breathe again

A life that's made to breathe destruction or defense
A mind that's vain, corruption, bad or good intent
A wolf in sheep's clothing, or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe a holy war winner

They fire off many shots and many parting blows
Their actions beyond the reasoning only God would know
And as He lies in Heaven, or it could be in Hell
I feel he's somewhere here, or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know


Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is


More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine, death and war
You know, religion has a lot to answer for


Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is


And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find it's ashes that are scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere, another war begins

And all because of it, you'd think that we would learn
But still the body count, the city fires burn
Somewhere, there's someone dying in a foreign land
Meanwhile, the world is crying, ""stupidity of man""
Tell me why, tell me why


Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is

Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby’s got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls


She takes just like a woman, yeah she does
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl


Queen Mary, she’s my friend
Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can’t be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she’s like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls


She takes just like a woman, yes
She makes love just like a woman, yeah, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl


Yeah, it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what’s worse
Is this pain in here
I can’t stay in here
Ain’t it clear that


I just can’t fit
Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don’t let on that you knew me when

Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it, ayy


Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast

My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar 
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car 
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

Son of a gun is back

Chaos - panic

Apocalypse now - walls of flame
Billowing smoke - who's to blame

Forged from steel - iron will
Shit for brains - born to kill

Nobody thought I'd make it, the world called me loser
Just a high school dropout, young drug abuser
Mama told me there'd be days like this, I never listened
Spent my childhood years in my neighborhood prison
The world don't give a fuck about the kids
I can see from the poverty and the evil shit they did
To my young nation
Participation, more hesitation could turn lethal
When ain't no love for a young nigga, he turn evil
And burn people with no hope, there's no peace
So all my niggas start regulatin' on your streets
Bustin' the neighborhood scatters, another drug war
There ain't no truce or negotiatin' with thug lords
Tried conversatin' but he won't listen
He said the world is a livin' hell for God's children
Picture him still in the pen', doin' life plus two
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview

It's clearer now, 'cause I'm a noted individual
Plus I'm a Don, not just a small time criminal
Times have changed, homies died, only lives remain
Massive amounts of narcotics help me hide the pain
Wishin' on Benz, came up on a Jag
Then got it out for the quiet times, reflect on the past
All my homeboys that didn't make it, for you I'll do it
'member back in the days as young truants
HUH! tellin' me to beware
Because you cared and helped me to be prepared
Cemetery full of homies no longer here
But what about the babies, lost in watchin' burglars
Too dumb to be a dealer, too young to be a murderer
I'm beggin' you God, don't make their lives too hard
They're already scarred, too doped up to see the stars
We're livin' to die, everybody is high, plus I'm high too
Starin' at the world through my rearview HUH!

Pictures are plenty, handlin' semi, sippin' Henny
I hustle for pennies, know my own feared by many
I watched and took notes as a child I strategized
Witnessin' crack dealings and drug killings have scattered lives
Niggas don't know me but they think
That we could be closer than homies
Nigga you're phoney so quit buyin' drinks
Mind on my money, you're funny, you're about my currency
Niggas don't wanna see me
Shootin', but they ain't worry me, livin' to tell
Prison is hell for a nigga, they're usin' my bail
Built bigger jails for a nigga
Father I'm feelin' tired, forgive me, 'cause I'm a sinner
Livin' life as a thug, while duckin' cops and the criminals
Homies is dead and buried, past times are gone
You ask why I drink liquor? 'Cause my mind is gone
And if I die, then let me watch what we been through
Starin' at the world through my rearview HUH!

He's a real cool guy and he's a hero of mine
Travis, Rhinehart rolled into one cute son
Less than zero a grotesque nightmare
Subtly disturbing like normal behaviour
I understand nothing and I cannot speak
I'd walk in the park but the trees are diseased
No sweetheart and I am too confused
I only love my watch and my snakeskin shoes


I feel so small in the supermarket queue
People seem to laugh at my choice of food
My personality is held together with sellotape
A loose fit just like a numb junkies hate


I pretty my face with all this cream and stuff
Ugliness inside much harder to cover up
I lack the thought to care about politics
Just do what I like ain't that democratic
Genesis, Huey Lewis, Filofax, CD5
A backdrop to discuss over expensive wine
Didn't even know when or why I should stop
I feel so stupid like a joke that belongs


I guess all psychos are made out of money
I cannot be saved as liberals keep telling me
I don't wanna be understood I just wanna kill
Out of blandness I am your everyday thrill


Patrick Bateman
We are babies crippled in Christ
Patrick Bateman
Therefore I must be god
I must, I must be god


I touched your lips but now I just paint
Surface reflection all I desired babe
I am melancholy, flower cutting through stone
I am a crime, everybody has at home
Papers hate me but they need my behaviour
The dignity amongst Hollywood trivia
Escape is so cheap of alcohol and whores
Mines the sanity of exclusive gun laws


Art critics say pornos easily obscene
Late show retards dice clay is true poetry
They've never tried living underneath the water
That's real end of the century nausea

And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!

Winterlude by the road tonight
Tonight there will be no quarreling
Everything is gonna be all right
Oh, I see by the angel beside me
That love has a reason to shine
You’re the one I adore, come over here and give me more
Then Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re fine


Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple
Winterlude by the corn in the field
Winterlude, let’s go down to the chapel
Then come back and cook up a meal
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens
By the sun, near the old crossroads sign
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold
Winterlude, don’t be rude, please be mine


Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy
Winterlude by the telephone wire
Winterlude, it’s making me lazy
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire
The moonlight reflects from the window
Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand
Come out tonight, everything will be tight
Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re grand

"Another one of those days
Feelin like a shovel
With a lot of shit in the way
Gonna clear me a path
Right to the culprit
Straight to your fucked up past
This ain't about rage
It's about disrespect
You shoulda thought about that
Before your track went flat
Homie what the deal?
Why you talkin' shit like that?
I've had enough drama
I don't need a chump
Talkin' that trash in pajamas
Heated up like a sauna
Time to pay the piper
I ain't givin' hope like Obama
I'm spittin out flames
Better hit the deck
I'ma mic check them games
You don't need a new coach
You need a new neck
Once I connect with your throat


Still shockin' like a heart attack
Cuz I'm a maniac 
Still runnin' through the shark attack
Without a single scratch 
Still limpin' where the dog is at
Up in my brainiac 
Still bitin' while your barkin' back
So you can shut your trap 

Check 1-2
I ain't even through
Givin' you grief
Put another stain on your teeth
Back up on your feet
Call in the rescue
Better get the whole damn fleet
This attack ain't stealth
It's worldwide
Homicide bad for your health what
I'm goin' straight for the gut
Closin' them minds
Sewin' them lips straight shut
Go ahead put it on me
Show me what you got
Why you get robbed like a zombie
It's a one man army
Puff Puff give
Watch 'em get smoked like a cig
You heard of Freddy Kruger?
I'm kinda like that
With a red cap and a Ruger
Still slingin' it to ya
Microphone hustla
Bad motha fucka
Screw ya



Swimmin' with
Sharks ain't easy
They just want
To kill and eat me
I ain't gonna
Let that happen
Watch me plan
My shark attack, then
Make them wish
They never knew me
Turn their great
White ass to sushi

Old school technique
It's all I need

Yeah, I won't let go, ohh

Lately I've been thinking about the past
How there is no holding back
No point in wasting sorrow
On things that won't be here tomorrow

But you and I well we don't need to speak
It's the secret that we keep
Out of view and out of sight
Just say when and we'll say goodnight


Tell me it's okay
To live life this way
Sometimes I want you to stay
I know it's a shame
Shame
Shame


Now I have spent so much of my time
Going out of my mind
Trying so hard to be of use
But what you cannot gain you lose

In LA, the sun's almost too bright
I cannot get it right
The emptiness I feel
And now none of it seems real


So maybe it's alright
If I just spend the night
Sometimes I just can't bear to walk away
I know it's a shame
Shame
Shame

Who have I become
Who will I be
Come tomorrow

Tell me it's okay
If I ask you to stay
Sometimes the night cuts through me like a knife
I know it's a shame
I know it's a shame
I know it's a shame

Emma eats bread and butter
Like a queen would have ostrich and cobra wine
We’ll have Satanic Christmas Eve
And play piano in the Chateau lobby


I’ve never done this
Baby, be gentle
It’s my first time
I’ve got you inside
People are boring
But you’re something else completely
Damn, let’s take our chances


I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian


And I’ve never thought that
Ever thought that once in my whole life
You are my first time
People are boring
But you’re something else I can’t explain
Here take my last name


First time, you let me stay the night despite your own rules
You took off early to go cheat your way through film school
You left a note in your perfect script:
""Stay as long as you want,"" and I haven’t left your bed since


I haven’t hated
All the same things as somebody else
Since I remember
What’s going on for, uh, what are you doing with your whole life?

Why we do only heaven knows
And I don't know why I'm still holding on, holding on

My heart makes no apologies


When an apology's made it isn't always enough
To erase all the past in a moment

You always leave me behind

You've been blind not to realize

Woke up this morning, feeling blue
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you

I don't care what in the world you do


I went back home, put on my tie
Going to get that girl that money that money will buy
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you

Said, ""Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?""
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Got blood in my eyes for you, babe

I couldn't help but notice your pain

It runs deep
Share it with me!


They'll never take me alive
I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin' up dust
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless
Rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb, cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me
What should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family
What else could I do?
But be a thug
Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs
Got my mind on danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive-bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young
But still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse
Mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court
So fuck what you thought
I'm drinkin' hennessey
Runnin from my enemies
Will I live to be 23?
There's so much pain


Everywhere I go
I see the darkness
Covering skys
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
Trouble seems to find me
Blood in my eyes
Everywhere I go


What would you do, if you couldn't make it to the NBA?
What would you do, if you couldn't sing, like a Mary J?
What would you do, if you couldn't hit a white ball, like Tyga?
If you wanted to model, but you wasn't skinny like Tyra?
What if you wanted to be Eminem
But the closet thing to him, was a pack of M&M's?
You can be Eminem, and I got proof
Or you could be Obama, and bring back troops
Or you could be Osama, and tear off roofs
Or be Corporate America, and reject all youth
Be the fly on the woodgrain, inside my Coop
Or be the sole, inside my shoe
So you can see where I walk, you can see where I been
See my father raping my sister when she was just ten
9, 8, 7, 6, NASA take me away, life's a bitch


Everywhere I go
Trouble seems to find me
Blood in my eyes
Everywhere I go


They got me mobbin' like I'm
Loc'ed and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - blaaastin'
I'm a nuttin, drinkin' Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die
Tell me why cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards
Want to kill me in my sleep but will they can I see
And everyday it's just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin' loc
Don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell
A nigga from the gutta
Word to mutha I'm tough
I'm kickin dust up
Ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
Until they kill me
I'll be livin this life
I know you feel me
There's so much pain

Me and my twin would've been just like Phil and Lil


Now with one wish, Blink grant you one trip
Where we going this adventure
Who you wanna come with
See and you're my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, but it gotta be done quick

And Tommy is sad
And Phil and Lil misses their mommy and dad
So pick a time and date
And find a place
And I guarantee you that we all get home safe

"The cattle prowled and the coyotes howled
Out on the Great Divide
I never done no wrong, just singing a song
As down the trail I ride
The rattlesnakes rattle at the prairie dogs
Don't you hear that mournful tune
For it's roundup time away out West
When the cactus are in bloom

Daylight comes and the cowhands yell
They call out ev'ry man
I throw my saddle on my old cowhorse
I drink my coffee from a can
The sun goes down on the cattle trail
I'm gazing at the moon
For it's roundup time away out West
When the cactus are in bloom

We don't have cold weather
It never snows or rains
That is where the sunshine's best
Out on the western plains
Some of the boys have gone away
But they will be back soon
For it's roundup time away out West
When the cactus are in bloom

Daylight comes and the cowhands yell
They call out ev'ry man
I throw my saddle on my old cowhorse
I drink my coffee from a can
The sun goes down on the cattle trail

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars


She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours


Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of


Blue velvet

Precious and warm a memory
Through the years


And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

"When your world is full of strange arrangements
And gravity won't pull you through
You know you're missing out on something
Well, that something depends on you

All I'm saying, it takes a lot to love you
All I'm doing, you know it's true
All I mean now, there's one thing
Yes one thing that turns this grey sky to blue

That's the look, that's the look
The look of love

When your girl has left you out on the pavement 
Then your dreams fall apart at the seams
Your reason for living's your reason for leaving
Don't ask me what it means

Who's got the look? I don't know the answer to that question
Where's the look? If I knew I would tell you
What's the look? Look for your information
Yes, there's one thing, the one thing that still holds true 

That's the look, that's the look
The look of love

If you judge a book by the cover
Then you'd judge the look by the lover
I hope you'll soon recover
Me I go from one extreme to another

And though my friends just might ask me
They say ""Martin, maybe one day you'll find true love""
I say ""Maybe, there must be a solution
To the one thing, the one thing, we can't find""

"After nine years in the army
They took away his brain
They tattooed ""defect"" on his brow
And signed him up again

He killed ten thousand Germans
A hundred Japanese
A family of Hindus
And a lot of Portugese
Nine plan failed

I could never see the point
Of showing them you're boss
When they drag you through the city streets
And naiI you to a cross

They took him to the office
They strapped him to the bed
They fastened lots of pretty wires
Securely to his head
They wheeled him down the corridor
Upon a metal trolley
Now he wears big spectacles
And he sings like Buddy Holly
Nine plan failed

I could never see the point
Of showing them you're boss
When they drag you through the city streets
And nail you to a cross

The world declared its armistice
And took away his guns
And now he satisfies himself
On piss-weak tea and buns
On piss-weak tea and buns
Oh oh at the disco

Rome is very pretty
And Rome is very grand
But the Pope lost his four fingers
When they gave this boy his hand to kiss
When they gave this boy his hand to kiss
It wasn't funny no

He wasn't very good at school
His highest grade was C
But he believed the managers
When they said: ""you leave it all to me""
They gave him suits from Saville Row
The quality so fine
So now he sits in the desert wastes
Just waiting for the sign
Nine plan failed

Does anybody have an answer why

It was more than a tragedy, emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky, we tryna figure what happened
Burnin’ churches, fearin' God, who can be so cruel?
We all ignorant to AIDS 'til it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans, listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave them a choice
'Cause who are we to say who lives and die, breathes and stops?
All this judgement on other lives needs to stop
What are we livin' for, givin' more back than takin’
On my knees still waitin’ for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned 'cause Pat Buchanan say I’m greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war but can't feed me
It's so easy to regret thangs after they done
Babies catchin' murder cases, scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need, love in doses
In times like these we feel closest, the good die young

Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did, so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin' like a star
And this murder got me feelin' like my death ain't far

Don't get no weaker or no harder

Therefore the wise move in silence
Analyze scandalous times

And all probably damned for living our lives so unruly
Ain't a preacher that could fool me
There ain't a teacher that could school me
Since a young soldier, never been sober while getting older
Playing this dirty game of life, making it hard to keep my hopes up
I'm hopeless, just another lost soul that lost focus
Homie, the good die young, pay attention and you'll notice


Days go past and as they pass, time move, quicker
No time for wastin', put your hustle down my young dealers
'Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers ain't ridin' 4-3 felony's

Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does

Well, I saw it advertised one day
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way
""Come along and take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and family
Bring the whole kids""
Yippee


Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
To this thing called the Bear Mountain picnic
Little did I realize
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise
Had nothing to do with picnic
Didn't come close to a mountain
And I hate bears


Took the wife and kids down to the pier
There was six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
""Oh well,"" I said ""it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier""


Well, we all got on, and what do you think?
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept a-piling on
That old ship was a-going down
Funny way to start a picnic


Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife
So many people, I never saw in my life
That old ship was sinking down in the water
There was six thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming
Women a-yelling, men a-flying, fists a-flying
Paper flying, cops a-coming, me a-running
Maybe we just better call off the picnic


I got shoved down, got pushed around
All I remember was a moanin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
All I remember is waking up on the shore
My arms and legs were broken
My feet were splintered
My head was cracked
I couldn't walk
I couldn't talk, smell, feel
Couldn't see
Didn't know where I was
I was bald
Quite lucky to be alive though


Well, feeling like I just climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife and kids and started home
Wishing I'd never got up that mornin'


Now, I don't care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic, that's up to you
But don't tell me about it, I don't want to hear it
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic
Have a picnic in the bathroom


Well, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
There's a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebody's money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat, send them up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic

We are the only, we are the brave
We are America, but we are to blame


Stand up, stand up, can you hear me now?

"There's a chill on this evening, the night's right for grieving
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights
They remind him of nights long ago
When his love was strong and his muscles taut, His whiskey throat was barely marred
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a broken heart bought him to his knees
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not hold


On the borderline of love again, It's bound to make you pay
On the borderline, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away

And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his woman's love
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger and fear

As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen leaves
He can't believe how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his injured pride
His purple heart hidden deep inside, The only reward for a love he could not show

Reminds me everything is right, yeah
And I been waiting my whole life
Searching for the other side

I'll be your man if the rain keeps on falling
Forever is calling

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder


And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind


Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today


Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor


Crying
God knows I'm good

The object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I’m on a mission, got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady, yellin' out spots for me to hit, and ""aw shit""
Soon as I seen her, saw us playin' hide the weiner
Want a ""Freak Like Me"", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holler out my name when a thug nigga ride, ""Can I cum inside?""
Say you don't feel it, that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye when I walked by, I said ""Hi""
But you were so shy, I can't lie, damn-near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it, and even worse
Got your heart set on me going first, and that ain't no fair exchange!

Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw your legs out the window
Remember on the balcony? Bend over baby, bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my ""Temptations""

In bed naked you're so twisted think your legs breakin'
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait until you asleep and that's the payback
'Cause you're actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece

Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers

But as the proud man exalts, he's gonna find his faults
But as the wise man sees, he knows, he knows

Where he can be happy all the time
Where love is, where happiness is

So I puff my trees at the local bench
I don't stick around
I'm so foul
Red cards got me wow
Wolvo my home town
My brain won't allow
All these fucking doubts
They tell me slow down and let my hair down, yeye
I hardly go out now I'm sipping shit I can't pronounce like
Scarlxrd came in, walked on, fat cheques
This is the shit that I spit when I’m gone of the ritalin, I’m no affiliate I like to kill this shit steady I’m feeling it how do I see these things both eyes closed, might go vision it I'll get bigger than this whole devision I’m the builder, building every building

I can’t lose I got the plan
I don’t think they understand man
I feel like I’m Alice in Wonderland
I’m getting lit with the mad hatter
I find the loot like I’ve got a tracker
I put my self on a mad standard
Spitting out food of my own platter
I live my life like it doesn’t matter

"All the trees stood like skeletons
Silhouettes of spilled ink
And the snows fell in sheets and got wrapped around our feet
We built the fire evermore with winter beating at the door

Brother's eyes were getting heavier
His bony hands cold and white
And I could hear his ragged breathing like the wind along a knife
There beside him through the night, in the hum of candlelight
I no longer felt the time

Brother woke just after midnight
And he didn't make a sound
And as he climbed from out of bed with severed rings around his head
His feet didn't touch the ground

I could feel it then
A tiny miracle
So I followed him
Into the woods
Crossed beneath the trees
But only I left my prints in tow
He was afloat
Found a lonely tree
And tied himself within its limbs
And he said to me these words:
Don't you fear for me
I am where I'm supposed to be

And when I woke he was gone
And I was wrapped in blankets on the lawn
The sky was blue and my skin matched the hue
And I could hear mother crying in your room
From here on out I wear this face for both of us

Too well to be held with only me in mind

How am I different?


I can't do it
So move along
Do you really want to wait until I prove you wrong?
And don't tell me
Let me guess
I could change it all around if I would just say yes


But how am I different?
How am I different?
How am I different?


And just one question before I pack
When you fuck it up later
Do I get my money back?


I can't do it
And as for you
Can you in good conscience even ask me to
Cause what do you care
About the great divide
As long as you come down
On the winner's side


And how am I different?
How am I different?
How am I different?


Just one question before I buy
When you fuck it up later
Do I get my money back?

"It's another Tequila Sunrise
Staring slowly cross the sky
I said goodbye

And he was just a hired hand
Working on the dreams he planned to try
As days go by

And ever night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' round

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from coming home
It's been so long

Oh, and it's a hollow feeling
When it comes down to seeing friends
It never ends

Take another shot at courage
And wonder why the right words never come
You just get none

This whole world still looks the same
Another friend...

You never make a move, 'til you've got something to prove

Young ingenue, escapes unscathed
You read the part, but you didn't get it
Left ""Lancelot"" out of the picture credit

If there's just one line, that springs to mind today
Your bottom-lit face, hovering in outerspace

Upon a cross, strapped to a lathe
Young ingenue, escapes unscathed
You read your part from your beer-gut heart
Then you fell to earth, where you became a star

Each time, I see, your face, remains
Your beer-gutheart escapes unscathed
Left Lancelot out of a part
You married the monster, but not the art

You fell to earth, but you wanted it back, now
You slipped at the tracks now, the one with the cross?
And it's all gone bad hasn't it?
Now that you're dead

I light a fire in your soul, baby
The lightest touch of feathers falling

And before you sleep at night

Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?

Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us 
But not us

I am the last light fading
Leave all the lost souls behind
Show me the silence breaking

And we'll fall behind


So I'll wait for you
As I keep your faith alive

As we cross the great divide


Bury the wounds deep inside
Rupture the fault line breaking
Dream of the world left behind
Show us we're worth forsaking
And when the cold begins to rise
Darkness is overtaking
And when the fear is satisfied

And I won't miss you then
The weight of every word on my chest
So I curse my name and my fragile frame
Anywhere could feel like home 
But I'm going to Mexico


Oh, Mexico
Sounds so sweet, but I'm going there alone
I tried to be myself, but still, I've got some room to grow
I'm going to Mexico

I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days there was enough
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
I was in but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free


Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club


I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's somethin' about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too ill
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sittin' pretty on the throne, there's nothing more I want
Except to be alone


Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club







Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hidin' places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member, go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end


Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

One morning when I was riding in my old pickup truck
A beautiful bluebird came flying down
My eyes caught the color, as it lead me down the road
Dipping and bobbing in the sun


Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies
Looks like she's always going home
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying back to you
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies
Looks like she's always going home


I've never seen that blue before, except in one place
And she's not here with me right now
And just like a lover, I watched her fly away
And that's what I remember now




If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying back to you
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying home to you

Wall to wall, it's packed
Give your hands a smack
Polish up my watch
VIP is in the back
Hear the beat of the music playing
Rat pack, hi-hat swaying
I'll blaze it up and braise it

Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living

Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't


Oh no, the goose is loose
Just feeling up this groove
Don't it feel nice
Burning up these lights
Those green eyes, I've been watching
Got me all caught up and
The way your hips are talking
I can't stop it

Bring the heat back
I could party with you, you could party with me
If you party with us, then you better believe
That the lights are up in this town
But they're about, about to go down
And it's about midnight
Oh, and I think she might
Told her to spin around, all around this town


Feels like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat

Before the apple hit the ground not far from the tree

Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm


Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?
Just another dummy caught up in the system
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard
Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak, yo
Should I be mentally weak, verse being Malik? Yo
Should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that?
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?
The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement


Melanated shrouded in complexity
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity
Mouth translate happens organically
The media relates it what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk
Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain
I'm chillin', felon down to the DNA crime willin'
Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons
Pumping false religions to all of these niggas' systems
Every voice devoid of the truth
Come on, listen


Man look at this, man look at this
Whatever will be will be
Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams
Certainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killers' capture
Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way
The rarity is in the rear, but never today
Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play
On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz
And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs
You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind
Yes, the government will fund, learning is free for everyone
And from that lie, young leaders will rise
In the eyes of despair and adversity
In some universe, this verse will be true


Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Some will dash to the mountain, some will crawl
And the weakest amongst them, they will fall
But the strongest in faith, they will stand tall
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be


I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia
'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia
'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria

And maybe your mama drove you around in a Chevy Nova bright blue
Might've got your 16 first date, yes at a slider in the drive thru
Down on Main Street, she was so cute, ended up just friends
If it sounds like it could've been you, or it's somewhere you might've been
Can I get an amen?


For a Roman candle sky
A July praying for rain
Yeah, sparks out the window, cigarette
With her silhouette caught in the flames
The keys to a fix-it-up dream
The love in a first crush heart
And to not knowing the secrets of life
But damn sure knowing where it starts
Amen, amen, amen


And maybe you shot some bullet holes through the tail of a windmill
Stuck a cross in some flowers by the road on the edge of a wheat field
And maybe that scar on your hands from a midnight parking lot disagreement with one of your buddies
So you squared off, then you made up
With a tailgate cold beer apology
Just some memories that'll always be

There's a storm across the valley
Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon is heavy
On your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane
A mile or more away
And the whining of his wheels
Just makes it colder

On your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road
Are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning
Supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes
That makes him warm


Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again


There's all the news to tell him
How'd you spend your time
What's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday
Sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday


Hey, it's good to be back home again, yes it is
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again


And all the time that I can lay this tired, old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for
The love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me


It's the sweetest thing I know of
Just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm


Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

Was always making two
I never thought that I was breaking you

Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin' wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin' cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin' me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon

Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night

I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
""Stay strong, keep your faith in God,"" what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't recieved any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine


Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it


Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life

Drawn into the frost on the glass was a map
Pointing to my secret hiding place
It lead you to the tree with the split in its trunk
On the way into your family's yard
In that tree, you saw I brought the dog back to life


I watch you from the branches while you stared
From the ground, with a look I couldn't understand
So I said ""leave me alone
If your only words are ugly ones""
And you just smiled
And said ""come and show me how it's done""


You dug up your old bird
And you held her to your chest
As I breathed life back into her lungs
And she blinked and flapped her wings
She sang a familiar song
Before she took to the air
And cut a path into the woods

And then I cried
Cause all my life
I have known something was off
But you just shrugged and said: ""it ain't just you""


Slipping on the pavement where we ran
From the ghosts that you saw
Behind the cellar door
That's the way that you showed me
That I wasn't quite alone
That you'd also touched the dead before

When you don't know where you've been?
You hide the shame that you're not showing
And you won't let anyone in
A crowded street can be a quiet place
When you're walking alone
And now you think that you're the only
One who doesn't


Have to try
And you won't have to fail
If you're afraid to fly
Then I guess you never will


You hide behind your walls
Of maybe nevers
Forgetting that there's something more
Than just knowing better
Your mistakes do not define you now
They tell you who you're not
You've got to live this life you're given
Like it's the only one you've got


Memories have left you broken
And the scars have never healed
The emptiness in you is growing
But so little left to fill
You're scared to look back on the days before
You're too tired to move on
And now you think that you're the only one who doesn't

And then close up the blinds, and wish that I was dead

Some people wanna call me a bitch
Some people wanna tell me that it ain't that bad

This world asks for so much
Despite what you give it's just never enough
Then you're left cold tired and alone
Searching for something that's already gone
You try not to be afraid
Bound down by all of these things that they say
And you feel like you're all by yourself
But I’ll be right here when there's nothing else


Lay down
Rest here in peace in my arms now
Knowing you're safe
From the storms and the rain
And from all of your pain
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains
Only the silence remains


Your fears they know that you're scared
Wherever you go they seem to meet you there
And you face them all on your own
Never the weak always the strong
And you win most of the time
Never once claiming that victory's mine
And you carry this burden alone
But this candle's burned at both ends for so long


Lay down
Rest here in peace in my arms now
Knowing you're safe

With your friends and go crazy, just bring the shotty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair.""
Making out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kicked me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga, see this long hair, see these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
How the fuck did I land a fucking TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West and I ain't met him yet


La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down


Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me, guess it's Holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade 
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car 
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong, bet I get along
Make some commas, karma, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, butter knife like dancing on a knuckle
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter, I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the Volvo
Damn, shoot 'em down like, hmmm, sorry, do it all here

I'm moonwalking on the sun hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandana, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
L.A. turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm livin' different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me


I just want a friend to fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playin' my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where to bust it
Cry nigga, gotta fuckin' kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse, she couldn't miss that
Putting my ideas where my chips at


La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down

Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take

Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile


Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner


I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on


Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile


Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

See your eyes blinking
Pupils begin to grow
Drilling you softly
Pulling you in
Making your mind up
What's sick or a sin

You're corrupted by some sick fuck
Oh, no!
Open up now, head in the sky
Here's the tongue that keeps telling lies
Feelings in my mouth
You breathe in but can't breathe out

It makes you talk real slow
How come I'm thinking

Choking you gently
Gaining control
Hand you the shovel
To dig your own hole

Feel me...


This ain't just rap, it's about connects
Y'all crabs could trap talk, this is about respect
I'm a mixture of Mutulu and Malcolm X
Young Rick the Ruler, my mouth's a mess
My lil' homie home he on house arrest
Try to tell homie be grown, this is about success
The streets been sewn, we seen a thousand deaths
So many nuts bust I barely get aroused from sex
Try to do Lears at the clear, lounge on decks
Amongst those who couldn't care what's around my neck
Tinted specs BBM'n or sendin' a text, linen fresh
Either we sinnin' or blendin' in with Execs
Nigga I'm blessed, puff blunts with B.I.G. in the flesh
Due to Nas in '95 with the bridge address
Live what I rep, I'm real no identity theft, my will
It's like a prisoner appealin' the stretch, it's ill
Recreation, my reputation
Could bring together the gangs from separation
So, no dough, no explanations, blow!
Get lows, my expectations glow, OG, G-O-D
And I don't know near nigga that could Deebo me

""They want something new
So let's get reacquainted""

""Switch hustles been killing 'em ever since
Hey you tell the truth dawg, it only makes sense""


Reminisce, venomous, this is limitless
Started from The Genesis
Schooled on what business is
Touch down scrimmages, targetin' your Nemesis
Barkin' at your innocence, findin' that you're friends ain't shit
Let me finish it, few niggas benefit
New niggas tend to send a cent to the penetent
Cam style, I know now what killer meant
No resemblance, movin' off my inner strength
Superb penmanship, heard that my pen was sick
Never impotent, wonder where my niggas went
Die hard is still the point even when I'm bent
Fly cars, Louie scarfs, everything is meant
Two-ten new in charge I'ma bring suspense
White Ice Blue shupar y'all ain't seen me since
The young God, took a charge for 'em two attempts
In my defense, I'm due to vent

Glass condo, relaxed in the dawn mode
Both arms fold, feet up on the console
Fuckin' bomb holds skeetin' on your cornrows
My boy Alonzo beat another homo
Let the Dom flow, try and get LeBron's dough
Head honcho high with a Milan glow
How them horns blow make a nigga mambo
White Bronco, address beef pronto
Breast meat combo, don't be a John Doe
Still calm though, OG at the trial when they hit Busy Bee in '03
Low key, live wire, flow be

Goodnight...
Goodnight folks, fell asleep reading the Bible
When I'm dreaming, I can hear my mother singin' them high notes
I see a bunch of people in life boats
They wanna keep me under, but I'm tryna stay afloat
I'm back to the day I wrote my first battle rhyme
Broke the soul of that weepin' brother, they formin' a line so I said, ""Hey
Keep em' comin."" Even though, all I play is Stevie Wonder
I don't really know no hip- hop, I grew up on CeCe Winans
Yo, I ain't' fit in for a while
They'd be partying, I would sit Indian style
Watchin' all my friends, that was back then and it's wild
In the audience, they be like ""Chris!"" and I smile
You be thinking I changed, but you don't know the half
And even if you did, man that's only half
But, God gave me something I can only have

Let's go
Deep in your heart I'll always be


I didn't know the kid would grow to love his difference
Was living for appearance or what people say
A miracle to really go through the transition
From indigo to loving on the deepest shade of me
When I dropped School of Roses that was one side of me
I was just tryna show you, what you didn't wanna see
Now I'm waking up every morning, to play the hand I been dealt
'Cause I felt like you knew me, when I didn't know myself


It's not over yet, we've only just begun
Not much time is left, gotta to get to 51
Let's go, I know we'll have some fun

A seed was planted that produced salvation
We're filled with the Spirit
So we the bear the fruits of Galatians man
And when you see us we ain't unwrapping them swishers
We've been given the sack of forgiveness
We cracking them Scriputures man
So you gon notice we on post with our life
We stand on the word with boldness cause we soldiers for Christ
We something like them dudes from 116
We ain't ashamed, forget one mic, give me one more Script
So I can begin to take the truth to the block
Uproot the dudes that been duped
Cause you can't lose with the Rock
We're glued to the Rock
Believe me, the truth will hold you
We're wet with the Living Water like a super soaker
Who can hold us back
It's a group of soldiers
Blowing on the Holy Ghost
So you can lose the doja

Cause we flossing the Rock


Taking the gospel across the globe
The book of Acts is clear
Man God is all around like the atmosphere
The tactic here is for you to get a piece of this matchless
Love that covers you up like a sheet on a mattress
It's above the average, His blood is captured
Wrath intended for us, so what can match it
So why would I even grab bub and crack it
Knowing the sons will be crushed when He judges our actions
And what happens when your platinum plaque is gone
And all the money is blown like a saxophone
You know what we on, we gon spit the bars for Him
Regardless of ends, and pray your heart is hardened to sin
So, miss me with the tipsy bit
When wickedness falls down like some pixy stix
I'm spitting this, so get the drift
We're different
Cause we've been to Romans 6:6


It's simply on the basis we wanna please Him
That's the reason we don't do the things to grieve Him man
He died for us, that's an abundance of grace
Without Him you'll go nowhere fast like you're running in place
Plus if you can't tell I've been bent on the light
Hoping the events of my life will give you a glimpse of the Christ

"Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love

"One night while out for a ramble
The hour was just about nine
I met a young maiden in Frisco
On the corner of Geary and Pine

On her face there was beauty of nature
And her eyes just seemed to expand
Her hair was so rich and so brilliant
Entwined in a blue velvet band

We strolled down the street together
In my pocket she placed her small hand
She planted the evidence on me
The girl in the blue velvet band

I heard the scream of the siren
And the girl in the blue velvet band
She left me to face all the trouble
With a diamond that was worth ten grand

They sent me to San Quentin for stealing
God knows I'm an innocent man
The guilty one now she lie's dying
The girl in the blue velvet band

Last night when bed-time was ringin
Standing there close to the bars
I fancied I heard a voice calling
Far out in the ocean of stars

I'll be out in a year and I'm leaving
But I'll carry the name of a man
That served ten years in prison
For the girl in the blue velvet band

And when I get out I'll endeavor
To live in some other land
And I'll bid farewell to old Frisco
And the girl in the blue velvet band

When my man leave the house, I know he's coming right back
I got that good good, I got that good good
No matter how much he might try to act, he know just where it's at
I got that good good, I got that good good
I put it on him right, I do it every night
I leave him sitting mouth open like whew
So I don't worry 'bout nobody taking mine
'Cause I know just the right thing to do 


I ain't never had a problem with the one 
Never been worried bout him ever cheating on me
Cause when I say I got that pop lock and drop it believe me
If I'm with you, it's gon' kill you on the days you don't see me
See the things I possess, a lot of women don't 
And the things Ima do for mine, most won't 
I hear 'em talking bout it when I'm up in the salon
Crying cause they man ain't come home, I try to tell 'em


When my man leave the house, I know he's coming right back

'Cause I know just the right thing to do 


Ladies, don't believe half what you hear, 'cause it's all a waste of time
If you know you got that good, good good, everything will be just fine
So let your man be the man when he's in public 
Even though behind the scenes y'all be runnin 
Let him run with his boys, let him play his little games
Let him drive his Cadillac, don't worry he'll be back


When my man leave the house, I know he's coming right back
I got that good good, I got that good good
No matter how much he might try to act, he know just where it's at

If you got that good good and you know it, ladies show him where's it at 
Where it's at 
See, I don't know what them other girls be doing, they be crying 'bout they man
Cause they always losing
They need that 
Gotta have that  to keep him 
You need that

I can tell these nigga's scared the way they talk
Gold pyrex, I put diamonds on my fork
Pull up on your block, white chalk
Chopper bullets skate, Tony Hawk
I'ma cut your fingers off if you shout
Pop a perc, hit the cup, nigga pause
Hundred round drum, round of applause
Bitches know I got that bag, Santa Claus
I drink lean and I pop Xans
Slaughter Gang, we the Glock clan
Poppin' molly nigga, San-Tan
I'm back on that bullshit again
I wanna fuck your best friend
I just went a bought a brand new Benz
Bitch I came from the bottom
We was starving, we was robbing


Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch
We ain't with that friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash
Another toe-tagged nigga laying in the grass


Five shooters in the back of the Uber nigga and they ready to shoot
I tie my laces, I dip in that bag nigga and I take me a blue
I'm the Slaughter King nigga, I don't give a fuck about you
You get you some money, you get you some fame, these bitches gon' come out the blue
Bullet holes in my body, paranoid I'ma pop it
If you snitchin' I'ma pop it, wrong move, I'ma drop it
.15 in my sock, trappin' at the bus stop
Came from a nickel rock, now I got a whole block

Made it ma! Top of the world!
I'm going crazy
I'm going out of my head


It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head


I'm exhausted, last night I lost it
Let the homies get loose, I'm sure I'ma get the lawsuit
Nana called, my granddaddy coughing up blood
Got an infection, the cycle of life just sucks
I bet when he die, she die, just because
They been together 60 years, that's what they call love
Paid for my first cousin wedding, over 200 grand
Then two kids and six years later, he's the wrong man
I woke up this morning, really wasn't feeling myself
Thought about suicide but me, I ain't killing myself
My cousin Dory shot his girlfriend then shot himself in the head
Before I shoot myself, I'm shooting everyone else kid
My head aching, my hands shaking, I'm sweating bullets
And it ain't even hot in this bitch, I'm going through it
My mind playing tricks on me, I mean, shit homie
I might need a straitjacket fit for me


It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head


My favorite uncle Roc got twisted 'til that liquor gave him sugar
Had complications once or twice, that shit fucked up his liver
To me he’s still the man cause see me I still remember
That lil’ snorkel he bought me to stay warm that December
I was sleeping in the basement, the window had a draft
Even with the electric heater, I was freezing my ass
I got some money now so if I die before him, I'ma leave it to him
He can have a fine nurse put that insulin needle to him
Called my son twice, he ain't picking up the phone
And Banks, me and him don't even talk no more
You know cause of me, he ain't never have to sell crack
Never used no knife or had to squeeze no strap
But if I go tonight, I bet you I'm hellbound
For cocaine distribution and letting off MAC rounds
Home invasion robberies, we ran in that crack house
Took them niggas paper and all of they packs out


It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head


Then I was in the second row the second time Em married Kim
Looking at Proof like, ""How much you think this gon' cost them?""
Feels like a set up, Shaniqua's being nice to me
I rather a nigga just put a knife in me
Than go through the emotions, the confusion and commotions
Never die down in my head, they keep going
It feels like I'm God's punching bag on occasions
Amazing, on other days, I feel like I'm His favorite
I never bite my tongue, I just call a spade a spade
When life feeding me lemons, I just make lemonade
My nana beat cancer, it came back for a rematch
Life without my old girl, I couldn't see that
My grandpa was the strongest, then he broke down and I broke down
I looked around like if shit go bad now, who I'ma gon' go to now?
That was his partner, see he knew everything about her
Now he's saying he don't wanna live without her


It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window

Look, illest of the illest, I'm a sick soul
A little margarita blend so I sip slow
Too talented type of nigga, I'm kinda schizo
But never out of my element, I let that fifth go
Shots in the club, panic at the disco
She of that MDMA, that's from Frisco
Hella chips, call me Mister Nabisco
Is that your bitch? 'Cause she won't let my go wrist go
My technique is to sex freaks
Skinny dip with hot models, bitches and lesbies
I'ma put my tongue on they soul like a ESPY
But they don't know they scum to my soul, they just sexy
I'ma play dumb, play that role in the SV, it's ridiculous
And can I get a girl with real ass and tits?
Most respect in the world to my real niggas
'Cause all them fake niggas make me wanna kill niggas
I stand alone, fuck that gang bang shit
They Nintendo blowin' niggas 'cause this game ain't shit
Uh, it's relevant that I'm better than these veterans
They sleepin' on me like I been givin' 'em sedatives
Sometimes I wish I had better friends and better peers
'Cause I know when that cheddar ends, they disappear


Damn, where they go?
Where they go? Where they go, huh?


See I'm doper than that shit Pookie was on in New Jack City
This is why I'm gettin' rich without tryin', I ain't like 50
'Cause what good is bein' rich if you dyin'? That shit is silly
Call the chain TLC, all the ice'll make you Chilli
I'm a pimp so you know I'm snatchin' your broad
I'm a real star, you Patrick from SpongeBob
L.A. my city to the streets, I'm Freeway Ricky
'Cause I keep the streets flooded with that crack music
I be sellin' CDs like them niggas push kilos
But I don't push weights unless it's plates in the weight room
Why you think I'm BUF? Blowin' Up Fast
Call me lead foot 'cause I be heavy on the gas
You would think I was a Spartan, 300 on the dash
Either that or a martian in a space aircraft
'Cause when you see that whip that I have
You be like, ""What the fuck was that?""

All I'm looking for
Is a little bit more rope
To wrap around my throat
I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble

And all I'm gasping for
Is one last breath of hope
To heal the hearts I broke
I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble


When you lay my body down
When you throw me in the ground
Don't be sorry
When you lay my body down
When you throw me in the ground


Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Turn your heart
To the trail
Of souls behind me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me


All the fearful eyes
Stay burned upon my mind
The gift they left behind
Are my troubles
Are my troubles

Still their final words
Ring louder than my thoughts
Lay heavy as a curse
I'm in trouble
I'm in trouble


When you lay my body down
When you throw me in the ground
Don't be sorry
When you lay my body down
When I'm buried in the ground


Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Turn your heart
To the trail
Of souls behind me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me


These are my confessions
I'm singing down my dying words
These are my confessions
Make peace before I hit the dirt
These are my confessions
Hear all my sins laid down in verse
These are my confessions
Oh, these are my confessions


Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
Turn your heart
To the trail
Of souls behind me
Save your prayers
Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me

A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always go to show

They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
Don't it always go to show

Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people, who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here


So these are the places you go when you choose not to answer my text?
Pull up to Up & Down, whip out the phone for the Instagram flex
Click, click
She got a job for herself but I know how she spendin' them checks
And don't worry, mama, there's no need to stress
I'ma get my respect
I get that respect, it's no flex
But you trust me, I give 'em what's next
I ain't the prince when I'm in
But you know they be thinkin' I'm fresh
Oh, I sit in the cut in the club
But come home and be thinkin' I'm Will
But don't tell the MSFTS


Tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here


Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually, I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl, who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy, who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here?


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here


Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense
And he said ""Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet""
Signed me, got a profit
Few years later yeah we on and poppin'
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in

We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look


Reporting for the operation
I learned that the beauty is in the creation
I added my detail for decoration
So baby boy, what's the occasion?
You dressed like you 'bout to take over a nation
Avoiding social litigation
When that admiration turns into abrasion
Y'all can find another station
Otherwise, stay tuned, evolution coming soon
Rolling deeper than a dune
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June
Told my baby I'd be back in November
Did some Beatles shit to kick off this September
Crazy 'cause in 2010, I had some old friends
That thought I'd be another—
Go fucking figure


If I pull up out the tool, riding still up on the roof
Seems like only legends do

Bitch, and that's the fucking move



She said, ""Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?""
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct

Good riddance, goodbye, out of sight, out of mind
Cutthroat every time, this time I get what's mine
Where the hell is your back bone?
Ducking me like whac-a-mole
Looking like an inflatable at a car show; a spectacle
Lick my finger, bet I found the wind
I follow that shit wherever it blows
You hung yourself, that's not my fault
I just supplied the rope, ugh!
Most thoughts, I don't think twice, make decisions I'll die by
Never asked for the drama, but I'll turn it into dollars
Dollars, dollars, dollars


""Do you think about me?""
Ohh, ohh

Fair game, go on and drop your head
Fairness gone and make you lose mine
Losing love all over again
But it's my way 'till the end of time
Less dread when I drop my head
Fear go and let me lose mine
I'm losing love all over again
But it's my way 'till the end of time


And where do we go?
And I'm leaning towards
Losing my mind with this feeling no more


Ooh, better leave that war with me
Ooh, better leave that war with me
Ooh, better leave that war with me

Fair trials, they don't exist my friend
Only a circus in my mind
Judgement's gone and there's no love again

Losing my mind and I'm feeling no more

Been here before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving


Wherever I may go, whatever I might be
I may not stand alone but I am standing tall, ten toes two feet
I've never been a pushover, never asked for a handover
Worked nine five, broke day and night, if you only knew what I hurdled over


Been there before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving


Ready to take blows, suited ...
... my hands are bruised but I am still gonna stay true
Motivated by ... and the names I salute
Unbreakable I made it through and there's so much more to do


Been here before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving

I'm on a hard bench, tryna' sleep in a holding pen
Man, how the fuck did I get here again?
First thing in a morning, it‘s the fuck shit
They called the case, I got confronted by a tough snitch
He told me do it, 1 click, you ain't tell me to do it
You ain't a shooter, you a shermhead, you fuckin' loser
I fly a kite, my little man cut his sister up
He loves his bitch, you snatch her, he'll start switching up
I'm cool, I just wait ‘til my next court date
I bet he catch amnesia, then do this shit at leisure
Surrounded by Bloods, Crips, Kings, and Ñetas
Gemstars open niggas up like barettas
I'm tryna' be easy
But every now and then I gotta put it in, please believe me
You get to looking at me strange, I'm prepared Jack
A buck fifty, keep the change you can wear that



This is murder this is not music
I had your style 10 years ago
I just didn't use it
You niggas forgot how I do it
Well I do it like there' nothin' to it


Same night from the Vibe awards
Still with me looking for some new spinal cords
Fuck your life and see the mind of yours
Concrete floors, I still feel like I'm behind them doors
I want war
I'm Read up for Teed up
I'm getting fast money but I need to speed up
These Niggas kicking their feet up, just smoking their weed up
Well Ima creep up with my heat up and make em freeze up
Hold up Buck, ease up
Put some bodies in a box from Maserati fox
New York when I get there I need to hear a lot of shots
A couple chickens on a video vixen,send her on a mission and one cent better not be missing
I don't listen, I'm hard headed
Just one but you all get it my niggers all breaded its crum' just to beat the case
I see death when I see your face
And even at this pace ima still lead the race
This Buck


This is murder this is not music
I had the style 10 years ago
I just didn't use it
You niggas forgot how I do it
Well I do it like there' nothin' to it


This is Music, This is not Murder
Im Cookin' crack up on the track just so i can serve yah
Im YobyDren from DeadSea the Cliq you Probably heard of
Put any beat in front of me and i'll Murder
With my Microphone as my Desert Eagle
This shit should Just be Illegal
Haters talk..Can't hear Em' Voice is Smaller than ah Beetle
Layin' bars Sharper than some Hollow Tips
My words My Ammo excuse me while i load this Clip
When my lyrics hit your heart it tears your mind apart
This ain't Bullshit Rap homie im speakin Art
This music shit im very passionate, this shit is not an accident
Im drawn to this Hip-Hop Game just like ah Magnet
You gotta have ah Open Mind so yall can feel my rhymes
You don't have ah Open Mind then im just waistin My Time
This Is Hip-Hop Dpn't You Disrespect It
Or We'll Leave your life lookin like the inside of An Unbought Casket Bitch

I'mma take a break. Go get a new stack
Hand me that money over there

It's back to 50, you already know
Get the money, and shut the fuck up
Watch me do what I'm doin', cause niggas can't stop nothin' that I'm doin'
Right after you get in the way

My letter to the President
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up
In the hood Send mo' troops
Dear President
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up
In the hood Send mo' troops


Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin' I’ve been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
'Cause I’m seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse’ll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I’m a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody’s doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it’s 'cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don’t know, I let my pump go
Get ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President


Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo’ troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo’ troops


Oh you's a baller in the White House
I hope you comfortable 'cause yo' I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness
Amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros
And a Mr. cobra contest
With all these problems my world
Spendin' this drama on earl
My President never seen senate with pleasure like
Whatever momma tell me she hit it
No not the lottery shit
Meanin' she do what I ain't do
Break her off before I did
Slip deep into the mind of a loner
My foes say fuck him, he’s a goner
But it ain't no shorts up on these corners
On a mission
Listen, let’s ease my guard with precision
Personally my decision
When I realized this ain't livin'
How you really ain't know
How this ghetto life go
For me and all my homies, when our enemies bone
You got the C.I.A
And we got our A.K
For protection, in our section
In the felony days
To the President, 



Mr. President I represent the ghetto
Tell your wife hello, I got to go
I be brief with this pedigree
Niggas is locked and said blocks on Penitentiary life
More niggas in jail than baptized
For centuries minority families how you stay lackin'
Homeless shelters over-crowded and you still taxin'
Homies dyin' out who got the clout, not me
You get more time for five grams, than a half a key
Black poppin' rocks, and whites on the potty rhyme
And why don’t test mine, rather die than let you see me cry
Across the border ask the lord to put somebody in your seat that cares
How can we stay in this world we supposed to share
Democrats, Republicans scum me to the concrete
No education inflation's covered by white sheets
Try to ball legally conspiracy surrounds me
So I’m a outlaw from now until eternity
Forever Mussolini


Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas, actin' up


Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He’s scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein' scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain’t never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin' let him die
Can’t lie I’m a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my momma’s strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President


Blacks is broke, think it’s a joke that we livin' low?
Y’all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo’?
Tell the secretary it’s necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
'Til then we gonna keep it comin', Mr. President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President


Hehe
Word motherfuckin' life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?
Motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin' scout
Nigga this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz nigga
We fin' to hustle 'til we come up

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do

Dear Mr. Clinton… it's gettin' harder and harder for a motherfucker to make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit, I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
'Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece
I know you fear me 'cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin' you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our Glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid, think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops
You want us to fight your war, what the fuck I'm fightin' for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year, taxin' all the blacks

What did you think I'd be doing now
While you left me
I was thinking aloud
Would there be no end to my sorrow
Will I make it through tomorrow
Fate Stay With Me


Oh, Please
Fate Stay with me, and guide me along my way
There has been so many problems
So please stay, please, stay
Fate stay with me, will you help me on my way


Will you end my troubles
Will you please stay, please
I wanted money and hope and
A dream to carry me forever
This is all the hope I got left
Help me to get it together, now
I can sing or act or dance but I still won't get far
Unless you help me please to be a big star




I don't want to be a queen, no
Or a princess with all my jewels, oh
If you could guide me
And you could help me
But don't go too far, I just want to be a star




Yes guide me

Make sure you read all the story

If you are
Welcome to paradise behind the door


Like solving a mystery
It ain't easy lovin me
Boy you will soon see
I ain't easy to love
I could be more than you've ever dreamed
But it ain't easy lovin me
Aim like no flowin' streames

With just a smile
You are beguiled
Infatuation sets in
But you can't tame

Every boy wants to be like his father
In Little League, when he was coachin' me
I was hangin' on every word
Sundays, he was the one who would lead us
Taught me everything I know about Jesus
Front row, he's on a roll, and I'm hangin' on every word
It sounds nice, doesn't it?
I wish that I knew back then


There's no perfect life, you can't hold back time
But you hold on tight, hopin' you might find

Everybody expectin' perfection
Throw a ball, then you'll have it all
Best thing I ever heard
Things change in the blink of an eyelid
Guess my body knew way more than I did

Gotta fail on your way to glory
Takes time tryna get it right

Guess he must have heard my plans
And my odes, thought it was a joke
Gave me more than I could ask

In my moving around, I've played all over the world
And just about every town
Anywhere I play, they wanna know what I'm putting down

They 
They shot me at San Antone
You know they kicked me out of Kansas City
Lord, I wonder what did I do wrong

Oh, my house burned down in Boston
My wife left me in Maine
I broke both of my arms in Utah
While I catch me a fast freight train

Keeps following me, won't let me be

""How long must I be your slave?""

There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark
And I feel its warmth
In my hands, in my heart
But why can't I hold on?


It comes and goes in waves
It always does, always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood


And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away


Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space


It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood


And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away


I've watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find


It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does


And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves

Tossing your hair

A climber who climbs

Waiting to turn

Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true

What if the truth is that there is no truth
The only thing I can prove is there is no proof
Don’t be so sure that your source is correct
People believed it before, before they had checked

How many times can they tell you
Til you just give them their way
How many times can sell you
Til you let them have their say
Every time you will ignore your

Never deny your own instinct
Reconsider Everything

Everybody want something they control
Some just want grass some they want gold
Either way does it feel good or feel low
Taking you down not fast but real slow

Rebellion done for it’s own sake
Does not a true free thinker make
To go against for it’s own sake

Get me out of this place, before I cause more damage
A small price to pay for building houses out of matchsticks;
And when things get too hot, you've got me to blame
For every fire that breaks out in every lover's name


Don't forget, we've got unfinished business
Stories yet to unfold; Tales that must be retold
And I regret not knowing when to put an end to all this madness
Keeps me wanting, keeps me wanting more


Sell me out, I'm yesterday's old news
Phrases left on paper, black ink bleeding through
The pages where we made our history
Call me foolish, I feel hopeless


Running from lions never felt like such a mistake

Running from lions never felt like such a mistake

You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
I don't know why I let you do these thing to me
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good
They don't know that I would leave you if I could


I guess I'm on tight
And I'm stuck like glue
Cause I ain't never

Sometimes I know I thought
You would run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had
Kiss me once again
Don't you never never say that we are through


Because I ain't never
Never
Never no no
Loved a girl the way that I
I love you


I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got your hooks in me

Million dollar bills and a tick-tick-tick-tick

Ah put ya, ah put ya hands on ya, hands on ya heater
Hands on ya, hands on ya heater, hands on ya, hand…


Let it be prophesized; niggas'll die because your crew's doom
Around the way niggas get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones, niggas is bold and they choose to roll
I kill 'em all, watch now, nigga, truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggas dyin' by my 30 odd, brains is splattered
Wonder why these niggas cross me, I'm certified crazy
So sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, every time I ride is for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga 'cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation, runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Mama gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' niggas watch they every step
Label me a threat and I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style, baby, hands on my pistol, listen
I'm a rider, every nigga breathin' pay attention
'Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel to drop a body
A simple glimpse of my lifestyle, Killuminati…

Hold it down!

After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'Til I make it, yo, my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to bitches too scary, get too near me, we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, millions of niggas thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
Psssh! Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It’s like I’m - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked 4-5, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
Goddamn, now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati




Killuminati

Hold it down!


Hold it down!


Hold it down!



Check it, I spend most of my time hatin' niggas
Wantin' to bank niggas, because they come across as fake niggas
But we made niggas, old school in our thinkin'
While you sinkin', I comes out, fucked up, high as hell, drinkin'
Outlawz could never be bullshitters, what
We keeps it too assassin, none of y'all can deal with us
Got me thinkin' who's still with us or who haters
It don't matter 'cause put together none of y'all could take us
Y'all don't understand, I'll kill for this nigga, peel for this nigga
And when y'all dump out, be the shield for this nigga
E.D.I. Amin, ooh, Lordy Lordy
Kill 'em all for shorty, '96, it's Killuminati


They got me thinkin' strugglin' and hustlin's my only fate
Toppin' grams on the kitchen plate
Tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is where I be up on these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back, wrapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed
Thirteen, got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's, sippin' naughty thangs
Real as these tats on my body, and it's Killuminati



Hold it down!


Hold it down!


Hold it down!

Dismantled piece by piece
What's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief
Let me live and die in peace


I will be consumed, returned into the earth
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow
Cut the chord and cast me out, and cast me out


It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law

To the degree that you go with a stream
You see, you are still, you are flowing with it
But to the degree you resist the stream, then you notice
That the current is rushing past you and fighting you
So swim with it, go with it, and you're there, you're at rest""

It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own
It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own


When my heart skips two beats...
I am hidden deep, fast asleep
...The sea will part where oceans meet
Finally complete

Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law


Swan song, a declaration of endlessness
I swear I will not look back as I return into the black
When the veil lifts, how will I know, how will I know?
Will I see God?

Dismantled piece by piece

As within, so without

Just let me live and die in peace

But we got the yearn, got the skills, got the drive
Bump these hits in your whips
Cause we know they fire

We know the game, we done been around the block a few times
We heard all the Hollywood talk
Here's my card, come on down to my spot
And I'll sign you on the spot
Cause you n****s is hot
I'll throw a big show for ya'll on my yacht
I got more ends than the head of Bad Boy
And the Roc, instrumentals hotter than Timbos and the Docs
We put the chains on the game peeps will call you the LOX
You want the ice in your ring and your watch
Shorties want you to stop as you pass in the drop
Imagine traveling whenever you want
Probing the globe for the next crib you can cop
Don't waste your breath cousin you's a dime a dozen
Don't trust ya, and definitely not your words
We knew n****s saying they was, when they really wasn't
Relax playa we got this, watch and learn, watch and learn

Chorus

Verse 2: 
Excuse me but I'm about to step outta line
You stepped outta yours so I'm a step outta mine
Signing the dotted line was a waste of our time
But you burn me and you turn me from Jekyll to Hyde
We got signed to a label called Black 5
Names not necessary, but they gave us a black eye
Everything that they said that they would do was a fat lie
Yeah that *ish hurt dog, but soldiers don't cry
But we couldn't get a phone call, a email sh*t
Telling us why you gave up no details chick?
Yeah I called you chick cause that's some female sh*t
Selling pipe dreams, yo you should be in retail slick
Don't make promises that you can't keep
And if you can't keep'em please have the decency
To tell your clients cause it's ugly B
To run the risk of being dissed publicly, watch and learn

When I was sick in bed
I suppose that he told you everything
That I keep locked away in my head
Your master took you travelling
Well at least that's what you said
And now do you come back to bring
Your prisoner wine and bread

You met him at some temple
Where they take your clothes at the door
He was just a numberless man in a chair
Who'd just come back from the war
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
And he hands you the apple core
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
Of all the kisses we put on some time before

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
With a collar of leather and nails
And he never once made you explain or talk
About all of the little details
Such as who had a word and who had a rock
And who had you through the mails
Now your love is a secret all over the block
And it never stops not even when your master fails

And he took you up in his aeroplane
Which he flew without any hands
And you cruised above the ribbons of rain
That drove the crowd from the stands
Then he killed the lights in a lonely lane
And an ape with angel glands
Erased the final wisps of pain
With the music of rubber bands

And now I hear your master sing
You kneel for him to come
His body is a golden string
That your body is hanging from
His body is a golden string
My body has growin' numb
Oh now you hear your master sing
Your shirt is all undone

And will you kneel beside this bed
That we polished so long ago
Before your master chose instead
To make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
And you're speaking far too low
No I can't make out what your master said
Before he made you go

Now I think you're playing far too rough
For a lady who's been to the moon;
I've lain by this window long enough
To get used to an empty room
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
Who is tapping his foot to a tune
And your thighs are a ruin, you want too much
Let's say you came back some time too soon

Now I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew
He was starving in some deep mystery
Like a man who is sure what is true
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new
And I taught him how you would long for me
No matter what he said no matter what you'd do

Now I believe that you heard your master sing
While I was sick in bed
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head
Your master took you travelling
Well at least that's what you said
And now do you come back to bring

I'm just another nigga next up, tryin to eat




You know!
Not a soul baby!
It's all for y'all now


But it seems, y'all would rather
See me hit than, see my rich
Get bagged over some bullshit and see me snitch
Hopin' some AIDS ho bitch'll leave me sick like
I'm a sucker for love wit some easy dick
I did dirt through my days but hid my work
Even then I still made sure no kids got hurt
Sweep the next, been knowin since my feet got wet
From the best turned vet learned to speak direct
My game's jumpin, we all had our days of barkin
You could tell niggas styles by they ways of parkin
Why dispute it? Dough got us so polluted
Paranoid to the point it's like we, over-do it
Police press up, peep how the beasts arrest ya
Rough up, handcuff, then treat you lesser
Toast on me, smoke spray our potpouri
Y'all can bet I'mma rep how it's supposed to be




You know!
Not a soul baby!
It's all for y'all now
I got it locked, feel me!


Infinite game, get chills on the strength of my chain
It's only real, certain niggas mention my name
Some relate, others stay numb in the face
Tryin to keep steps ahead like we runnin a race
Nikes and Timbs, lady friends like 'em slim
Light makeup, that shit that blend right wit they skin
So what's the issue? All dick sucks is still official
Cold-steel nickles, and Phil I'm still with you
Iceberg-in, on the Turnpike mergin
Late night, right brake lights black Excursion
Tree smokin, hustle the rap I'mma keep ropin
Too many niggas got deep emotions
The stress got 'em, who else wanna express they problems?
Get upset, but real vets respect the bottom
To a false, feel a fake love or hate
Right or wrong as long as the thugs relate




You know!
Not a soul baby!
It's all for y'all now
What y'all want from me?




Yeah, y'all haters better get a hustle man, stop fuckin wit me
I'm tryin to live man, nah mean?
I been at the bottom, I was risin - fell back down
I'm tryin to climb up man
Get off my back baby
It's all a game man don't hate me hate the game

Let me show you, the rhyme..
Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses
And so does Mrs. Justice by her side
Both the broads are blind as bats, stumblin through - the system
Justice bumped into M'Tulu, trippin on Geronimo Pratt
But stepped right over Oliver and his crooked partner Ronnie
Justice stubbed her big toe on Mandela
And Liberty was misquoted by the Indians
Slavery was just a learning phase, forgotten without a verdict
While Justice is on a rampage
For endangered survivin black males
I mean really; if anyone REALLY valued life
And cared about the masses
They'd take 'em both to Pen Optical
And get TWO pairs of glasses

Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses
I'm kickin asses up and down New York City
It's a pity
Brothers wanna be grimy and gritty to each other
What would your mother think, smotherin your brother?
I see you sink, into another level
Dancin with the devil
Turn up the bass, cause I'm player; also a rhyme sayer
Kind of fly, layer after layer
Why.. cause I'm blessed
Cause I've progressed
I've learned my lessons
Class has always been in session, so you better take notes
And stop chokin on negativity

"Certo non ne ho viste mai
Belle e sexy meglio di lei
Ma a me sembra che lei è un po'
Troppo giovane per te
Ti capisco e come no?!
Se però soffrire non vuoi
Ohhh fuggi via da lei... Diana

Già io ti vedo passeggiar
Fra la gente insieme con lei
Mentre c'è chi pensa già
Che di Diana il padre sei
Ed ogni volta dover dire
Che tua figlia lei non è
Ohhh fuggi via da lei....Diana

Capricciosa bionda e rosa,morbidosa,poi golosa
Divertente, cotta al dente e tu? e tu?

E tu che non ti accorgi che lei sta cuocendoti a fuoco lento
Anche se poi chi ama di più
Fra voi due è ancora lei
Finchè un giorno ti risveglierai
Come un pugile un po' suonato
Dal travuoto che ti ha lasciato...
Fuggi via da lei....Diana

Capricciosa bionda e rosa,morbidosa,poi ...poi golosa
Divertente, cotta al dente e tu? e tu?

Tu quale non ti accorgi che non sta cuocendo soltanto me
E' a un certo punto ormai anche con te...
Forse ammetterlo tu non puoi
E sono certo che nei panni miei
Pur di stare vicino a lei
Te ne freghi degli anni tuoi
Perchè lei è ...lo sai....Diana

Già io mi vedo in un caffè
Fra la gente insieme con lei
Mentre i barman già pensan che
Che un bel giorno poi finirà
Come pugili un po' suonati
Quasi morti e innamorati...
Resta qui con noi...Diana
Qui con noi...Diana
Qui con noi... Diana

"Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin' you do will be new, cause I'm through

Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
Some can't accept but I crept inside you

So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
Cause it's Voodoo, oh

Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till you're mine and you learn

Don't look in his eyes

Pick out your clothes

Pulling out my hair

Underneath the cold moon
In the parking lot I told you
Didn't even know you'd take back the hours we wasted
We're frozen in the headlights
We're slipping on the black ice
Shouldn't have to act nice
Blood in the air, I could taste it


I found out you were mutual the night you said that you went home
You played me like a musical
Said ignorance is beautiful
I found out you were mutual the night you said that you went home
You tricked me with the dude I know the wrong


You said you wouldn't
But you did it
Why you lying?
I ain't kidding
Hands numb, can't feel
This love's not real
Now I'm finding
Your handwriting
'Cross the ceiling
Close my eyes and say, ""How'd I get here?""
This love's not real


I lost touch with who I am
I am just a hollow man
In love with a hologram
This castle is made of sand
I am just a hollow man
In love with a hologram


Double yellow lines like
Slipping in the back night
I'm losing all my lifelines
Never thought you could erase them


This world is full of hypocrites and bitches claiming innocence
Yeah I just came to witness it
And leave here with no fingerprints
This world is full of hypocrites and bitches claiming innocence
We wanted you to be the prince, but it’s incestuous

Cold sweat, shaking with the fever dream
Go back to the same crime scene
Now my ears baby won't stop ringing
My ears, yeah, they won't stop ringing
Cold sweat, shaking with the fever dream
Go back to the same crime scene

In love with a hologram
This castle is made of sand

Clean me in your river
You can wash me with your water
Purify me till I shiver
Cause I've been seeing ghosts
Is this me finally losing it?
Or an optical illusion?
Every beat I make is unfinished
And every song I write is ill conceived
When all the cities fade and we diminish
Will anyone remember you and me?

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground


Smoke on the water

Smoke on the water


They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race


Smoke on the water

Smoke on the water




We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know I know we'll never forget


Smoke on the water

"She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
And she locked the car and slipped past
Into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning
Voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other
I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
It'll make a whisper out of you

She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
The fairground's lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing that he could never do
And it'll make a whisper out of you

She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
Cops were running around the scene
Looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down
Blowing smoke from my cigarette
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out, out on condor avenue
Trying to make a whisper out of you

What a shitty thing to say
Did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now I'm leaving you alone
You can do whatever the hell you want to

Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit

And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model

Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave nigga? Go ahead, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so, ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money

Now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand
West is where I go
Through the night I plough
Still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong
I will not be led astray


Mysteries of time, clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know


I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me


Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel


I steer between the crashing rocks
The sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm
Blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now
As sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way


Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun

Lookin' into the face of the goose snow cone
Should be shaking it loose but you do it alone
Every look is a truce and it's written in stone


Gotta keep it together when your friends come by
Always checking the weather but they wanna know why
Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly


Thought I saw at my feet an origami crow
It was only the street hidden under the snow
Always snatching defeat, it's the devil I know


Gotta keep it together when your friends come by
Always checking the weather but they wanna know why
Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly


Lookin' into the face of the goose snow cone
I could pick up the pace but I couldn't go on
I just wanted a place but I ended up gone


Gotta keep it together when your friends come by
Always checking the weather but they wanna know why
Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly


Lookin' into the face of the goose snow cone

Listening to the radio, wishing that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me, man
Listen; I've got a scheme, break away, do my own thing
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, Lord knows how they hate me
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
Maybe they see me rolling, look at all this green I'm holding
I get this why they envious and get their eyes swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut

Watch them niggas out the sight of my night scope
Cooking white dope got my nigga 25-to-life stretched out
Trying to have all the better things in life
Well Makaveli — a born leader, 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader

See the meek shall inherit the Earth
And the strong will lead

How did they change, how did they change music?


Yeah, I was the wave, but now I feel the tide pullin' back
Ocean flat
Often I lay in this coffin, sleep on my back
Toss a couple of 'em back
My liver really startin' to slack
And I can feel myself decayin' from the cigarette packs
I haven't thought of $uicide since I was livin' in the back of Blackout's pad
My heart's torn in half
Now I've got everything I ever wanted, but now I don't want it
It feels like I'm haunted, it feels like I'm cursed
Hopefully soon, I'll return to the dirt
A material world with a virtual nerve
Yeah, I'll see what it's worth, throw me out on the curb
Leave me behind, walk a straight line to hell
As y'all swerve away, lost in the choice not to sell
Roll me up a blunt, aye
I need to get lost, aye
All y'all talk 'bout sauce, I'm wipin' frozen cuts with frost
I'm slicin' open guts, and tossin' frauds off to the side
Half of $uicide
A couple million, now we're ready to fucking die


Two cups and a bad bitch
Then I pop me a Xanax, quick
Call Shake when I need that fix
Call Nick when I need that itch
Call Krez just to pop on 'phetamine
Max Beck in the back; pop seventeen
Yung Kurt Cobain with the heroin
$lick love drugs over everything
Shoot the stars up in my veins, woah
But look at your bankroll
So? Just spend it on more dope
More woes, fuck you care for?
But lately, I feel guilty, I feel so badly
They say I made it, and that should be satisfactory
Lately, I feel like I have nobody
All alone in an empty hotel lobby


4 AM, praying; can I get some rest?
Dreams of $uicide and the need for death

And I used to hump on the mattress

Pitchin' the crack, it do backflips

One two, one two
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two 

Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down
Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound, it go
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two 


And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same
And when it comes to ripping mics a-yo it ain't no games
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two 


A-yo you know it's Busta Rhymes, every time
Oh yes, I'm coming wicked with a new design, I'm saying
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two 


Emcees ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay, yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come with better compositions
I write and recite to make good position
In this rap game here we engineer
Stabbing up the jam, yeah son, shit's clear
And I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way
Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-73 and C-74
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flap a shorty's pockets to the space like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gas, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll cause we in control
Take you out on your hide less you paying a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Take you out on your hide less you paying the toll


Question, why is that emcees be wack
And major labels wanna sign all that crap, a-yo funk that!
Word to life I'm coming rugged
Cause once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks remove it
Put down the mic kid, cause you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swinging when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last emcee what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's sleepless in Seattle
Rude bwoy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids like Joey Montana
We be the three emcees that make your mind go batty
Mad play on WKRP in Cincinatti
So lord send a hand and if you can't send a hand, send a man
And if you can't send a man, come yourself
Cause all these biting emcees, lord them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make your ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer ripping parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about filling one with lead
Never mind that, man, here come the dread!


We coming far far far
Busta Rhymes is coming far far far, you know you hear me, star
Bet your bottom dollar
Right after this jam about one million one two niggas gon' follow
Whether it be today or tomorrow
Niggas become aggravating, sickening, you beat them like they father
Oh shit check out what I'm saying
A-ha a-ha oh a-ha a-ha you know my niggas don't be playing
Once upon a motherfucking time
I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Mama-so mama-sa mama makossa
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Eeeyah! Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit dog sit! Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit

See I met her at club on the Friday
Big booty, small waist
Seeing her coming my way
So I had to bag her
I really had to have her 
I didn't see a ring on her finger
I asked her have you ever been with a singer before
She said no 
So let me introduce you to my world
Big diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl

Bet you ain't never seen before
Saw around the world
I got them coming back for more


And thats when I noticed
People are watching!
But we dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care 
See I bet youre nasty
When youre on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!


Got shorty right where I want her
Strapped up, hands trapped in the corner
Grinding slow, and I won't let go 
Baby more better than ammonia
Feeling tipsy from the bottle of Corona 
She probably let go 
She said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world
She whispers some words
That damn near made my toes curl
She said shes got that
That I have never seen before
And if I get the taste
Ill be coming right back for more


And thats when I noticed
People are watching!
But we dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care 
See I bet youre nasty

You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control

Im working your body
Like you are in my bedroom
YeahYeaUh-uhhYeahYeah
Everybody in the club got a clear view


But that won't stop us
Cuz we dont care!
People are watching!

The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line
I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well-disguised

I had to leave
My life behind
I dug some graves
You'll never find
The story's told
With facts and lies
I had a name
But never mind

Never mind
Never mind
The war was lost
The treaty signed
There's truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don't know which
So never mind



Your victory
Was so complete
Some among you
Thought to keep
A record of
Our little lives
The clothes we wore
Our spoons our knives

The games of luck
Our soldiers played
The stones we cut
The songs we made
Our law of peace
Which understands
A husband leads
A wife commands

And all of these
Expressions of the
Sweet indifference
Some called love
The high indifference
Some call fate
But we had names
More intimate

Names so deep
And names so true
They're blood to me
They're dust to you
There is no need
And this survives
There's Truth that lives
And Truth that dies

Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind
There's truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don't know which
So never mind



I could not kill
The way you kill
I could not hate
I tried, I failed
You turned me in
At least you tried
You side with them whom
You despise

This was your heart
This swarm of flies
This was once your mouth
This bowl of lies
You serve them well
I'm not surprised
You're of their kin
You're of their kind

Never mind
Never mind
I had to leave my
Life behind
The story's told
With facts and lies
You own the world
So never mind

Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind
I live it full
I live it wide
Through layers of time
You can't divide

My woman's here
My children too
Their graves are safe
From ghosts like you
In places deep
With roots entwined
I live the life
I left behind

Across the line

Tho many tried

Begging for something to work this time
But why can't I relate?
Feeling all I do is get what's mine
Holding on to faith
Never gave me nothing, but despair
So why do I create
Just to be swallowed?


I can't take!

I can't take!

Come what may!

I can't wait!



Been hating all this time
Before I crawled inside!
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find!
Been hating all this time
Too far to cross the line!
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find!


I cannot take this place
Burning up inside this space of mine
So why can't I replace
Feelings I find hard to really find?
I try, but I can't taste
Memories they always fuck with me
So why do I create?
Just to be swallowed

"Razor lights
On the path of progress
To gain new insight
Lose control
Give in to your senses
To reach brand new heights

When a grandeur of scenes arrives with the night
Revealing the author of fear
The reason why all of my virtues are shut down and hollow
If the light that sinks in is changing all shapes
And magic brought down to its knees
I will not be the one to lose it all over again

We will take you the mire
We will show you shattered rhymes

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted
Unlock the hidden heart inside
See the wonder of my world with true transparent eyes

Razor lights
On the path of progress
To gain new insight

If you're trying to see when all lights have gone
A silhouette without a face
Imprinting a vision that opens my eyes to creation
Its identity will reflect what I see
Control is the way to prevail
And lift up the shadows that keep me from reaching the bay

Shadows bring the night to life
Anguish harbors depth of fright

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted
Unlock the hidden heart inside
See the wonder of my world with true transparent eyes

All that is real
You alone welcome the other side

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted
Unlock the hidden heart inside
See the wonder of my world with true transparence
Deep within the forlorn stream
Lies the wonder of my world in a true transparent dream

I make progress
I walk
The path of self-mastery
Let go of all agony

That dirty old white pickup truck
With the trailer hooked up by the Denny's, she's mine
Last night's bugs on the windshield
Fast food trash on the dash meal
Speedin' ticket and a doctor bill
From a gash I got from a short go in Casper
Summer of last year, maybe next year

And I ride, and I fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones
And a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But I ride, and I roam, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know

Cell phone was breakin' up
The night she called to say she'd had enough
Of my little white lies and little white lines and wantin' somebody who could never be with her
I look back on every fork in the road
That I took to chase that buckle of gold
And wonder if what I held for what I hold is worth tradin' away
Hell I don't know, all I know

Is I ride, and I fall, one day I might win 'em all

My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is

Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right

And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is


That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah


We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive


And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years

I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
It’s very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you




There’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance




Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land


And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it’s so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique

The hours days years and the minutes
The joy the pain the sunshine and rain in it
The drives on the coast to nowhere

Got a ways to go future’s so

Come on I’m sorry
It’s 73 degrees
January easily glides

Stranger flowers still
If you’re gonna wanna go another day I will
Like this make it a deal
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a fell of impermanent bliss
Today my love we shall let the world slide
Turn off the ringer and just glide
For we shall never be younger again than

Baby, what we got is too good for goodbye
Yeah, it's too good for goodbye


Stop right there, don't say a word
Just let me hold you
Girl, we can fix whatever it is
So whatever you do
Don't let us die, the love of a lifetime
Is worth at least a million tries
Baby, what we got is too good for goodbye
Yeah, it's too good for goodbye

"With tears in my eyes, dear, I begged you to stay
You wouldn't forgive me, so you went away
My yesterdays haunt me, my weary heart cries
I just can't go on, dear, with tears in my eyes
If you ever need me, oh, please let me know
Wherever you lead me, I'm willin' to go
The past is a flower that withers and dies
I'll wake up tomorrow with tears in my eyes
With tears in my eyes, dear, I begged you to stay
You couldn't forgive me, so you went away
I made a mistake, dear, by tellin' you lies
Now I lay awake, dear, with tears in my eyes
No more to be sweetheart, no more to be friend
Just give me a chance, dear, and I'll make amends
My yesterdays haunt me, my weary heart cries
I just can't go on, dear, with tears in my eyes

Phone rang
Screen said caller ID blocked
But for some reason, I decided to answer it
On the other end, was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years
But spending these last two days with his momma and his kid
When he spoke, I wasn't trying to hear it
Cause I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he had done
He said now it's time for him to turn himself in
For no longer could he run, from life, from God
I started thinkin, ""Why is doin' right is so hard?""
I thought back to when we was in London
Discussin' the New Testament, and how our lives related to it
And how we could make the best of it
My voice became desperate, so I asked him, ""Why you gotta go?""
He said, ""You know, turn to Matthew 24""
He said, ""No one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near; don't let anything lead you astray
As long as God is with me, everything will be okay""
So right about then, we decided to pray


Just lying back, making the smoke disperse away
Deep into clouds 
It's making things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds 
Just lying back, making the smoke disperse away
Deep in the clouds 
It's making things appear to me so clearly
Deep into clouds 


Your time, is a terrible thing to waste!
For there's, not one of these possessions
That you can bring to space 
It's a challenge
But the chance of seeing it, is quite a dream to chase 
I hope, I remind God of him
When he sees my face 
He gon' see it!


Higher 
This feeling just keeps on, hehe, lifting me higher 
And it's ever flowing, it's ever flowing 
When everything, puts a smile on my face

And I recognize this strong goal
But I keeps on going
I keep on going 
I keep on going on, ohh





All mighty love, watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting 
Perfect, like, no-thing
No haze, no confusion, no strain
Simply, peace
Simply, simply, simply, simply


No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction, oh oh oh oh
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ, yeah 
Heaven, Heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge
Oh 


Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Hah  hah 
Angels sing and cymbols glare
No one's rich, no one's poor
Hah  hah 
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Hah  hah 
Wonderful dream
Wake me when you're home
Hah  hah 


Heaven? Heaven is being Pops
Heaven is spending a day with the grandchildren
Listening to they voices, and laughter and play
And then at the end of the day
We hug, we kiss, and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly, they turn and rush back to me
And hug me around the knees
Yeah, that's Heaven to me

All I did was drink all day in that hell they call L.A
A southern born man wants a gun in his hand
When he sees how they run that place
Never say I'm better than anyone
Cause Lord knows that I'm not
But that California summer wasn't that hot


We went out there searchin' for something
Instead we all got lost
We were headin' out west and the plans were goin' south
Never counted no cost
By the time I hit Arizona I was on my way to see
65 Days in L.A. is enough for me


And I would drink 'till the sun came up
And I was tryin' to find myself
But it's hard to find yourself in a state like that
I was born a runnin' man and anywhere I'm free
But 65 days in L.A. is enough for me


Been a few good folks out there any and everywhere
We were runnin' down the same things, all about insane
Thinkin' we'd find them out there
Steppin' over bums on the sidewalk
To get back to my front door
And by the middle of August, couldn't take any more


So I loaded up what little I had left
And I bought two packs of smokes
I was haulin' back to my girl, all back to my own
I was born a runnin' man and anywhere I'm free
But 65 days in L.A. is enough for me

65 days anywhere is too much for me
Too much for me

Sitting in the backseat, dead heat summer
Staring at the ground in a lucid light
I can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
Running round my head in a holy fire
Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
Freshen up the air underneath the streets
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide


And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy


'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
High on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
High on humans
High on humans


Elevate the headstrong dead long halo
Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
I can make your day glow sun to rainbow
Colour in your step, let me lose your mind
Animate the air with a stone cold question
Do you have the time? 
Do you hate your life?
Now I'm locking eyes  with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide


And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy


'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
High on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
High on humans
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
And I'm getting high, getting high
High on humans
High on humans
'Cause I'm getting high on humans

Carry me off the stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years
Is that enough for you boy?


Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do

Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think


Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head

When yo stomach keep talkin'

You clutchin' on yo forty
Voices in my head
I can't seem to to get 'em off
One sayin' stay loyal
Other tellin' me to cross 'em
Everybody say they bosses but
They really all for self
Got me thinkin' to myself
Ain't no real niggas left
Cuz all the real niggas left
They either dead or down the road
Niggas goin' out bad
They'll kill you bout a ho
Man these streets so cold, so cold
I swear these streets so cold, so cold
I pray to god that he watch my soul
And let me know whose a friend or a foe

He died right in front of me

Man my nigga Crucial too
Got me wonderin' in the streets Like
What i'm 'pose to do Like
Who i'm 'pose to trust Like
Who i'm 'pose to fuck Like
This bitch set me up Like
Imma wet her up
They gave my right hand man life
Nigga I got real stripes
I remember cold nights
TJ lost his whole life
I can't take no mo of life
But I can't let go of life
6 shots i made it out alive it's 21 for life
