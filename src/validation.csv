"Lay the work, have purpose in your plan
Get lost in the dark highway
Nobody lives under these street lamps
Kick down the door, and rest inside
Breathe easy, take your time
Moving so slowly, so slowly
Dont you bother with that lamp at night
You got to keep going, breathe easy
Gonna rush that mountain make my way to
The other side, torch the ground behind me
But there's no room, for these wicked eyes.
They cut the air like sharpened knives",Rock
"Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way
Speak your name
And I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will
I tell you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby
I want you to be all of mine
I just get so blue
Since you've been gone, baby

Since you've been gone

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips
But not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray
But ah, babe
Hear me now 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
Got to get you back somehow 
Ooh, take me back
Consider me please
If you walk in that door
I can get up off my knees
I just been so blue
Since you've been gone

Since you've been gone

Well I've been so lonely

Baby, since you've been gone

I've been so lonely

Since you've been gone

Baby baby baby",R&B
"The truth is buried under a thick layer of lies
The accidents that happened were never a coincidence
The course of history was not that unpredictable
Our way of thinking leads us in the wrong direction
Don't you think they know where you were last night?
Don't you think they know what you did last summer?
There's nowhere you can go undetected
The all seeing eye is there all the time
They decide what's right or wrong
The words you speak, every word you read
They'll put you away, enemy of the state
Every move you make
Every step you take
All the tings you read
All the things you like
They're checking you
Enemy of the state
The truth will be buried under a thick layer of lies
All accidents that'll happen will never be coincidence
The course of the future will never be unpredictable
Our way of thinking should lead us in the right direction
They decide what's right or wrong
The words you speak, every word you read
They'll put you away, enemy of the state
Every move you make
Every step you take
All the things you read
All the things you like
They're checking you

"So we all bend down to reason pure and simple
and its reasonable to a ache upon the tail
and like soldiers who are driven on to battle
there are those of us who question not at all
so we all bend down to reason pure and simple
and we file inline as battle general's call
and the pragmatists logistical tactician
leads technocrats to doom without delay
and like astronauts with wings of pure intention
our rocket ships burn fuel of yesterday
while tomorrow is a distance near stagnation
when material growth will eat the world away
when material growth will eat the world away
so we all bend down to reason pure and simple
and its reasonable to ache upon the tail
and like soldiers who are driven on to battle
there are those of us who question not at all
there are those of you who question not at all",Rock
"I'm winning , yeah I made it,
But I've been raising Cain.
Cuz the path I'm on seems much the same.
But in the cold night,
I can't help but ask for more
Seems to be the pain
That I've been asking for
So wash me in the water
Take it all away
Wash me in the water, Take away this pain
 Wash me in the water
 Wash me of it all
 Wash me in the water, before my fall.
And I've changed, Lord I've changed, the man I used to be.
I've hurt you far too much fore I could see.
But in the cold night
I'm sure I'll find a way
To drag you under
And bring you down again
So wash me in the water, Take it all away
Wash me in the water, Take away this pain
 Wash me in the water
 Wash me of it all
 Wash me in the water, Before my fall
All these days just pass me by now
Ending up the same
Lord all those days just pass me by now
Just ending up just the same
Ending always the same, ending always the same, ending always the same, and always the same
 Wash me in the water
 Take it all away
 Wash me in the water, Take this pain
 Wash me in the water
 Wash me of it all
 Wash me in the water, Before my fall
 Wash me in the water
 Take it all away
 Wash me in the water, Before I fall
 Wash me in the water
 Wash me of it all
 Wash me in the water, Before I fall
Well if I had it my way
Lord, if I had it anyway",Hip-Hop
"From the haze in your chambers
To the legs on the stage
I'm consumed by your danger
I can lose my restraint yeah
I can take you even further
Oh yeah I
I'll let you enter
From the stage
We shoot our guns
Then we sail off into the sun
While the cold world freezes on
The view from the trails from the vapors
That we burn from a kiss
Heats the stars that we strangle
And it's proof we exist
I can take you even further
Oh yeah I
I'll let you enter
From the stage
We shoot our guns
Then we sail off into the sun
While the cold world freezes on",Folk
"
If I don't act myself when I'm around you
And I recall the things you used to say
Well I just haven't learned to forget like you do
But it's only love it'll go away
It's only love it'll go away
At least that's what you say
And if I call at night when you're sleeping
Just to talk about yesterday
Then before I hang up these mem'ries start creeping
Well it's only love it'll go away
But it's only love it'll go away",Country

"We fell into a new reality
A world of glass all around
Every move could make it shatter
Every step could break it down
But I kept searching for more...
A little bit more would satisfy
Just a little bit more to fill the void.
Little have I known
I have cracked the glass
All around
All that running
All that searching
Everything came crumbling down
The glass shattered all around , slicing through me
I should have valued what I had
Now I beg for a second chance",R&B
"For whatever might have been
And all that it never was
Whatever I couldn't see
for all that I didn't want
There was a method to my madness girl
That wasn't clear to me
Until the day I saw your face
When I saw everything
For I saw us dancing through sunshine and rain
And I saw us laughing through joy and through pain
And I saw time passing but we did not change
And I still saw us together at the end of every day

Whenever you want it
Whenever you need it
Whatever you feel like, it's gon' be like
You better believe it
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone, no
You know, you know, you know
You should already know
I choose you 
I felt you inside myself
Before I could even feel
I knew you like no one else
But still I couldn't tell, Oh
Girl, none of it made sense to me
Girl, none of it was real
Until the day I saw your face
And it was clear to see
Whenever you want it, no
Whenever you need it, no
Whatever you feel like, it's gon' be like
You better believe it 
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone, no 
You know, you know, you know
You should already know
I choose you 

Throughout our times, people have searched their lives
Hoping that they might find the chance where they can make things right
Through my desire, thank God I found the fire
Oh, for everything has led me straight to you 
Whenever you want it
Whenever you need it
Whatever you feel like, it's gon' be like
You better believe it
Whenever you feel like dancing
You don't have to dance alone, no
You know, you know, you know
You should already know
I choose you 
I choose you ",R&B
"I won't climb the highest mountain I won't swim the deep blue sea
I won't brave a raging river I'm no hero on TV
Well there are other ways to prove my love if you're not too choosy
I'd swim the deep blue swimming pool climb the highest barroom stool
Brave the raging waters of a hot tub or Jacuzzi
Honey I'd live for you that'd be a lot more fun
Work and give to you vacations in the sun
No I wouldn't die for love like the poets say they'd do
I love you so much honey I'd live for you
So put down that romance novel I'm no sheik upon a steed
It might make you think this working man isn't what you need
I won't cross the desert sands for you to prove my love is blazing
But I'd crawl on my hands and knees across a king size bed for these
Two lips of yours that always please me isn't love amazing
Honey I'd live for you...

I'd swim the deep blue swimming pool climb the highest barroom stool
Brave the raging waters of a hot tub or Jacuzzi
Honey I'd live for you...
No I wouldn't die for love like the poets say they'd do
I love you so much honey  I'd live for you",Country
"Don't put your eyes down
You're not to blame
I know there are stories
You can't explain
But if I should find you black and blue
And aching from crying, I'll wait with you
Grow, grow
Oh, so you know it all
Then it's gone
Grow, grow
You know I'm here holding on
Tying up your loose ends
And you're drifting esteem
Grow, grow
If you never try, you'll never know
I've left you a white page by the door
There's no need to ask me what it's for
I wait by the front step for your return
And hear every story of what you've learned
Oh, so you know it all
Then it's gone
Grow, grow
You know I'm here holding on
Tying up your loose ends
And you're drifting esteem
Grow, grow
If you never try, you'll never know

Beware of the Ska Robot Army!

"Lost touch, long ago,
It didn't end so well, I know
Lashed out, had a row
Don't know where home is for you now
Your drink should not have stayed undrunk
You should have drunk it down with your prayers
I showed no mercy to you then
No mercy when
Chorus
A glass unkissed by human lips
A glass untouched by human hands
A glass unbroken cut the skin
'till we bled
A glass unkissed by human lips
A glass untouched by human hands
A glass unbroken cut us both
'till we bled
Lost all in the end
Threw out the suffering of a friend
Let's hope life is kind
And will deliver peace of mind
Forgive this crazy one
Her crazey time in hell
She keeps her silence now
And means you well",Folk
"Busy with this special thing that takes me far away,
Living for the music if the spirit's gone, why did it fade.
I see you every once in a while, so little I can say,
I know how things have gone for you, you seem so far away. 

Tied up, tied up in rhythm, that's my crime to you!
And everything keeps getting tied up, tied up so tight, I don't know why.
You walked beside me, every step, until a dream had found,
A spot that drove me harder, and harder I keep pushing on,
I hope you won't forget me, the way I treated you,
Until I slow down a bit, I don't know what to do. 
",R&B
"Fear
You're just a name that I have learned
Another way for me to turn
And you brought me here
And it took years for me to find
That you were only in my mind
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
Hope
You're just a name that I hold close
There when I needed you the most
And you brought me here
Where I can learn to love myself
Without the love of someone else
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
All I want is love
All I want is love
I don't care what they all say
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care what they all say 
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care if my heart breaks
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
I don't care what they all say 
I don't care if my heart breaks 
I don't care what they all say

"
One by one goes the bullets in the clip
Put it in yo gat, one in the chamber, now you're ready to start shit
Heat comin from the barrel with a cloud of smoke
Dead bodies on the ground when these fools get loc'ed
It's crazy in the street, pack some heat for a sucker
Mobbin through the town tryin to murder muthafuckas
211's every day, liquor store and bank jobs
D boys gettin robbed, niggas get jacked for they mobbs
What's a nigga to do, can't survive without a gun
Snitches in the street, a nigga livin on the run
It's fun but the pen is like smokin sess
Locked up on a 187'll make any nigga stress
You can wear a vest, it won't stop two to the head
Shot you in your face and now your ass is better off dead
Talkin shit'll get you smoked quick
No need to save a hoe because they can't live without dick
So I focus on the mail, Celly Cel
Ain't no playa-hatin nigga, I got too much heat to sell
Fairy tales I never kick, it's gangsterism in my veins
I kicked it with the O.G.'s pickin up on game:
Get your money on, fuck a bitch and get ghost
And keep one in the chamber for them fools that play you close
Them Sick Wid' It niggas keep makin the beat 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

Some heat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
Them Sick Wid' It nigga got the beat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
That nigga Celly Cel got some heat 4 yo azz

Them Sick Wid' It niggas got the beat up comin with some heat
Them federal muthafuckas tryin to get a buck in the streets
Every day a nigga want to test yo skill
And playa-hatas hate to see a nigga comin real
The H-i-double l-s-i-d-e
Down with the P.G., niggas don't want to see me
Act a fuckin fool, shootin up the city
Happy on the trigger like my nigga Frank Nitty
Let's get into the see thang, Hillside slang
It's a Hillside thang from the Hillside, mang
Smokin em like a chronic sack, rollin em in a zag
Hittin em with the funk and zippin em up in bodybags
Everywhere I go fools get to actin crazy
want to let they nuts hang, thinkin they can fade me
So I keep a life-long mug on my face
Rollin with some heat, sippin on a straight lace
A high speed chase, bank it in the side pocket
Po-po's can't fuck with the 350 rocket
Under my hood it's all good when I'm on the gas
Checkin the rollers and the jackers that try to blast
Tricks of the trade already made, gangster got it down
Never panic under pressure when it's goin down
Droppin a bomb, nigga, mobb beats 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz


Breakin em off somethin proper for the nine-fo'
In the do' is some of that heat 4 yo azz, hoe
Little hoes and the don't-know's need to know
A nigga that flow who ain't comin out the gate slow
Pimpin and and pandlin, hoe handlin the whole bit
Killers move in silence, nigga, I don't talk shit
I see them loudmouth niggas keep gettin dead
And the silent ones on 25 to life bids
You gotta pack some heat in the street, it's goin down
If you ain't down you better move to a square town
Niggas talk shit, drink and smoke weed up
Hit the county jail straight p.c.-ed up
You never know who really down till the funk jump
Same one that jump and the finger points at the punk
And your crew wasn't down from the get-go
Don't you know how that bitch-made nigga shit go?
Hollow points get to the point quicker
Cause talkin shit full of liquor thinkin that you're sicker
Than the next nigga'll get you full of bullet holes
Stayin on my toes and I just can't let go
Of this mobb shit that I kick 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

"One hour ahead of the posse
the bloodhounds are hot on my trail
last night I shot my sweetheart
this morning I broke out of jail
my Pinto is tired and hungry
and I'm feeling weary and warm
we started ahead of the posse
and we got to keep going on
the sherrif aswored he would get me
he's riding with 20 and 5
but I'm not afeared of that posse
they never will get me alive
One hour ahead of the posse
no turning to left or to right
we must win the race to the river
or there'll be a hanging tonight
one hour ahead of the posse
no time for remorse or regret
but somehow her eyes still haunt me
her laughter is taunting me yet
it started the night that we might
she kissed me and vowed she would care
I traded the gold in pocket
to fondle the curls in her hair
she lied when she told me she loved me
she lied with each kiss that she gave
she lied to the moment I caught her
and now she lies still in her grave
on hour ahead of the posse
the night is a-coming on fast
we must win the race to the rio
and well shake that old posse at last
we're nearing the end of our journey
and now I'm inside of my goal
at last we've beaten the posse
- gun shot -
may the Lord have mercy on my soul",Folk
"A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
A sunny day with hopes up to the sky a kiss and no goodbye
That's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me that you care
Remember when you give you also get your share
Don't let me down I have no time to wait
Tomorrow might not come when the dream is dreamed too late
A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you

That's all I want from you

That's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me
That's all I want from you",Country
"Yes, people it's time to take the train
To another place of positive elevated experience
And existence, for this is a journey
To a place where only the Dolio-Flow can take you
Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
'Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show
Dolio-Flow, come take me home
Around, around, around, around the sons of the flow we goin'
Around the underground to spread the sound about the DFLO
Let me give your ears a baptismal
Dip into the pool and let me chisel
Chunks of ignorance out your brain system
As I implant wisdom in the name of DFLO
Here we go with this, let me flow with this
Holy glory, how the dolio flow in this
Wanna serve em' natural learning
Shooting it like sperm to the egg in your head
DFLO is my bread and the body in my cup
Just like it says in the scrolls
And just as sure as Moses used to write on a rock
I'm glowing cause I'm knowing that the DFLO'll stop
Swing low and take me home riding on a breeze of air
There ain't no fare, the only fee is just believe and it'll drop
Pee is a believer so I'm waiting in the zone
For DFLO, DFLO to take me home

If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show

Now I don't want to be a dope man, listen
I didn't have a dime, a nickel, penny, a pot to piss in
See all my clothes had holes and they fit tight
Pray to God 'cause it's hard trying to live right
Waiting on the train can't hang with the street gangs
Making me insane, putting rain on my whole brain
But the train means change to better thangs
Can't live with the negative and ghetto pains
Can't be late, can't wait to get to where we're going
Almost ten to four and I'm sure that the train is showing
But I ain't sure where it goes, I don't really know it
But I got faith, that's all it takes to get to where we're going
Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
'Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show
Dolio-Flow, come take me home
Now I'm dreaming about a trip to paradise though
I don't know where it is I really want to go tonight
So I can move on and find a place that's right fo'
Me to be me and my eyes to see the light though
We've been waiting for something real
And we just can't wait no longer
We need something that we can feel
We need something that's much much stronger
But how long do we gotta keep waiting?
How many years of anticipation?
I can't stand the rain, the racism
All the pain and the aching, so I'm dreaming of escaping
Yo, my man, you know how to get to the shuttle?
I'm trying to find the underground
Yeah man, it's right over there, right over where?
Is you deaf or something? Can't you hear it?
Look, you ain't telling me nothing
Just go ahead and get on the train
Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home
So I'll sing another funky song
Just until another one comes along
But I hope it don't be too long
'Cause I know I'm gon' do something wrong
If tunnel don't glow and the shuttle don't show

Now I hope it don't be too long
Waiting on a train come to take me home

And I, longed for you.
Yes I, long for you.

Yes, I'll move for you

"By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
Cause I've left that girl so many times before
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lounch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall that's all
By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She didn't know that I would really go",Country

I thought it was a dream
At first we learned to walk
Then learned to scream

When you're fed from a TV screen
You can't see the things that I can see
But I forget that you thank god and pray
Some things just never stay
And we all just slip away
This cant be the real world now
I don't believe it
When I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world now
When all our carried in now just to poison you
Am I
The only one who thinks it's tragic?
This cant be the real world now
No oh uh no oh
I look for some hope in every face that has a vacant stare
The shadows come but no one seems to care
The darkness floods every light that promised change

Somewhere I know that I'm not all alone
This bated breath I hold
My lungs want to explode

"I find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home

Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day,
You know it's always been that way

And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy, heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop 
The girl is right on time now 
Her loving arms are there to greet me,
Her tender lips are there, always there to meet me.
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way

One women's making my home

The other girl is making me do wrong
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no baby
I got to decide where I belong.

Sometimes I get so mixed up inside

I wish I could find a place to hide
I didn't mean, I didn't mean
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no girl
I got to decide, where I belong

"Another day is coming
A new day has begun
An eagle is rising slowly to the skies of no return
Disappearing in the growing sun
So proud and so beautiful
Thinking about tomorrow with tears in his eyes
Once a lot of brothers spread their wings to join his way
Now he's left alone in a world of lies
Cry for tomorrow
Why don't we hear the eagles cries
Living in sorrow
Why don't we help him to survive
Once a dignity, a mighty sign of pride
Strong and proud and free
A symbol of eternity, why don't we see
We can't survive, if we don't realize
Our world is a place that can't be created twice",Metal

Night in the mountains comes with the fly of a raven
Carpathians bathed in the light of the moon
In old ruins where the dying shadows
Are watching the shine from the stars
Nobody remembers days of glory
Several hundreds years passed in silence
Not a soul has been seen here
I am standing on a hill
So silent is the sky
I am drinking the cold of this night
Old grey wolf lying upon my feet
Is licking the hand of mine
It is night...in my heart
It is moon...in my eyes
I am hidden in a fog- my own breath
Small village in a valley
Sleeping in a fear, in a fear of me!
Loathsome race of the mortals
magic of wolfish teethes, wings of bats
Faithful guards of religion
Old as the blood itself
The cult of the undead
Vampirism
Frenzy of lust, frenzy of pain
She was only fourteen
No cry has burst from her lips
Pity that she had to die
but how sweet was her neck
It is night...in my heart
It is moon...in my eyes
I am hidden in a fog
My own breath
Sometimes only my anthem of triumph
Echoes in mountains landscape
Like blood from thorn opened arteries
Poison flows down the tongue
Somewhere far away a howling can be heard
Oh, how beautiful is the night in Transylvania!
Frenzy of lust, frenzy of pain
Blood is life...ETERNAL!",Metal

 I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangster, let the 40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than 'Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot, the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doin life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Then break up the streets of Compton
Spread my blood in the pavement

Let me paint this picture while you sit here
Thinkin in the back of your mind, this is the shit, yeah

Ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier

Put us in the same cage, and I'mma have to peel him

Swam all across the ocean blue

You made me feel like a million bucks

"Why do you stand by the window
Abandoned to beauty and pride
The thorn of the night in your bosom
The spear of the age in your side
Lost in the rages of fragrance
Lost in the rags of remorse
Lost in the waves of a sickness
That loosens the high silver nerves
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love
Oh tangle of matter and ghost
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints
And the whole broken-hearted host
Gentle this soul
And come forth from the cloud of anoint
And kiss the cheek of the moon
The New Jerusalem glowing
Why tarry all night in the ruin
And leave no word of discomfort
And leave no observer to mourn
But climb on your tears and be silent
Like a rose on its ladder of thorns
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love...
Then lay your rose on the fire
The fire give up to the sun
The sun give over to splendour
In the arms of the high holy one
For the holy one dreams of a letter
Dreams of a letter's death
Oh bless thee continuous stutter
Of the word being made into flesh
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love...

To tell the old, old story

What seems each time I tell it more wonderfully sweet
I love to tell the story for some have never heard
The message of salvation from God's own holy Word

We're man and wife we might as well be friends
You don't kiss me like you used to kiss me
Sometimes I take that there must be somebody new
And when I come home at night you act like you didn't even miss me
Lately honey I've even had my doubts about you
We used to face the world and life together
We used to talk of our ambitions and our dreams
But lately we've been takin' our love for granted
We have time for everything except each other it seems
Let's take time out...

I'm a good ol' boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee,
But she carries me, when my sins make me heavy,
And she loves me like Jesus does.

Both my broken wings,
Every single piece of everything I am,
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't,
She forgives me when I can't,
And the devil man, he don't stand a chance,
Cause she loves me like Jesus does.
Always thought she'd give up on me one day,
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway,

"
I got a little story to tell
See it was September 1st, 1999, the day of my death
My back was on the cold concrete as I take my last breath
Saw my body laying on the ground as my soul hovered above me
Damn Eyedea you was a good lookin' cat
But anyway another day at 18 years of age
Step in heaven's gate anxious to see what God got to say
Maybe he'll give me a gift for always saying my prayers
But he might send me downstairs for last year's love affair
Well who cares
You know right now it's all a mystery
I mean I'll find out when I get there
Until then I can't let it get to me
I'm keepin' my cool
Besides everybody dies
I'll just follow the white light like the do in the movies
It seems like I was went by and I'm still travelin
Right towards the brightness
Now this ain't heaven of hell
This realm is lifeless
And I hate to say it
But this wild goose chase had me bored
No directions, no clues, no idea what I was in for
But forward I kept floating
And then a quick flash the lights split directly in half
And created a forked path
Representing each side is an angel
Now whats the task I have to untangle to meet the big man in charge I ask
And one on the right of me says one of us always lies and one that always tells the truth
Ask the right one the right question he'll direct you to heaven
If ask the wrong one son, farwell you going straight to well....
Y'all get the picture
The one on my left told me not to listen to his fibs
He said it ain't that complicated to find out where god lives
He told me to follow his path
and tell god that he said hi
Then the one on my right jumped in and told me not to believe his lies
and I'm like Jesus Fucking Christ
I didn't care much for life
But I've tried to stay alive forever if I knew this is what death was like
I was never good at problem solving especially in emergencies
I get a tad bit nervous when concerned with burning for eternity
but anyway I asked them which one lied and they pointed at each other
Thinking I'd had it I asked the name of my mother
One said he don't know the other said he know but he can't tell me
God damn this is going to be hard
So I asked 30 questions and I still wasn't sure
but being me I gave those pricks a few good words
Frustrated with it all
I turned my back to the angels and when I walked away to my surprise
I found myself in heaven

I Walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven...
I Walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven...",Hip-Hop

debes saber que estas muy equivocada,

terminada. El primer paso yo no lo voy a dar,
sigo tu rumbo si el orgullo te gana,
te juro que de veras eres extraÃ±a,
sabes que fallas pero no dices nada solo callas
si estas pensando muy en serio mi amor
que tus caprichos valen mas que los dos,

Llevate suficientes cosas mi amor porque el camino es largo
y yo no intento detenerte, que tengas mejor suerte,
me duele decir esto corazon pero yo se que tengo razon,

Verse 1
When I think of special thoughts
I remember special feelings we shared
And when I think of special moments
Those were special times you told me you cared

When autumn comes the leaves will flow away
But I know right now Your love will always stay, oh
I know You will love me forever, hey
Dont You know Your love cant get any better, no, oh
Chorus
Last song forever
I couldnt love You no better
Than I do right now
And now means forever
Verse 2
And when I think of how I truly feel
One day well be together always
Though time has changed so many, many things
Through it all, through it all our love has remained the same

"My father was a lawyer, mom's at university
My brother and my sister, they both have their Ph.D.
My grampa was a pilot shooting Nazis from t he sky
But I am the most famous, I'm a TV weather guy
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke
H e always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke
Thinks a meteorologist knows what falls from the sky
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy
They said that I'm not qualified to be on the TV
Don't know Celsius from Fahrenheit so I just say degrees
I just read the temperatures and make up a bunch of lies
And end up being right more than the guy on channel five
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke
He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke
Thinks cloud are made from cotton that have blown up to the sky
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy
On Saturdays I must be out of bed by five A.M.
Put on a ton of make-up and then stare at the camera lens
Greeting all the viewers with a ""Hi-hi-hip-hello!""
'Cause it's the day I have to host a kiddie cartoon show
He smiles at the camera then to his puppet sock
He raves about the crayon drawings of the family dog
Did a promo at the shopping mall and made the children cry
He's a lousy clown but a good TV weather guy
They said that I'm not cute enough to be an anchorman
Not tough enough for sports and for the arts I was too bland
But I know that some day I will reach my TV goal
When I guest star on Baywatch or 90210
'Til then I'll smile at the camera and tell a little joke
He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke
He wonders why big storms are always named for other guys
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy

Now you wear skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Well, Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
And nobody heard his dyin' words
Ah but that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
Could of had him any day
Only let him any day
Hang around
Out of kindness I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to

Ended up in Lefty's mouth

And my string of failed attempts
Cause you think that its important
And I welcome the sentiment
And we'll talk on the phone at night
Until its daylight and I feel clever
Then I hear a slow in your speech

And I'm selfishly dispossessed

I heard the boy he said OOH OH
The party people he said OOH OH
Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo
Check it, check it
Driftin on a memory, brought forth
from a fifth of Hennesey, as in times
of eighty-nine they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggaz be fuckin girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin over if he said, ""Dumb bitch""
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh
It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh

and start thinkin they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin
Saved my day, dancin on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pourin
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
and started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the taste
Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
at em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
remindin me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late callin broads hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes havin bakeouts
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out
Then everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin in
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin in

"Don't let this call bother you in any way
I just had to hear your voice one more time,
I know you've made a new life, a new life without me,
But I'm alright, I just had you on my mind.
Oh, you sound so close, I can almost feel your touch
And remember the way, you loved me
I don't know what went wrong, all I know is that your gone,
But I'm alright, I just had you on my mind.
I'll hang up in a minute, it's been good talking with you
I guess you want to go now, you've got other things to do
Please don't think I'm blue, I just happen to think of you
But I'm alright, I've just had you on my mind.

"Play heed this take of the prince of darkness,
Whom we're taught to fear from day number one.
The beguiling serpent, king of the underworld,
Betrayer and mocker of heaven's chosen one.
Evil and wicked dreamer, creator of sins,
Ultimate deceiver; longing to take you in.
He promises earthly glory, if you play his game;
""I won't let the firebombs hurt you, just
Number your head and take my name.""
Belial begins his scheming, treacherous plan,
Turns brother on brother, toys with the leaders of man.
He creates before them illusions of broken truce,
A wicked plot of deception, that commanders cannot refuse.
In a short time he has control,
USA, Russia, chaos from pole to pole.
Mankind's worst nightmare, it's too late to pray,
Hold tight and take your last breath,
The missiles are on their way...DOOMSDAY!
All over the earth the horror begins,
This time there's no second chance.
Firebombs...deathly flash, vapors spread so fast,
In a moment the world is ash.
There in the midst stands the deceiver
Bearing a brooding smile.
Surrounded by his marked believers,
The masses of unscarred.
Evil's reign, called by the prophets,
Under a darkened sky,
Ghastly sins everywhere, unmarked survivors
Sacrificed as demons dance.
Suddenly, the hordes are silenced,
By the rumbling planed, metalbeast soon to appear,
To challenge the enemy, to deal his doom,
To write the devil's dirge...Doomsday!
The scorched ground opens, the beast of metal appears,
Satan and his army show no sign of fear.
Across desert plains, through city streets,
In the hills evil meets defeat.
Covens one by on fall by metal's hand,
As the dark forces weaken.
The monster rages through the battles,
To confront the master of sin.
As the night falls, the beasts, they meet
And the existing numbered line along the street.
The air is charged with power metal,
Flotzilla's eyes glow as he feeds.
The clash begins, a fight 'til death,
Such power never seen before.
Thrashing jaws, slashing claws,
Dealing the darkside's fate;
The deceiver's doom this day...DOOMSDAY!",Metal

The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn style boy you know what I'm sayin?

R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P-A-see, R.I.P enough of that shit niggas that want to OD
Aiyyo the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize nigga I'm straight from the street
These industry niggaz is startin to look like somethin to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ""You want to see her again?""
Dance your ass down to the nearest ATM
I have dreams of fuckin an R&B; bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure,son it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweatin starin down the barrel of my nine
Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, ""Tell your man
Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
I mean right now""
The only excuse for being broke is bein in jail
An entertainer can't make bail he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plottin to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin to live for
Don't want a nigga puttin four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Case like ""Dude get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no more where you getting chips from now??
I been skeamin on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick

About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?
 2x
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

Ill catch P and Silk The Shocker right after the Grammies
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timberland and Missy w/the pound

Niggas been robbin Joe before that's why his ass

Mad at you I'm robbin J.D., FUCK YOU!! PAY ME!!

DMX want to get down or will you tell on me
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my +Dirt All By My Lonely+
I should rob Clue man his shit did well
I want to stick TQ but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios take niggas shoes and leave
Catch Rae Ghost and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three
Ill beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Cannibus want to battle while I'm stickin them up
Fuck a cab the coroners pickin em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, hey nigga I saw ya
He said ""Why you robbin me I got _Nuttin But Love_ for ya!""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
One at a time get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep stickin niggas until I'm livin
I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real I'm bout to stick Mister see
That nigga still eatin off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enuff I told him ""Gimme Some More""

Box of Altoids for my paranoid niggas actin' foul
Stop smokin' if you can't be proud

Inglewood players actin' right in the spotlight
Me I'm righter than invisible set
I'm visibly wet, slurrin' and I'm lookin' for my pet
I pass to the massa with her whip on her, ask her
If she sippin' wit'cha bird, if she not we move past her
And I ain't hatin' I'm just diggin' ya ass girl
Is that the collagen shot, is that what'cha momma got?
I'm so rugged, bullet wound in back
of the axe handle blunt force trauma kinda tuggin'
And I ain't never been what the cat drug on
B-Real Quik's to keep ya mean muggin'
California clownin', bounce to sundown
In the moonlight groovin', trippin' off the saloon fight
We Fandango, the next day hangover
got me feelin' like I hit a train with my Range Rover

Feel free to lose your mind, let'cha brain go
Fuck the tango do the Fandango
Triple step, right left, then you let'cha dame go

Take your doo rag off, let your brain grow
Fuck the tango do the Fandango
Triple step, right left, then you let'cha man go
Spin around 'til you get a hangover
Watch me climb out the whip with the bird on my hip
She wanna set it off in the club, don't trip
We crack a bottle and all my fam take a sip
Any haters wanna pop at the lip, we come equipped
We get the paper and the savor the flavor
but never forget about the haters who constantly imitate us
Homey we creators and players and rhyme sayers
for layers of words, let me say it in terms that you can understand
So clearly, you feelin' me fam?
She's on the floor cause of my homey Quik man
And she hits the mall but you don't really understand
Yeah I seen it before but now it's gettin' out of hand
Mami's diggin' for more, and she's posin' for the cam
Little beef got the dance floor slammed
No tango, straight Fandango
Birds flock to us like heads to Kangols, c'mon

Feel free to lose your mind, let'cha brain go
Fuck the tango do the Fandango
Triple step, right left, then you let'cha dame go
Spin around 'til you get a hangover
Take your doo rag off, let your brain grow
Fuck the tango do the Fandango
Triple step, right left, then you let'cha man go
Spin around 'til you get a hangover
I'm a master in disguise, movin' swiftly to the thighs
Move faster than me, then I recognize
That I ain't really got nothin' to hide
But the bratwurst skinny girl second, fat girls first
And Compton is still on my mind
I remember when we used to get scared when they got behind us
One-time sayin' they been tryin' to find us
But they got the wrong niggas, never mind us
My tongue tumbles like I'm bumblebee stung
Rip out the stinger, you keep talkin' shit I whip out the ringer
How many times does it have to end
right before 12:00 A.M., why you packin' a Slim Jim?
I gets down on the mic like I rode down on a bike
Road rash, skin peelin' tonight
The club ain't never crackin' 'til the haters be gone
We need to build the eliminator hater light, and put it on 'em

Feel free to lose your mind, let'cha brain go
Fuck the tango do the Fandango
Triple step, right left, then you let'cha dame go
Spin around 'til you get a hangover
Take your doo rag off, let your brain grow
Fuck the tango do the Fandango

And now look where I'm at

And I can see the grass
Bid you siyanora

Get what I want
Say what I can

Show up again
Don't dig the food
Don't want the drink
Dry out in style
Waste all my ink
I'm checkin' out past noon

Over darkest hours
We left no trace at home
But saw our footprints ahead

Stardust would shine our way
There was a beautiful vision that night
All shades were bright
With hope to catch the sight

And touch a cooling star
We watched the moonstones
Swim in brightest colors
Reached for horizons
To touch the line that separates earth from sky
Stardust would shine our way

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
'Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then

Wont you leave your mark on me?
If we ever make sweet love again,
I'm sure that it will be quite disgusting.

Empty, bitter, boring, and hollow.

But, love, you're a strange fella
Show Eve your mark and let 'er be.

We are travelling to a new age and to another land
Are we afraid of what's behind
Or perhaps what's to come
Once there was a promise
A name would free us from all lies
A word would unite all the dreamers
That day was last year
They are all the same
Only greedy gods
In autumn yellow we saw him rise
We had wished for a savior
But the newborn was the opposite
In his glowing eyes we saw nothing but hate and greed
The great hall was soon filled with our own blood
Fear was spread across the land
Our king was weak and soon died away
With his kingdom the crown fell
No one's left there to the story tell
We were the last ones to escape

Real girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp!
Step into club looking just like a pimp
We got cash, so we screaming out ""shake something bitch!""
This is the song, tell the DJ put it on
Micheal Tyler made you shake
Sisqo made you show your thong
Bitch I'm dead wrong!
The playa from the crib
So get out on the floor
And girl, get it how you live
And since you so hot
Fuck it, show your pussy lips
You go to Tougaloo, but I know you still flip
Bitch, don't trip! Ain't a damn thing changed
I still love my queen
But bitches keep me to the game
So if you gotta ho, shake em up and let em go
And let them girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp!
Real thugs get down on the floor
Real girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp!
Now don't you hate them old
Lying ass hoes?
Smiling in your face
Wearing her best friend's clothes
I suppose they like the way me and Banner pimp
You can catch us at Pappadeaux
Eating steak and shrimp
Or you can catch us at E&J;'s pouring it up
Flip whipping Cali trucks
Girls licking my nuts
We some Southside pimps
And we ain't giving a fuck
Poke your girl up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut
We make em swallow the nut, so
Follow the truck: Lil Flip and David Banner
We got all of the bucks, and
All of they sluts and all of the hoes
So drop it like it's hot, girl
Touch your fucking toes
Go on, touch your toes, and
Make me a roll and go on - hit the mall
And buy me some clothes, mane
And if your boy trip, I'mma bust a clip
Y'all bitches can't fuck with me and Lil Flip!",Hip-Hop

That he could touch in the sky just to get his people high

Playing the streets like and instrument
Pulling strings wherever he went
Angel sent from the sky just to get his people high

Fast cars and sound

And freedom he was bound

Couldn't see the ground

Jimi come out why don't you set me free?

So high born to fly
Getting high off his own supply
Everybody follows the same Lord
Using his light to guide the way
Try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung
Everyone hides their face
Sets behind a mask they wear
Jimi come out, why don't you set me free?
Jimi come out, why don't you set me free?

I say I don't love you but the truth comes out at night

Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed

I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps til they head splits, then break em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin Tecs, because I be stayin vexed
Some nigga named Dex, was in the projects layin threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin
I'm chokin enemies til they start turnin pale
Satan said I'm learnin well, Big L's gonna burn in hell

Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up, they said a real man
Won't hit a girl well I ain't real cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price, I'm the type
To snap in heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest

""Can I get your autograph L?"" No bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with L

"Descending through thickened mist
An old man reached inside and tore out my slumber
Ivory twists an open claw
Set upon the skulls of man
Formative years aside
Truth blanched in sun's delusion
But providence affirmed
Destroyed my aberration
Mortal seeds in divine
Gave grief into life's form
And so curved the spine
Obeisance made before him
Blessed in life but truly cursed by death
Bitter choice befalls you
Glory, lord of men, asks but pain
Master's stone was weaved
Compelled before the throne
Then war came, a semblance of her
Lands unite and he prospers
Grand signs assail me
Temptation yields assent
As irons carve the sand
A ruse brings fate upon him
Anguished price for laurels
Veins burnt by hatred,
In premonitions menis consumed me
Unsanctified, I cared nothing for their ways
Yet a father's plea dragged mercy from me
Now, demi-god, echo in eternity
A toxic toll pierces the flaw
On reflection, there was never any choice",Metal

the weight of the heart you will behold
schripture keeping come from thoth

Heart is placed on a scale
feather on the other side
For every test that is passed
the feather shows its decline
Over the pale blue skies
or one step closer to demise
which is your destiny
The spirit will surely see
Forty two crimes
are passed before your life
He who reaches the other land
shall exist like a god until the end
weighing of the heart,
will you see the light
weighing of the heart,
will your soul be ripped apart

Over the pail blue skies
or one step closer to demise
which is your destiny
The spirit shal surely see
Beyond you do not go this time
failed the worst of the crimes
The entity does not proceed
To the mansions of eternity
As the shadow of death falls
on your path is the gods halls
Ammit will devour and slaughter
Osirus start the next trial
weighing of the heart,
will you see the light
weighing of the heart,
will your soul be ripped apart

"My name should be trouble
My name should be woe
For trouble and heartache is all that I know
Yeah, lonely lonely blue boy is my name
My life has been empty
My heart has been torn
It must have been raining the night I was born
Yeah, lonely, lonely blue boy is my name
Well, I'm so
I'm so afraid of tomorrow
And so tired, so tired of today
They say that love is the answer
But love never came my way

"Kay rami nang nagbago sa buhay
Mula nang tayo'y nagmahalan
Puso ko'y natutong tumibok sa isang kumpas
Hanggang isang pintig na lamang
Ang marinig mula sa ating dibdib
Ngunit paraiso na ating narating
Ngayo'y naglalaho tulad ng isang bituin
Habang ikaw ay naririto sa dibdib
Ipaglalaban ko ating pag-ibig
Sa harap ng paghihirap at pasakit
Ako'y handang magtiis
Hangga't 'di kita lubusang maintindihan
Aaminin ko ang pagkukulang

"Then I looked into her young eyes
From eighty years she looks back
Into my young eyes
And she is gone
To where?
Where has her soul gone?
Body found yes
But her very mark her sign
Lost it seems to me now
Though I feel that she is here still
All around me windsouled
To love is always to live somehow
As long as our eyes are still this colourdull glass
I will not know her still
This parched scorched earth
Endless wheel of suffering
Great ocean of pain
Bloodbucket of grief
Roaring mouthgaped O
Of disappointment and despair
Will not then exist
And we shall smile
We shall smile as big
As the big crescent moon
Which lies on its arched back and dreams
Of cats and stars and snow
And as before we saw smiley shining stars
And disreaching them
Our arms would wave like a desperate windmill
Hoping hoping to welcome them home
Now we shall touch them close to our hearts
And what we are
And what we may be
Maybe
Why I have failed
And all I could have been
And am not
And all I had hoped for
And were not
And everything I hoped
And hoped and hoped and hoped for
I prayed in the morning
And I prayed in the evening
And I got not
From the rotgut god
When all the world starts to shiver
And shimmer and shake all around me
And all the worldlight was piecemeal
And peaceless
This is the atomic pain of the worlds
The molecular tears
The final crystalline structure of misery
That winds its way around the wooden snakejawed growing spine
Of the worlds
Listen: I was taken
To be betrayed whenever is hate
To be betrayed wherever is hate
As the body is abused by man
There in the Patrapassion edge of the world
The hanging god is invaded
In heart and soul
I suffer you all suffer
You suffer all I suffer
Suffer suffer suffer suffer
The tearblowing world creaks around
And we are broken 
Loss
Light and darkness
Light and darkness
It seems to the little blue and green world
That they do not know each other
But they must finally

Forgiven
And suffering before
We suffer too
Here's sixpence
Here's sixpence
Go and play and play
In the flaky pale fields that still are somehow this land
And spend oh spend your life away
Spend your spend your night away
And waste and waste your life away
Under the brightstarlight
Under your yewboned archlight body
you are dead
Under this shitstained sky
you are dead
Under the loveless muddy almoststars
You are dead
Under the sleeping closed eyes of the Bhagavan
You are dead
Under the road and the track and the path
Along the green grass slipping way
Along the snaking way
you are deady deady
Deady deady
Deady deady

""The moon is bright and my fiddles tuned for playing""
Tell me that the night is long
Tell me that the moon is glowing

Fill the glasses one more time
And never heed the empty bottle
Turn the water into wine
And turn the party up full throttle
Don't go out into the cold
Where the wind and rain are blowing
For the fire is flaming gold
And in here the music's flowing

Tell me that the night is long
Tell me that the moon is gleaming
Fill my glass, I'll sing a song
And we'll keep the music streaming
Until all the songs are sung

"I tell you of a girl, her husband was a soldier
Gone to war in some strange country far away
No word had come to her but the rumors of great battles fought
And dying in their thousands and the world full of fear
As the day would turn to evening she would light a pure white candle
And place it in a window bright from where it could be seen
As she placed it in the window softly without thinking
She said let this burning candle be a beacon
Let joy and innocence prevail
Let joy and innocence prevail
Believe that luck will never fail
Let joy and innocence prevail
And one night, asleep
She dreamed she saw her husband fall
In a great white cavalry charge
And waking in tears
She saw the candle burning in the window
She still had hope
And through the window
A man in the distance
But as he came closer
She saw he was a stranger
The stranger said, ""I bring a message from a General
A captain has been wounded, his life hangs by a thread
He calls out your name and he wishes you to come to him
But the journey is a hard road and you may be afraid""
And she laughed and said, ""No road could be too hard for I am fearless
A captain and a husband, I have gained this bright new day""
And she said with all her heart, she would fly to be beside him
And her love would heal his wounds, restore him to her
Let joy and innocence prevail
Let joy and innocence prevail
Believe that luck will never fail
Let joy and innocence prevail
Let joy and innocence prevail
Let joy and innocence prevail
Believe that luck will never fail
Let joy and innocence prevail

Call themselves my friends
Take my CDs

To find the nearest pay phone and
call the Repo Man

When CD Repo Man
That guy is on a roll
He'll jump through windows
To get back what the suckers stole
He looks tame, but
You know he will attack
He does his job
To get your CDs back

When your possessions are gone
And something is wrong
There is action to take
Don't call him unless you're really ticked
Because there is no escape
He wears a suit, it looks like he's strapped
Don't mess with him
Or you'll get smacked
Don't steal my CDs

Because a Repo Man is always intense!

When he really got trouble like a daughter gone bad

That my love was silent that my heart was real

Send me what I'm waiting for
Pick me up an image so fine so fine

Give me what I'm waiting for
Set my heart on making you mine
In a moments anger I will freeze the frame
But my feelings for ya how they will remain
I've been looking at you you've been looking at me

All the stars are fixed up in the sky
I just want to sparkle for a moment
Before I just fizzle out and die
I'm happy because I'm stupid
Scared of spiders, scared of flying
If I wasn't so happy
I wouldn't be so scared of dying
So just be gentle with me

And I'll be gentle with you
I'm not as brave as I thought
'Cause my heart gets broken so easily
So just be gentle, be gentle with me
Wide awake, waiting like a target
Listening for things I cannot see
Insects flutter up against my window
I don't like the way they look at me
I guess I've always needed
To be needed by someone
It's a comforting feeling
Being under someone's thumb
So just be gentle with me

And I'll be gentle with you
I never mean to be mean
'Cause I want to pick peaches off of a cherry tree
Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, be gentle with me
So just be gentle with me
Trouble is sometimes
And I'll be gentle with you

Because I'm mental, be gentle, be gentle

Trying to make it
It's been a long road
Sic-Wid-It Records

Oh! 
Y'all feel that? 
It's real out here 40 

I'm out here in the slums where thugs be using, ghetto tactics
Like, chopping up candy canes
Sitting on top of a dried up JC Penney day mattress
Whatever it takes to survive, see that's what I supply
Like slipping and sliding in the grocery store
And settling out of court
Soft white coke a black turn into hard solidses
Thirty-eight snub nosed pistol grip lay ninjas on they
The saga continues, the struggle's just beginning
And it's hard to look up to snotty folks, cause THEY be sinning
'Pac gone, Biggie gone, Seagram gone and we also lost Eazy-E
One of the first gangster rappers of all time
To the most vicious and deadliest disease in history since cancer
To Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, tombstone
From the graveyard shift, RBL's Mister see
One love, to Rapping Ron and Plan B
Victims of the trigger
Po' out a little liquor

It's not the same, this world is crazy
We out here going through it all
Everything must change, it's getting shady
Got our backs against the wall

I shed tears for pain 40, some for anger
Seen bloodshed by crooked cops, and gang bangers
Feel my pain only time'll change it
And fast money, cars, and bitches got me trapped in this game
And my lil' homies balling, picture me falling
And momma in the funeral screaming and crawling
Is there a heaven or hell?
To ghetto kids in the anky only time will tell
And jealousy, and envy, come with money
While crooked, politicians, run the country
And it's a, damn shame to see my, weeples vanish
Now they teach us ebonics, what about English and spanish
I couldn't, live my life behind bars and gates
While the government play a game called process to eliminate


Case #246, shooting in an inhabited area
They was steady complaining about the dope selling
But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted
They ain't never been subpoenaed to court, or arrested
Shackled like an animal for pushing rocks
Dang near choked to death by motorcycle cops
Pepper sprayed and laughed at like that shit was funny
Pregnant breezy threw down on her tummy
Do you ever think I'll ever be able to get
A chance to repent and ask the lord for forgiveness
Before he close the casket, will my son end up growing up
Without a father will he end up being a bastard?
A bastard, that's a good question
I don't know, I don't know

Sunday morning I was so sharp, all did up

Seven grams of cocaine, three grams of dope

Shelters for the vultures hardly keeping daylight out
Marble stained with rust, faded paintings on the walls
Beaten towers crumble, haunted only by the wind

No angels left to hold me

Picking up the given challenge of the fallen gargoyle angels
Headed on collision course with martyrs tied as fenders
Driving like a mad dog going faster than a bullet
Pulled by gravitation from a million tons of stone
Human insects lived here crawling through the underground
Beehive built in stainless, a cathedral for the slaves
Spineless cowards guided by ideals they couldn't grasp
Giving up their freedom in the hope of being chosen
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man
In the twilight grows the shadow's hollow hands that tries to catch me

Like the ancient temples their monuments survived them
Speeding through the ruins I left their bridges burning

Will go right on through, right on through me

All the things that hurt your soul
No one would ever know
They'd never know
Life so preciously
Just don't seem to be
As free as they claim freedom to be
Things are going fast
To have found that all is in the past
To have to take what you can get
Sure can make a heart upset
Inconspicuous
I must behave myself
For somebody else
Who may have a little fame, fortune and wealth

"When they 1st met, he swept her off her feet
with a boyish smile, acting so sweet
They talked alot-got along really well
little did she know-she was entering his hell
Her love grew stronger with every day
She'd always wish he'd never change in any way
as time passed on he started to change
The innocence left him-he was becoming so strange

Her love is innocence
he took her by surprise
her love is innocence
in her weakness he prides
her love is innocence
love will always be blind
her love is innocence
trying to break from his bind

things were going great
he was liked by her friends
he made her happy
she never wanted it to end
the days went by
and the closer they got
in her open heart
she gave him a special spot
perfect in others eyes
if they'd only known more
like what went on behind his closed doors
he hid it well by trying to act so cute
scared for herself she had to remain mute
with his short temper he was always ready to snap
with no conscience he'd set up his trap
she always kept quiet-scared of what he might do
he made her sick, left her black and blue

she tried to leave but she was scared of his threats
he was relentless and he never had any regrets
he'd push her around and then laugh in her face
held her at knifpoint to show her his place
wheres that sweet boy
she had met years before?
she didn't understand as he knocked her to the floor
she picked herself up and left him behind
all he has left
is his warped and twisted mind

Was at ease.

So long for your kiss

And you're sleeping in your harness
And the wind going wild
In the trees,
And it ain't exactly prison
But you'll never be forgiven
For whatever you've done
With the keys.

It's dark now and it's snowing
O my love I must be going,
The river has started to freeze.
And I'm sick of pretending
I'm broken from bending
I've lived too long on my knees.
Then she dances so graceful
And your heart's hard and hateful
And she's naked
But that's just a tease.
And you turn in disgust
From your hatred and from your love
And comes to you
Light as the breeze.
O baby I waited
There's blood on every bracelet
You can see it, you can taste it,
And it's please baby
Please baby please.
And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim
But don't forget there's still a woman
Beneath this
Resplendent chemise.

Fail miserably in front of you

And I'm a circle for your love
The self sin and struggle crowd the sidewalk
Parading pose with phones and paper cups
You walk like truth to a world of fiction

It's all inside my mind
I look all over, all over to find
It don't keep me satisfied, yeah

And of course Prince Charming is the theme

It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.
Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.
He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.",R&B

Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
For nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye

"Verse 1:
Off...Off...Off...Off...Off in the club with a model poppin bottles
Haters don't like it getting mad cause' I'm rockin full throttle
That's my motto, every chick in the club wanna get me home...tonight
But as I look into the crowd all I see is you
Perfect smile, Perfect figure you're my dream come true

Girl I'm so gone I can't help but keep thinking about you
No matter what it takes I can't leave this club without you
You're just the type of girl I've been searching for my whole life
I ain't gotta look no more

In you...In you...In you...In you whoahhhhhh
Verse 2:
I'ma be your soldier fighting for your love tonight
I'm ready to go to war
The thing about this feels right
Girl tonight is our night
Just you and me out on this dance floor
It don't matter what it takes all I want is you...you
I think it's time girl you fly, can I fly with you

Girl I'm so gone I can't help but keep thinking about you
No matter what it takes I can't leave this club without you
You're just the type of girl I've been searching for my whole life

In you...In you...In you...In you
Verse 3:
Ain't nobody else in this club
You deserve to leave with me
Cause them other chicks don't matter
Cause girl you're all I see
Tell me what you want and I'll be what you need
The heavens sent you made just for me

Girl I'm so gone I can't help but keep thinking about you

"This is the day you disappeared
Your hand was steady and I know that your mind was clear
You left a note up on the shelf
Saying ""I would rather be anyone but myself""
You took a simple ride across the Great Divide
You left the television on in you room
Your friends were sad although they said ""I told you so""
You never really did fit into your skin
The small annoying things you do
All seemed so cute and entertaining when they were new
This kind of honeymoon can't last
I think you knew you wore your welcome out much too fast
I was surprised to see you played the lottery
Your winning ticket you won't need anymore
You were in such a rush you never stopped to check
You jacket pocket on your way out the door",Rock

Take my heart and steal away

"I like salsa with my pancakes, baby
I like to vacuum when I'm in the nude
I'll watch the weather channel for no reason
I like it, baby, just like I like you
Sometimes the love you get is free from logic
Sometimes it happens when it least expect it
Sometimes I wonder why the world's gone crazy
But I like never knowing what comes next
Cause I found you
Without out even trying
Or lifting a finger
And then you were here

Such a strange thing
We think we are in control
We always know
Until we don't
Funny how the world can spin so fast
And we don't crash
We just get dizzy
If I could, Maybe I'd build a rocket
So you and I could make love on the moon
And get perspective on a world gone crazy
Get understanding about you and me
I used to pully my hair out and worry baby,
That I would die before I found true love
But then the moment that my heart stopped searching
A spirit brought you here and the universe
Called my bluff
The best things happen
When you don't try
Or wish on an eyelash
Just open your heart
To a strange thing

Fasten your seat belt, it's always a bumpy ride
Check out the scenery
Don't sweat the details
Don't choke on your pride
Don't fight the changing tide
Your fears in your mind
We're all just flying blind

"CYNIC COSMOS LYRICS
I long to live with some celestial beings
to adore in silence blissful friends
gliding into constellations of their smiles
melting into shining eyes
chant away
the cosmos grace
born inside the lotus gold
to be at the feet of celestial artists
close to the brush of their cosmic strokes
churning whispers into melodies of psalm
in timeless rhythms, blessed tones
chant away
the cosmos grace
born inside the lotus gold
I can live this revelation
with magnified devotion
magnified devotion

Free my mind from all obstacles of delusion
And lead me safely to thy shores of fulfillment
Awaken within me increasing strength, positive
thinking, courage, faith
And above all fill my heart
With thine unconditional love
With thine unconditional joy""

near to touch those divine companions

"It's over, our love affair,
Too late now I find I care
Her sweet love, never more I'll share
She's gone, I'm alone,
I was wrong, should have known
Took her home after our last date
I searched for a simple way
To tell her what I had to say
I kissed her then I turned away
Set her free, foolishly, destiny, misery
Tragedy, on our last date
Took my ring from her trembling finger
Brushed the tears from my baby's eyes
Walked away, didn't know
That I'd soon miss her so
I guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldn't see
How much she really meant to me
And that soon she would always be
On my mind, in my heart,
I was blind from the start
Lost her love on our last date",Rock

No, there's nothing wrong
You know me

Low outside our window?
And it's hard to sleep with
All of those feelings around
Oh, if I had wings tonight
You could imagine things
I never wanted you more
Than I want you right now
Looking out at the city
It sparkles and it shines
But it holds no fascination
Compared to you
Save me some long nights
And your wildest dreams
And all of your love
And some of that moon
Life may take me down
A winding road
But nothing in this world
Can change my love

Why you must amazes me

Golden,
Where are you?
Sold on gold dust
I shuttled all around America
From New York to Los Angeles
Nervous breakdown later, there we were
From Liberty to redwood trees
A friend of mine, she hitched from east to west
In time to hear my final song
It seems to me she tried her very best
She is a good companion

He stores away the moments of her smiles
As if they were rare butterflies
Stalks his prey for miles and miles and miles
Then barters for the merchandise
When Life it drags the likes of me around
Just when we need some time alone
You have a simple mansion underground
Without address or telephone

Wait'll niggaz hear that tame and fatal got down and made it straight
From uptown with six sacks and this track that's in the background
Stop stressin from the chest up, we messed up
Off that best stuff that fits up in yo' dutch
Situation like this, you get blown to bits
Fuckin with this brick lyricist, more complex than the pyramids
Here it is, strictly biz like small print
In between them bong hits, we drop the strong shit
Chickenheads say, ""who him? "" with fucked up timb's
Knotty fro and baggy denims, spendin up the benjamins
In city tenaments, the boom skwadron odd man
Don't give a fuck like rodman 
With no rings like patrick ewing 
Still I play hard regardless
Acquitted from the charges throwin darts up at the heartless
Aimin for your brain, tame one, one of the darkest
Brown like the chocolate, poppin your metropolis
Chorus: fatal hussein
Around my way, all they do is shoot dice all day
Escapin secret indictments, gettin nice all day
Don't let em fold ya, outlawz, the getto star soldiers
Give this letter to the president, before this shit is over


When hussein aim, puttin they brains on walls like tame name
Blastin these motherfuckers cause they just can't maintain
Y'all plain jane's gel in the ? well's? county of sing-sing
Me and young noble, got em strung hold em for hostage
Lyrics verbally toxic, spit like doubled edged optics
My shit is milk, wearin silk shirts with chocolates
Y'all broke and can't cop shit, I get, physically fit
On some evil eye ready to die shit
This thug shit, niggaz get beat down and shot up
I saw this one nigga, get stolen on and your soul got up
Stolen car, roll past the bar, toured a lot of city
Gave him an eighth and he cooked his whole product
It's a shame how you cowards change the game for narcotic
You don't get it, don't got it, the love of money get exotic
If you old you get shot at, and can't walk the streets
Without gettin your lil' money hungry soft ass spot
Chorus

We adapt to the system like ? eddie bap? on mission
Get an ounce of izm, two six-packs, and kid listen
Just a dip on the task, my little niggaz on the ave
Do a bid and laugh, come home and cop a half
Hit me with twenty hundred, what you got was fronted
Now run it, I got this fuckin drug spot where I want it
So don't be dissin new, when you ain't got shit to do
Five thousand dollars, charge free, right out municipal

Niggaz get played off to the left like they was southpaws
Toss you to the outlawz, then let them shoot it out
For what you clock for -- got more than you expected
When I inject correct shit, it gets hectic
Fuckin comin up with that next shit, thug niggaz and bugged niggaz

We burn mics on turnpikes, we swervin through the lanes
We throw chains at bitches, it's back to new jeru to get these riches

It all belongs to her
Now she's gone into nothingness
There she waits
Still I can hear her singing in the room
In the room I know she's gone
I've thought ""She'll never fail,
All magic will be gone
The day she'll melt away""
This is the end of all the miracles
Still I hear her singing in the dark
Truth has changed, her voice it stays the same
Farewell to you yellow brick road
Still I hear her singing in the dark
While time goes on her voice will fade away
""They are all, they're everything, they are mine
Silver shoes you're mine, you are mine,
You are mine""
Hate will live on
This is the end of all the miracles
Farewell to you yellow brick road

I was like peace in a groove
On a sunday afternoon
You were there so was i
In the park 4th of july
I was chillin' with my kool-aid
When miss chilli came to relay
That you had a thang for me
Finest thang you'd ever seen
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am
Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby bay-ooo-baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gone be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my kool-aid
Did not want to participate
In no silly conversations
Had no time for new relationships
I must admit to you
When I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am

Oh why do I feel the way I do
When all I can think about is you
Diggin' diggin' diggin' on you
What was it in a line
That made me fall for you

The pines and the willows know soon we will part.
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken,
And a love that will always remain in my heart.
My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter,
The magic of moving as one,
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done.
Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?
Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping
Over the lake the stars shine.

And so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out, I faced it all
And I stood tall and did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes it was my way",R&B

I wanted back my life and my freedom
You said you won't stand in my way
You let me go, but now I know
That space just means I'm lonely with this void inside
And time now moves so slowly since you said goodbye
Girl, I've tried to go on with my life
But how can I live when we've died

And I thought the grass on the other side would be greener than you and I
But now I'm lost in black and white
I know I can't save this, but I need to say this
Without you, life just isn't life at all

I heard you packed my things, gave them all away
Threw out our memories, tried to forget me
Wish I could fix your broken heart
But I'm afraid it's too late
'Cause now I only see you when you're in my dreams
And I don't wanna wake up 'cause it means you'll leave

That's why I put my life in every song I kill, sing it girl
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
They was wrong, this the song of a champion
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
Let me see your hands up if you a champion
I had a job too, niggas so what?
You haters make me laugh, how you hatin' so much?
Go head and do the math, watch the numbers add up
Picture me and Khaled rollin' to the Grammys, messed up
Keep running to The Runners when it's time to make a

Throwing up a peace sign to all my hustlas on the strip
Top down in the Chevy yeah, you know I keep it pimpin'

Know that I'm on the grind, niggas know that ain't slippin'
My faith is on the line so you know I ain't slippin'
You trippin' and that's why
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
They was wrong, this the song of a champion
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
Let me see your hands up if you a champion
Ladies put your hands up high
Came too far now to give up
We gotta keep reaching for the sky
It don't even matter say what you want
Fellas put your hands up in the sky
Nothing you could say that'll make me stop
We gotta keep reaching for the sky
I'ma keep going till I reach the top and that's why
Definitely livin' life, I gravitated to the light
I sacrificed a decade, now it's times every night
Let them suckas' spectate 'cause shorty I expect that
We still touching big weight and surely I invest that
Break it down the best way 'cause I know how to stretch that
Haters talking sideways and I could never stress that
Ready for the war though, I would never compromise
Mammy call me Gordo, you shine like summer time

They was wrong, this the song of a champion
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

In the battle of light with dark earth

Loves, gives birth, kills - it's powerful !
She raises beautiful monuments by the Baltic
Lives when I sleep and lives in me...
At night raises over dreaming forests
She awakes Gods and Goddesses, unsilently
The night cock she is, whispers wolfish spells
The chants of bard she knows and hums them
Goblins of oaks and denizes of darkness
Bathed in the wine of a delightfull night...
And lives there, but dies at dawn ...
Dies in me with barbarous voice.

"The lightning express from the depot so grand
Had started out on its way
All of the passengers that were on board
Seemed to be happy and gay
But one little boy who sat by himself
Was reading a letter he had
You could plainly tell by the look on his face
That the contents of it made him sad
The stern old conductor then started his round
Taking tickets from everyone there
And finally reaching the side of the boy
He gruffly demanded his fare
""I have no ticket"" the boy then replied
""But I'll pay you back someday""
""Then I'll put you off at the next stop we make""
But he stopped when he heard the boy say
""Please Mr. Conductor
Don't put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away""
A girl sitting near was heard to exclaim
""If you put him off, it's a shame""
Taking his hand, a collection she made
The boy's way was paid on the train
""I'm obliged to you miss for your kindness to me""
""You're welcome,"" she said, never fear
Each time the conductor would pass through the car
The boy's words would ring in his ear
""Please Mr. Conductor
Don't put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir

All it is, is about this hustle, whatever it takes to piece this puzzle
Why declare war on these fakers and haters eliminate us, traitors?
These are the days of our lives

Do or die

Whom die they lie in the face of our society
Try at of every attempt to quiet me
I got a nation that's down to ride with me
Here's the deal, can I get a witness?
It's deeper than survival
Who am I? My brother's keeper?
Yeah, I be clutchin' on my Bible, willing to die
The wicked is near me
Dearly departed but nobody hears me
Is we all gon' fall in misery?
It's so serious, it bring tears to me
Ears to the street, like a drum to the beat
Creepin' up my block
I'm already knowin' a nigga wanna do me
So I stay strapped

Crooked cops, they gonna harass me
Ask me the same ol' bullshit questions
Knowin' I'm a thug with bud for days
Keepin' a pistol in my possession
But a thuggish ruggish soldier like myself gon' move on
And prevail, avoid jail, collect my mill with my Bones, splittin' domes
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, don't make me hurt ya
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, all about that bloody murder

The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border
On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border
In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away
Late last night the rain was knocking at my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border
In the islands where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well

Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one

He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges

A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk

Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they are right, yes, but who's to say?

Suffered wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery

Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

The privilege has been given too much
To forgive and forget for all you've done
Now you have a label on yourself
To show what's next to come
You get so much out of all this
Pain and misfortune to all your surroundings
You never learned to stop your troubles
Prepare to suffer for what you've done
Stand alone, in a place
And no one speaks a word
Different from other days
Everything vanished, No one learned
Why are we waiting for the end?
I know its not coming
We should leave it all
Seeing what else it could bring

Add all this pain to all this sorrow
You've got what you want now
But you'll definitely pay tomorrow!

Who had a handsome, lovely daughter.
She was courted by a fair young man
Who was a servant to her father.

They swore theyd send him from the island.
The maid she knew her heart would break
Had she to part with young Matt Hyland.
Then straightway unto her love she goes,
Into his room him to awaken.
Saying, arise my love, and go away,
This very night you will be taken.

In spite of me he will transport you.
So arise, my love, and go away,
I wish to God Id gone before you.
Oh must I go, to her he said,
Oh must I go without my wages.
Without one penny allin my purse
Just like some poor, forlorn stranger
Heres fifty guineas all in bright gold
And thats far more than father owes you.
So take it now and go away,
I wish to God Id gone before you.

Just for the side of one half hour,
Not a word did either speak,
But down their cheeks the tears did shower.

And round his neck her arms entwined.

Has become properly insured

Will you still kiss me the same when you taste my victim's blood?

The desire to deconstruct all of my past failings

Reflecting their jet black auras back on you

I'll wipe the blood from my cheek and get on with my day
And all I have is hope, and all I need is time

A carpenter's death

flamboyantly he's playing his song

Refusin to be a victim, we do it and take it and then some
Tryna get out, and give back, the government givin us no slack
They double up on our taxes, send us to jail because we sell crack
But them airplanes been flyin, since Reagan was the president
Was evident, seem irrelevant, what's the relevance to your precedence
Let us live, quit willie lynchin, Layzie Bone got the heart to mention
The reason we live in attention, cause the po-po a gang of henchmen
Who resistin, quit trippin, I'm just tryin to earn a livin
Tryin to go up against the system, keepin my ass up out of prison
Listen, you younger niggaz, you got to have vision
If you see it you can read it, Jesus died for the vision
But the vision is to walk with swag, hold your head and walk in brag
Never let 'em make you mad, rep yo' set and get the cash


Emergin from the cig' butt, showin up, comin up
Barbecues by the pool, the neighbors can't believe it's you
Livin how you will, house up on the hill
Rides with big wheels, it's they worst nightmare
Gimme mines right here, dark skin, curly hair

It don't matter cause we set the trend for everything they do
Put the road to the wheel, put the fire in your meal
Took the dog from your wife, put the log in her life
Now it's all about you get it cause yo' shit real light
We the ones that keep it poppin and got the whole world vibin
You wanna get in our minds, cause we got the perfect timin
to build a whole new world, take my gold and my diamonds

Playing one night roadhouse stands
For tips in empty rooms
These boots have stood toe-to-toe
With the biggest baddest Joes
Like they had some things to prove
These boots
Yeah these boots more than once have saved my ass
Like the time they hid that grass
From those cops in Tupelo
And these boots have danced with the devil
And nearly lost that battle
To a wild-eyed Irish Rose
I've worn out more souls than I can recount
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damnedest thing I've ever seen them do
Is walkin' out on you.
These boots had to see California
And an Arizona morning where God paints the sky
And these boots had to spur that beast in Cheyenne
Thought that bull'd make me a real man
I still drag that leg sometimes
I've worn out more souls than I can recount
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damnedest thing I've ever seen them do
Is walkin' out on you.

Stomp out my foolish pride

"Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon
And the anchors have been weighed
From Miami to Nassau
She's bound across the waves
She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay
Into the open sea
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it
Now the many years she's been to sea
She's seen the better times
She gives a groan of protest
As they cast away her lines
And the grumble of her engines
And the rust along her spine
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'
But the sands run out within her heart
A tiny spark glows red
It smolders through the evening
There's laughter overhead
Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt
And the drinks are passed around
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'
Now it's midnight on the open sea
And the moon is shinin' bright
Some people join the party
And others say goodnight
There's many who are sleepin' now
It's been a busy day
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'
""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning
Let someone understand""
But her silent plea is wasted
In the playin' of the band
Everybody's dancin' on her deck
And they're havin' such a time
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle
The fire begins to glow
It leaps into the hallways
And climbs and twists and grows
And the paint she wore to keep her young
Oh Lord, how well it burns
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'
Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast
The captain stands aloft
He calls up to the boatswain, says
""Boatswain, we are lost""
For the ragged hoses in the racks
No pressure do they hold
And the people down below will soon be dyin'
All amidships, oh she's blazin' now
It's spreadin' fore and aft
The people are a-scramblin'
As the fire blocks their path
The evil smoke surrounds them
And they're fallin' in their tracks
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'
Oh then the ship, Bahama Star
Comes steamin' through the night
She sees the Castle blazin'
And 'tis a terrible sight
""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries
""We'll save you if we can""
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'
""God help the ones who sleep below
And cannot find the way
Thank God for those we rescue
Upon this awful day""
Now the heroes, they are many
But the times are growin' slim
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'
Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'
She's cryin' like a child
You can hear her if you listen
Above the roar so wild
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie
Within her molten sides?
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'
But the livin' soon were rescued
The ones who lived to tell
From the Star they watched her
As she died there in the swells
Like a toy ship on a mill pond
She burned all through the night
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'",Folk

But what I fear more, what I fear most
More than the man, the beast, or the ghost
Is that the woods are disappearing

Let alone, come up out they room!

On the computer or sex texting, man it's a different generation
Ladies, how you expect a man to make you his misses
When you can't even cook or wash the dishes
Treat your friends betta than you treat ya mama
The one who went through all the drama
Disrespectful hella rude, fucked up attitude
All you do is talk crazy and curse
But when you have yo kids you gone get it three times worse

What happen to them days they gone
When we played outside till the porch came on
What happen to them days

When my parents gave me a certain look, I got nervous
But nowadays they call the child protective service
Get on their smart phone and cheat
Run and tell they teacher that they got beat
They feeling get hurt too easy, can't wait to go to prison
They say they hearing me but they ain't listening
Accidentally spilled his drink on him in front of brah the other day
Popped him with the K cause his pride got in the way
Now I don't know what this world is coming to
But they don't wanna fight no mo they wanna shoot
Backed on each other, sneak on each other like a pooch
Spray they face on their shirts and on they back of they suits
Uhh, what happened to them 
Them days are gone

I see most snow than an igloo, more blow than a tissue
Pain hurt and sorrow, my life is a novel
The neighborhood D-Boy was my role model
Wasn't breast feed, drank out the jar not the baby bottle
 like Serato, on this Landy not Moscato
Had to walk before I crawl
It's harder to get back up man it's easy to fall
My middle finger yelling out FUCK All Y'ALL
Gotta stay prayed up, please believe it
Please covering me up with the blood of Jesus
My brothas and sistas nephews and nieces and aunties
My parents my mama and daddy uncle cousins and all my love ones
Raised in the mud, in the kingpin
Had to be a hog and good with the hems
And even if you lost and you didn't win
The hood goin respect you  cause you fought like a man

No respect, no respect, ain't no respect
No respect, no respect, living in the worst of times
No respect, no respect, ain't no respect
No respect, no respect, what are we gonna do?

To lovin' you and now it's true I got a heart full of love for you

"Now the Swan it floated on the English river
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer
and the judges watched us from the other side
I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you
preserve my room but do not shed a tear
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere""
But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever
and the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame
She said at last I was her finest lover
and if she withered I would be to blame
The judges said you missed it by a fraction
rise up and brace your troops for the attack
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action
Oh see the men of action falling back
But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still
My falsity had stung me like a hornet
The poison sank and it paralysed my will
I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers
that they had been deserted from above
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona
I'm listed with the enemies of love
And long ago she said ""I must be leaving,
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""
So daily I renew my idle duty
I touch her here and there -- I know my place
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty
and people call me traitor to my face",Rock
"We thought the baby was the answer to keep us happy in our world
Our prayers were answered with the darling baby girl
And we named her Heaven but a child's not all it takes
But I'll stay and I'll stay for Heaven's sake
You often send me roses and kiss me when you leave home
And you pick out my shirt and tie like nothing's ever wrong
But we're only fooling heaven we can't make a mistake
I won't leave you I'll see it through for Heaven's sake
Christmas trees and make believe for heaven's sake
Ginger mint and let's pretent if that's what it takes
Evening prayers and pigtails teddy bears and wishing wells
For Heaven's sake
Rollers case and skinned up knee and dirty face
I kiss her hurt until her tears are all erased
Baby dolls and your high heels lollipops before her meal
For Heaven's sake",Rock
"Enter the stairs to this last hope
Never know what's hiding behind
Thought the flames and tortured corpses
Were illusions
But it's a mirror where you topple to the master
Ceremonies which crushed the altar
A priest in a shattered pulpit
Your simplicity for your feebleness
Will be punished for eternity
Take comfort... you're not the only one

Incarcerated in a building grizzled machinations
Never more a shelter... your god is distorted

from my mama's lips between my mama's hips.
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands.
It's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on.
Life is surrounded with so many insecurities.
Back stabbin' is like breathing when in poverty.
I try to make my sanity with the insane.
God is secondary to most when they scrape for money.
But then again, money can cause even more death,
when an African turns nigga step'n fetch'n all.
I dare say when price is right you can buy us all.
Well, not me, cuz I don't truly give a damn about you.
I'll move in poverty, in wealth, but I'll surely move!
Ain't syncopated with your beat or your wack grooves.
My break beat is to break away from yo thang.
All these things you put on me makes this brother sing.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I struggle. That's why I tell you:
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
Mind and soul is even more important than body.
Well, you can put my body in all exotic spaces.
Meanwhile my mind, it so remotely dwells
within that fine spot between all f---ed up and hell.
And so I move on with confidence of harmony
and do my thing to resist this white society
'cause if you don't resist and I mean consciously,
you fool your subconscious into accepting it.
I ain't accepting it. I keep my focus. I keep my focus.
I ain't accepting it. Give me a face pencil to draw a smile on me
and say my prayer to give my earthlybody inner peace.
And say my prayer to give my earthly body inner, inner peace
until that day upon which my soul's released.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I struggle. That's why I tell you:
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
Need some time. Need some time.

you know it's gotta be real.
Thrusted in a world that I don't know
from my mama's lips between my mama's hips.
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands.
It's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on.
And so I gotta be ready to relinquish,
gotta be ready to relinquish my breath of life for
I need some time to ease my mind.
I struggle. That's why I tell you:
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.

"Mother Earth gave the people
All they ever needed, wanted.
They got a paradise to live in
Eden thrived and prospered.
Life was simple, nature valued,
Earth was giving, the people willing.
Nothing was missing from human
generous was Mother Earth.
In the weak mind of Men jealousy, gluttony took over
And all that they wanted was to own more.
Eden was violated-the vicious, corrupted city
Was swallowed up by the sea and disappeared!
Mother Earth she looked at Eden,
The exploited land, vicious Men.
Took no pity for the city,
Enforced a demise to the land!
She roused the seas to rush to shores,
Swallow all in Eden's doors.

And the biplanes on your wall
You were always Amy Johnson
From the time that you were small
No schoolroom kept you grounded
While your thoughts could get away
You were taking off in Tiger Moths
Your wings against the brush-strokes of the day
Are you there
On the tarmac with the winter in your hair
By the empty hangar doors you stop and stare
Leave the oil-drums behind you, they won't care
Oh, are you there
Oh, you wrapped me up in a leather coat
And you took me for a ride
We were drifting with the tail-wind
When the runway came in sight
The clouds came up to gather us
And the cockpit turned to white
When I looked the sky was empty
I suppose you never saw the landing-lights
Are you there
In your jacket with the grease-stain and the tear
Caught up in the slipstream of dare
The compass roads will guide you anywhere
Oh, are you there
The sun comes up on Icarus as the night-birds sail away
And lights the maps and diagrams
That Leonardo makes
You can see Faith, Hope and Charity
As they bank above the fields
You can join the flying circus
You can touch the morning air against your wheels
Are you there
Do you have a thought for me that you can share
Oh I never thought you'd take me unawares
Just call me if you ever need repairs
Oh, are you there",Rock

Make me marvel at the way the years went by
Here we are, how'd we ever get this far?
I wonder how, and I wonder why
Then I recall what these boys often saw
When we would stop to look at mom and daddy's door
They'd bow their heads while they knelt beside their bed
And we could hear them lift our names before the Lord
Mama prayed and Jesus stood beside us
Daddy prayed and the devil had to run
God looked down, and his angels guarded through the harder days
'Cause mama prayed and daddy prayed
Prayers went on but it never came down
Prayers went on but it never came down
Prayers went on but it never came down
Now the boys are grown, raising boys of their own
In a world a little darker than before

These hours moving slowly
And my phone it don't fulfill me, oh no
Looking out these small ass windows
Another day, another city
Only angels here in the night time
Ain't nobody`s with me

Staring blank up wiht the ceiling lights
Fans is my family, I love 'em so much
I'd be nowhere without em or can be
Thought of a someone who has the ability to get this money
And fame and then still be complaining

Is someone to kiss me all up on my forehead

"Welcome to Theatre of Absurd
When the world and reason are the audience
And actor illusion and experience only
Here gleams shiny mandala
In the chamber of creation and annihilation
And Lingam links with Yoni wisdom stone make
There is neither space nor time

Everything will sink and tear down phantom of mourning
Picture of universe in this simple formula -

That life is delight
That death is also life",Metal

Or hitch a ride on a freeway
Meet an old familiar face in a new place.

Aodhagan went hunting for food and money
Through the streets of Walthamstow
But the dim Sunday passed with nary a catch
And the dogs came home alone
Eat me now

 Attacking the ones who are weakest of all
On their dim walk to work with their eyes slit so small
For the dawn and the path and their shekels of mine
Fortune won't smile, I must be brutal or die
Now I live by the railway with the rest of the coven
In a hovel vibrating lit by tandoori ovens
Where we keep the ransomees
We get raided on Fridays, we get drunk when they leave us
We discuss ways to die, ways we could have gone wrong
We don't mention the now
We can see no way out
We draw skulls on the walls
We draw blood from our balls
We play catch with the rats
 the silence won't crack though we heave and we hack
Look what I stole! Look what I stole for us, darling!
Look what I stole! Look what I stole for us, darling!
Maybe we're dead, I forgot
They're hunting us, so maybe not
Oh, let us mention her torso: heat, electrical chaos
If it burst she would die, oh, oh, oh
Wasn't it kind of her to let me in?
Will it get fat when it's older
Get all riddled with cancer
While she stays the same person who is fucking me now?
See the view from above of the sofa of love
With the roof cut away, cars and people out there
And the stains spreading out and out, blood running cold
Look what I stole! Look what I stole for us, darling!
Look what I stole! Look what I stole for us, darling!
We used to be human beings, not anymore!

So you, my wife, can know her, too!",Rock

Send a shiver down my spine

Open up your eyes so you don't miss it
We can stand on top of what we're building
Oh to see right where we are heading
But in the shadows we'll see nothing
I'm a strong believer
In you, my love, forever
I'll open up the windows and let the light in
We'll break out of the darkness, and out of our skin
We'll rest in what we don't know
And speak of what we hope
Oh, my love, why are you still running
Away from what you've always wanted?
We can make our home just like Eden
And spend our days living like we're children
Let's fight what love's already won
I'm a strong believer
In you, my love, forever
I'll open up the windows and let the light in
We'll break out of the darkness, and out of our skin
We'll rest in what we don't know
And speak of what we hope
Here's to holding nothing back
And to finally having what I've always lacked
I'm a strong believer
In you, my love, forever
I'll open up the windows and let the light in
We'll break out of the darkness, and out of our skin
We'll rest in what we don't know

"Hunt like a wolf, run like a river
Put your hand on the chest
Of a heart that is beating
You lie in debt to a lover beholden
Trained on the thought of a singular union
Drive a hole through the mountain
Drive the car from the East
To the Western ocean
Back to a time when a promise
Was more easily broken
These were the seeds of the terrible winter
Your mother was old
When she said to you
It's not just how you see it
But it's how you're gonna see it through
I know you want to give it up
But who you gonna give it to?
Guilty like the sun
Out of the womb, into the ether
Feel the rain on your head
And the tundra beneath ya
A sudden blow and nobody
With a body can reach ya
A dog needs a bone, and that ought to teach ya
Your mother was old
When she said to you
It's not just how you see it
But it's how you're gonna see it through
I know you want to give it up
But who you gonna give it to?
When you love that's incomplete
It's twice as bitter and half as sweet
Guilty like the sun
Guilty like the sun
The rattle in your bones
The salt in your tears
That bating of your breath
The ring in your ears
And it's clear
You're getting closer
To your fears
Hunt like a wolf, run like a river
Put your hand on the chest
Of a heart that is beating
You lie in debt to a lover beholden
These were the seeds of the terrible winter",Indie
"Chaos uprising
Unleashing hell
Human waste
The will of the few
Will dominate the many
Human flesh
Scattered remains
From the sky above
A lethal force of mass destruction
Is casted upon the flesh
That lie below
Devastation unleashed
Fuel to the internal fire
A will of stronghold
And unquestionable belief
Life means nothing
Only the religious belief
Into oblivion
With the deceased
Another martyr screams
Faith in the unseen
Dying for their moral stupidity
The gods are preparing a human feast
The end complete
Peace retrieved
Law forces upon the free
Extreme measure
For the extreme at heart
The flesh always summons pain
From the sky above
A lethal force of mass destruction
Is casted upon the flesh
Unleashing hell below",Metal
"Found myself today, I took my cross up and walked away
With amazing grace and opened eyes
Even though I'm born to lose my way
Tomorrow comes on a hurricane
When the weight of the world's been on your mind
In the morrow, I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long
Save your sorrow for your song
Don't we always find a way to carry on
No ones sees it coming
And no one walks when they should've been running
And nothing hurts like knowing you've tried
And we can see how years can slip away
In the cold dark nights and the long hard days
But nothing aches quite like goodbye
In the morrow, I'll be gone
I gave it everything I had for so long

O grieving heart when will you finally cease to beat and stop the stream that is flowing through my veins
Disilusioned are my dreams
My will to leave has expired
Rotten are my last hopes
Please death come and make it end
Sorrow has replaced my joy
So ephemeral in my life
Abandonned is my spirit
Once so strong in my dreams
And loneliness is killing me
Nothing is worth for evermore
Now nothingness dwells in my mind
Letting me rule the ruins of my life
Buried now are my last hopes

We were tunin' up to play a gig just another one night stand
I looked over my guitar and there stood an old man
His cowboy clothes were frayed and worn and his boots were far from new
He said I'd like to sit in with your band I'm a country singer too
Well we just had a big laugh
And when I looked back at the old man there was a tear in his eye
I told the band to cool it I didn't want to see him cry
He reached down and he took my guitar with a determined look on his face
But as he started to play and sing a look of sadness took its place
He said I've sang my songs from Maine to California
Seen the world through the window of a car
I never saved a dime back when I made it I always thought someday I'd be a star
But now my voice is cracked and no one wants me my wife gave upon me years ago
It's been so long my kids don't even know me pickin' and singin' is the only life I know
And then he said

I wonder if God likes country music will there be a place up there to sing my songs
Will he make my fingers nimble like they used to be
So I can play the chords and sing along

I just stood there none of us really knew what to say
He took my guitar and he put it down ever so gently
And then as he started to turn and leave
The band stood up and applauded and I can still hear his words today he said

I wonder if God likes country music...",Country

Yeah
We're streamin' live online for the world to see
It ain't me young G, your girl all on me
She chose me when she seen your boy buy out the bar
Told her, ""Drink till you drop, lil' superstar""
Better chill, be cool, homie, grab a drink

We at The Palms where it ain't no drama
Hugh Hef' thugged out wearin' Layzie pajamas

Smashin' on the diesel, head-rush from the indo

If you really tryin' to gamble shake 'em up and roll my way
Nobody rock the way a Bone Thug show
We get it in overtime but they already know
Break out the money then we headed for the exit

Ain't no tellin' what we 'bout to get next in

I'm on my tip-toes, steady I be floatin'
Coastin' holdin' somethin' that I'm sippin' on slow

Bartender, let me get a shot of Henny, make it double
Mix a lil' gin with it, gon' get me on the level
I see you, girl, lookin' at me, lookin' at you
Feelin' your drink and feelin' me too
It's the physical attraction, baby, what can we do?
She want a little thug passion, roughness, harassment
Drink a little Mo', while I drink a little Mo'
Let's get tipsy and forget where these feelings is finna go
To the room, that's where I'm tryin' to guide 'em to

Make our way through, top shelf and we're blowin'
Don't worry 'bout your business gettin' out there, girl
Come here, grown man, put some thug in yo' ear
You're drop-dead gorgeous, sip till we nauseous
And then we're gonna bounce, bounce, shake 'em

We hit the dance floor, dance floor, dance floor
Take it to the medic, pack liquor to where we headed
You could read it right before that they set it to end the rhetoric
The veteran, the gentleman, the warrior, the better man
And Bizzy's just a thug gettin' fucked up, get it?
Safe sex, never ever with the same sex

Yeah we at Vegas

Spend it like wild Roulette
Free drinks, hundred thousand dollar chips
Leanin' back in the whip in the night-life strip
It ain't my fault

If I can't see the teardrops fill her eyes
Wish I could be there standing by her window
When she finds the note about me being gone
I'm almost sure her coldness never changes
But still I'd like to know it if I'm wrong

If she hurts at all I'd like to know it happened

"Every day is a journal page
Every man holds a quill and ink
And there's plenty of room for writing in
All we do is believe and think
So will you compose a curse
Or will today bring the blessings
Fill the page with rhyming verse
Or some random sketchings

Teach us to count the days
Teach us to make the days count
Lead us in better ways
Somehow our souls forgot
Life means so much
Life means so much
Life means so much
Every day is a bank account
And time is our currency
So no one's rich, nobody's poor
We get twenty-four hours each
So how are you gonna spend
Will you invest or squander
Try to get ahead
Or help someone who's under

Has anybody lived who knew the value of a life
And didn't He give His own
To show the worth of yours and mine?

Make the most of the time every minute you're living",Pop

It ain't a middle finger on a t-shirt, the establishments tryin' to sell

It's the first one to stand
And the last one to fall
It's a hip shaking devil on the stage at two below,
It's doing what ya want instead of doin' what your told,
It's a preacher by the wreck tellin' folks they outta pray
'Cause the shepherd boy gets them
And lead the flock a stray
That's damn rock and roll
Give all ya got 'till there ain't nothin' left
That's damn rock and roll
Get some grass cause the party
And the party got loud
And the party turned into an angry crowd
Drowning demons feel no pain
Found a lot of ways to shame
Gone too soon just like a song
Hendrix Joplin what went wrong?
Need some answers right or wrong
Need some band to blame it on

That's damn rock and roll

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

In another town
Loadin' the stage, and the lights, and the sound
Here they come boys
They've opened doors
Count us off now Craig

Give all ya go till there ain't nothin left

Gather round 'till you've broken a sweat

Loc and come home, to homes of his own
No catching up he's in a whole 'nother zone
Still true to his roots, stay close to the chrome
Haters stay clear of him, y'all stand cheer for him
Got up out the game and overcame, let's hear it for him
Keep a new toy, so, I wonder how could
I not enjoy life, I'm re-living my childhood
Big chain monsta, whip game bonkas
Monster truck remind him of Tonka
Diamond F color, plush gold still gutter
My dealer's in the mills motherfuck' and I ain't studder
Bitter sweet, my life's a musical
From holding those to Bose gold, the Lord's beautiful
Before him I'm too shamed to show my face
But shit's so, mean I can't help but to fall from grace, motherfucker

Hot damn, but them boys want the money man

Twists and it tumbles it, flips and the fumbles
I mix it like Gumbo, I pitch it so subtle
I keep hustlers puzzled, Feds I got em wondering

'What Happened To That boy'
Six maneuver, how'd I slip into that toy
Is it the pimp, the crook, the hustling thing

Grits over the stove, head under the cupboard
In the kitchen till the fume make me feel smothered
The way it melt fiends, can't believe it's not butter
The way it melt he won't cop from none other
The he who holds O's like Krispy Kreme's oven
Or easy bake, pink divvies make
The presidential should look like strawberry shortcake, P
Imagine that Rolls Royce crashed in, me unscratched in
That millionaire boys club fashion
Uh, you niggas is clones
I hand out styles like ice cream cones, the fuck outta here
That's Pha real, my gats is real
The SL5 is lookin' like the Batmobile
Chrome lids with the matching wheels
Uh, both chains probably match ya deal
Y'all dudes is an act fa real, Pusha
Hot damn, it's a new day
Hot damn, but them boys want the money man
Neither the sun or death can be looked at
That's what an O.G told me
That was the exact moment I decided to take a pact
And if you owe me and if I decided to take it back
It wasn't nicely expect Rosco to put you back, in place
I'm what you call a destructive warpath
It'll be a shell shower in today's forecast
You a gangsta? I can't tell
You diamonds don't glimmer when the light hit it
Those jewels aren't genuine, 'cause if they was I'm nice with it
I woulda' been took that
That skinny stack in your pocket, I woulda' been shook that
In this world you gotta watch it, I'm hear to warn ya
Cats turned informant, over snow wrapped in wax
My son's home crying, don't give me no slack
Just put the motherfucking money in the bag
These words are being said as I hide behind glove and mask
Coat change not your typical crook
I'm being watched look at the camera lens in the bush

Made me realize I should apologize
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, oh then I knew
That he won my heart
So I quickly apologized
Hoping he hadn't changed his mind
But not a word did he say
So I turned to walk away

Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, oh then I knew
That he won my heart
When he asked could he walk my way
I hoped sweet things he'd say
Instead he smiled kind of nice
As he held my hand kind of tight

Making light of everything
Taking you

Go chase your dragon and I'll chase mine

Well, man, we've had one hell of a ride
Go chase your dragon and I'll chase mine

The sweeter it gets the deeper you go
I don't think we're coming back this time
Man, go chase your dragon and I'll chase mine

Put on the kettle and maybe watch a little bit of telivision

Lots of lying, Not so wise

Put my Teflon on and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas

Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok start sore
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell
The east coast crib, the size of a small hotel
The shit journalist write about me, get me confused
Have me feelin' like the heavy weight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic shit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth

Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on the tec
Fool trippin' through the set, you can get ya ass whipped
Cards missin' out my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct

Pray to Lord, forgive me for my sins
Still thuggin', cruisin', rims gleamin'

Stupid, chase the paper, they come with the shit

Entrepreneur, kinda sewer, I maneuver the best
Rowin', ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunt I'll have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle
As wise men speak, I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my niggas the world turns

No one dared to call me son

And I worked the Quebec mines
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds
I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring
In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done

With the sun in the center

And we hold our hearts before us
And we look to the distance
And raise our resistance
In the face of the forces
Gathered against us

Of a king and a kingdom
Where joy writes the songs
And the innocent sing them
I will carry the fire for you

Drink til your sleeping,

All our beds are unmade
No memory has molded
Enough to forget
And our tiny glass houses
Are not built for us yet
Takes all of the courage,
And none of the pride,
To stand in the threshold-
To sit down inside
Where we are not babies;
No we are not new
And our tiny glass houses
With the beautiful view
There's a crack in my memory
Where a funeral parade,
Rolls through the doorway
That my memory made
And funeral marches
To its funeral sounds

Are all tumbling down

Wasn't doin' nothin' but feelin' her, Now What?
Back to feelin this paper, feelin' this vapor caped crusader
Ain't the same, I came close but no cigar folks
 to the head like a drop-kick
Through the snares and all but who cares
I cut my hair instead of pullin' it out of my head, dawg I was
Something like it, now I'm
Nothin' without something sunk in my chair thinkin' bout
Lovin' someone so rare but I can't keep followin' in

"Heading into the battle
Against inferior foe.
Early morning's sea lies so silent and clear.
Let them feel a broadside
From our three decker of pride.
Let the enemy fleet shatter for the wind.
The Man of the Hour
In a challenging game,
He rose to power
By his family name.
The Man of the Hour
In the lion's den,
Wielding his power
While dooming his men.
With gun ports open
And without striking sail
He turned the ship around to chase the Danes away.
The wind made the ship heel
Causing panic aboard.
Cannons, men and cargo they all broke astray.
Lower decks were flooded,
Chaos and agony.
The morning air was filled with an aria of cries.
Crewmen jumped the rail now
Choosing ice before the fire.
Down from powder deck they saw the smoke arise.",Metal

Michael Connelly reminded me with Echo Park
Of days of hoppin' on the metro, when they let those spark
Back when I collected retro art
And since then many a dearly departed God bless they heart
God bless they hearts, harder living in Kane
Where the sun and the rain became one in the same
I took it as a lesson I was still learnin'
I'm still the will of the '84 torch burnin'
I been through heartbreaks to breakups to makeups to broke again
Not back again, my soul on the rope again
Took the jacket off and saw blood on my sleeves
When you wear your heart there, this the puddle it leaves
 It's the rebuttal of thieves
And chicks with crooks like you, so what'll it be?
She steal your heart, now she runnin' the streets
Don't need the pain, man, troublin' me
I don't need love
I don't, I don't need love
Need love, need love
I don't need love
I don't need love
I don't need love
Need love
While Kanye was chasing spaceships all over the nation
I was at the grave site, face on the pavement
Left college dropout, first flight racing
From Scranton, Pennsylvania on a prop plane praying
Heart 'bout to pop out my chest in Pittsburgh
Paranoid in first class, heard a voice, whisper 
Just touched back in LAX and my phone starts buzzin' to one thousand texts
Out the gate and runnin' like I'm motorless
I still love you explained if you don't know the rest
I would say that's when love became an issue
Anybody treated me good, that's when I diss you
A certain chick who caught the bad end of the stick
And through thin and thick I still miss you
I've trashed every girl I've had since
Warm heart, cold mind is absent, imagine
I don't need love anymore, I need pressure
Pain, my veins feelin' so electric
Blue in the skin, choosin' my sin
'Til the same sins doin' me in I don't need love
I don't need love
I don't, I don't need love
Need love, need love
I don't need love

"In ancient times
A child was chosen
He was the youngest of brothers
Chosen and anointed
Raised to be King
Him, the legend,
The slayer of goliath
Troubled times
Presented by the treasures
Of this World
He was a king
With reverence
And a King of Human measures
In spite of absence
From the giver of life
The treacherous king
The wounded soldier
He welcomed and dressed
In robes of white
Embedded in the future
We must ask our selves
How will we contribute?
Kept in his legion he remains
Fights side by side
With thousands of his kind
With all of us
This is the legend
Reminding us
How we are chosen
That we are most loved
This is the legacy
Of all who fought before
Of all our brothers

And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see all I have to offer you is me

"Woke up this morning, and opened my eyes,
Sat up in bed and to my surprise,
The world around me, it hasn't changed,
Life's still hard, and people still fake,
I sit here and ponder every mistake,
And wonder why life still ain't going the way that I want.
We all wish we could just turn things around sometimes
but then we're reminded this life that we now live is full of surprises
and words that are ad lib because you can't plan for a life this misguided
and when who I am was never decided.
So I hide it,
I'm just too scared to ignite it,
the fire inside, I'm frightened to find the pain of which I was once reminded.
And I'm scared of silence.
Cause when words leave off my brain turns on and my perspective widens.
There's some things I don't want to find,
like when I see all of my flaws and scream into the sky like
""Why God, Why?!""
Why don't I feel anymore, but at the same time I feel a hurt so deep that it cuts to my core?
Why does my heart ache and my soul hurts even more?
Why do I feel like no one cares and my friends walked out the door?
I know, that I'm not alone, but I feel so isolated.
If you care for me then why does every conversation feel so jaded?
When I write these words I feel like the pen can barely take it.
This music ain't for you, I write for me so that I can make it.
If I'm colorblind then my own worth is violent shades of red.
There's nothing more frightening than the thoughts inside my head,
And if my own greatest sacrifice is living till I'm dead.
But a thought within me tells me to fight the pain instead.
This ain't the end, no, this is the beginning,
I'm tired of being beaten down, so It's time that I start winning.
I don't know if this is God, or a power deep within me,
But all the sudden the dark inside, I feel it lifting.
For the first time in my life, I can the world so clearly.
All the pain that I feel inside, it send me reeling.
But if I never got hurt then I wouldn't know healing
And as the darkness fades away, I feel the light revere me...
This is life! This is battle!
The wounds and scars don't matter.
I wasn't made for this, my bones feel like they'll shatter.
If I take one more hit,
I'm afraid I might go down.
But at the same time I know,
That I'll get up off the ground,
And fight a battle that I can't win
But it's all about the journey.
Because we all love to win, but losing, is learning.
Today I fight for freedom,
Tomorrow for my kingdom.
You and I, I got your back,
Together we can beat em!
I'm broken and I'm bruised,
I'm hurt and I'm confused,
I don't even understand myself but what do I got to lose?
This is my calling, yeah,
This is my creed!
This is the time when I decide who I want me to be!
See you judge me, but you haven't taken a step in my shoes.
What will you do when it comes time to choose,
To Fit in, or be you? See I've always chose the latter,
And if you listen you can hear my voice through all the useless chatter.
Screaming ""Why God, Why?""
But I know the answers inside,
This is my life, my fight, I'll fight till I die!
Today I'm lost, but tomorrow I'll find it.
The strength that I need to get up and fight it!
See who I am is nothing, but who I chose to be,
And through all the pain and the agony...
I choose to be me.",Hip-Hop
"Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder
You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children
Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago
Michelangelo
Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning
And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing
And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So far below
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you laid dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk above you crying
For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago
Michelangelo
Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender
And could you hear me calling out your name
Well, I guess that I will never know

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping
And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago

They blow out the light,
And although they might be sleein'.
If they hear a sound,
I may be around,
And they know I could be creepin', 
They must be aware,
If they think I'm there, it's a very scary feelin'!
Lyin' in their beds,
Running through their heads,
Is one thought-what is he stealin'?

You know that I'll take my share
I can hear then tell
I'm a hound of hell,
As they get the smell of danger.
As I'm coming near
I can taste their fear
Of the dark and deadly stranger.
They know who I am
I don't give a damn,
I could lead ev'ry lamb to the slaughter.
So be on your guard
For my calling card,
And be sure, to lock up your daughters.
They keep us outside lookin' in,
My sister and me.
And if we're outside lookin' in,
That's the way it will be.
We're on the outside lookin' in,
But we don't really care.

"Those cries, those lies
That tell the truth
Life's intention to open
One's eyes and see it end
Those tries to attempt
To abuse and hinder minds
Accusation for a crime
That's left only justice to blame
World's weak shelter
There's no security
How can I trust
This world that's turned
My life into an irony
This worthless earth
It's infidelity and treachery
Unjustifiable way to
Prove itself a failure
Piece of mind, serenity
Turns to insanity
I've been created
Into a person I
Never thought could exist
No need for thought
It's just plain stupidity
It's so unjust
They've chosen me to die
I ask why me
False truth can't be
World's proven itself
To be nothing but misery
My conscience
Once clear and so free
Has been incarcerated
By our laws of inequality
Not care, not fair, not free

I've been threatened by my own
Ability to live
To end it all inside my head
Is nothing much to give
Immortal lies deface
My sentence document
I plead for understanding
Of this life I resent
Why...

Why... Me...
My liberty been taken away
Laws lack of respect
My trust a revolt or
Mishap meant to be
My mind corrupts for a lie
Left only to infect
My life's just a lifeless irony
To end it all
I've abandoned reality
How can I trust
This world that's turned
My life into an irony",Metal

The white one's mean returning
Tell me how this story ends
And I'll keep them fires burning
The headlights look like diamonds
The taillights burn like coals
Tell me how this story ends
Before the fires go cold
The countryside's deserted
There's no one on the farms
The suburbs all are sleeping
The earthquakes set off car alarms
All after all now we aware
All after all the time we share
There's so much fears of world,
Types of world,
Tears of world",Rock
"And meet me there, bundles of flowers
We wait through the hours of cold
Winter shall howl at the walls
Tearing down doors of time
Shelter as we go
And promise me this

Surface, far below these burn
And maybe, just maybe I'll come home
Who am I, darling to you?
Who am I?
Going to tell you stories of mine

You know I was living on doubts

I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
No traffic jam delay
See I was driving over the moon
In my big hot air balloon
Floating high into the darkness
I hope I get there soon
It's so many things to do
So many people I need to talk to
And they've all been waiting for me
Well I gotta make it through
Something special happened today
I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
No traffic jam delay
Thank my stars for every green
You have no idea what it means
To a man who's always traveling
Who's seen the things that I've seen
I don't know what's yet to come
Not sure if anything I've done
Really makes that much a difference
Well I hope it has for some
Something special happened today
I got green lights all the way

No traffic jam delay
Well I was driving over the moon
In my big hot air balloon
Floating high into the darkness

A little something for the ladies, gettin' that money by any means/ Who get with the playa-type, thuggish ruggish, from the hood with good genes/ Who kick it in high heels, plenty tank tops, camoflague fatigues or thongs clear to the vision so you can see some good things/ Stretch marks? Body smoother than marble floors in the Hamptons/ Living large in a condominium or mini mansion/ Side kick, mobile phone, free, flip like Kurt/ I'm sort of religious, superstitious, but I ain't scared to flirt/ I'm from the dirt, root and soot/ Came up on my own foot/ Used to hang with the crooks, I keep a job on my books/ I took my chance with many girls, and still I look for the woman/ I like it crazy, sexy and cool; Waterfalls, good lookin'/ I can remember back in school, being judged by Chips/ And so I hooked up with the Bone Thugs, suddenly I'm the shit/ And baby momma's drama, common dilemas and problems/ And now, I'm single, ready to mingle/ Holla, holla, holla, holla
Krayzie Bone
Now I'm tryin' to get crackin', tryin' to get into some action/ So come and take a ride with Krayzie Jackson/ Don't worry about the weed or drank, I got some/ This potent dope, let's smoke and choke/ I can put you on a lovely level where you never been/ Especially is you're stressed and depressed, yes, I got the medicine/ Sippin' a little bit of Patron, let me help you in the zone/ Put some Thug music on, something like this, something like a Bone song, and oh, don't ease your mind, unwind/ Let's slide just a little bit closer/ Just feel my vibe, and chill, get high/ Hey now  What'chu receive-a  Ecstacy if you try this a reefa/ We rollin' blowin'/ Potent potions got you open, it's got you focused/ Let's smoke some more then

Come on, come on, come on, come on/ Baby, I got the cush and a bottle patron so let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin' baby/ Let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin'
Wish Bone
When I'm gone on the Patron, have me humpin' all night long, long/ Heavy breathin' she all good, but I can't seem to reason/ So I guess I'm too high/ Turn it over, let her ride  Let her get hers two more times, I guess that's what I'd rather do/ But that liquor brings that attitude, and I might have to down a nigga/ Let off a round or two; Watch how they scatter, nigga  Thugsta's pull triggers, fool/ Ain't nothin' new, you know how we do it, do'/ It's an everyday thang, thang/ Follow nothin' but thugsta's rules/ We can drank, we can drank/ We can smoke, we can smoke/ Hit the weedman, hit the store 'fore it close/ And we gotta keep it goin' till early in the morning/ I'm a POD, so we gotta keep it goin' cause I can get higher, higher/ If you can get higher, higher, then we can stay right, right/ You know ain't no party liver

We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here, over here, over here...

They tell me I'm the talk of the town

It's nobody's business where I'm bound
As if to be alone and lonely just ain't right
On a old freight train moving down the line
I'm counting each day and every minute that your away
I've never been the stay at home kind

It's just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between us
I knew I was in trouble when we met
Dark clouds all around me I couldn't find the light
The hard time ain't hard to forget
I believe in love at first sight
I put my heart and soul on the line
And know your love is with me every day
Your picture always there on my mind

Time to take a chance


Look what I do to get her
I'd play the fool to get her
I'd cross the world to get her
I gots to, gots to get her, get her
I'd fight the rest to get her
I'd spend my last to get her

Closure is the apex;
One curve is the asp,

Yet Atu still carries the knife.

"See the streets got a feeling what I'm speaking is the truth
These other niggas lying they defying in a booth
I just picture B.I.G. and resurrecting him with juice
And hoping heaven got a ghetto for a nigga too
That's worded from the D.A.C. you need to see the truth
I was only seventeen serving after school groups
A menace to society, variety I'm proof
Some go for that eleven, yeah that's at for twenty two
I missed a lot of sunny days, they kept me in a room
That's why I copped that coupe, and chopped the motherfucking roof
So everyday I ride and I can get the love the view
I watched my money stack while I minajed in a pool
The same damn Ace that they decided was a fool
Remember in high school me couldn't ball was the news?
I just switched to different views, put them haters on snooze
I just had to renegotiate and calculate the moves
I went from show and telling nigga to the show improved
And now it's three whips, with a mansion and a pool
Louis Vuitton don sipping coconuts a cool
See the diamonds in my shades that's a rich nigga's soos
Give a fuck about a hater because I'm back in round two
Now that is what it do, now tell me who is you?
Only Benjamin alive, so you better show your use
See We the Best the mob, and the future's in the booth
Imprinted in my life and I can show you niggas proof
D.A.D. full of goons beg them niggas not to shoot
Because while them pussies creeping, they be peeping on the roof
They hating what I'm making leave you vacant by the two
And snitches die slow, them sucker niggas uninvited
And celebrate by lighters, hit the kush to get us higher

"Words by Marilyn and Alan Bergman, Music by Michel Legrand
From the 1971 film, ""Summer Of '42"" starring Jennifer O'Neill
Legrand won an Oscar for his score.
The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smoothes the restless sky
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie
The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summer time
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arms
And if you've learned your lessons well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall
And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

Got no money, nobody, to tell you the truth
When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want too much
See this song but as a warning
'Cause you're too far away to touch
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I know I'mma live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I know I'mma live without it
So come on, surprise me, I don't care who
Your step missing, time's ticking, ain't got a clue
Something I said, the way that I move
Strong passion, hot passion, too much for you
Don't complicate this, simple to me
I've got it, you want it, but it might not come free
The sun falls slowly, shadows of love
Get together, now or never, can't wait till dawn
When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want too much
See this song but as a warning
'Cause you're too far away to touch
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I know I'mma live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up, there's nothing we can do about it

"They're mislead by authority
And they're guinea pigs with
Dignity
With everlasting memories
Frozen thoughts and bloody
Dreams

Mesmerized
Souls left behind
In the killing fields
That leave you blind
In the war of conspiracy
Young men fight for humanity
When they're pawned off to the
Killing fields
Smell the stench of misery

Politicians send them off to war
Deep within the front line
The only man who's taught to
Survive
As desperation freezes time
Innocent lives are wrongly put at
Stake
Negotiate the fields of blood
Out in the cold they're taught to
Survive
Salvation runs in the blood
Off to the fields of blood
Into the fields of blood
Off to the fields of blood
Die in the fields of blood
They're mislead by authority
Soldiers die with dignity
Survivors live with memories
Broken thoughts and broken

"How to? We're here to praise your name,
Blazing sun and a bitter death
You're a guardian across the gate
Wake up there is a new dawning
Wake up the witches wait
For you remember the mirror
When she looked in you are born
And the born in the middle of Margret
There's nobody else, there's nothing 
Songs out of gnome's there's joy in the air
The hard the one dies when you were never there

Another end

Tell them where you better beware
The moment stay we sing for you
The love we blessed a child
See your bed time,?
Stay your voice in
We will be with you artipiant?
Come and move our hearts
We know there is light beyond the dark
Cry out, we cry for blood
Come cry your fear and join us
Come join us now
Join us now!
Cry out for you
Come turn the wheel
There's nothing to fear
Come turn the wheel
Come turn the page
Come turn the page

Another end

"In the eyes of a ranger,
The unsuspected stranger
Had better know the truth of wrong from right,
'cause the eyes of a ranger are upon you,
Any wrong you do he's gonna see,
When you're in Texas look behind you,
'cause that's where the rangers are gonna be

The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear

You disappear

And then I lie all by myself, I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed, if it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you

You were ready

"She's graceful to the eye
Elegant and tall
To see her walking by,
You'd think she had it all.
But I see her all the time now
A little red around the eyes now
Even so, it doesn't show
'Til I hear it in her words there
Just a little bit slurred there,
Then I know, I know,

That she's drinking again,
Started sinking again
What's she thinking of then?
Well I don't know.
But she's drinking again
Started sinking again
What's she thinking of then?
Well I don't know.
None of this is new
It all went down before
When she made it through
I thought she knew the score
But she's nothing left to hope with
And it's such a lot to cope with
Even still, I think she will,
She's trying really hard now,
But letting down her guard now
Until, until,

She dreamed of being so fine,
She dreamed of having someone by her side
And even when her dream had died,
She dreamed that she could somehow make it right
Lipstick smudging her face
Hair all over the place
They say she's a disgrace
But they don't know
If she's drinkin' a lot
And if she says that she's not
Is she able to stop?
Well I don't know

"That was my girl, if the girl displayed a smile
That always drove the fellas wild, that was my girl

If your composure sort of slips
The moment that you saw her lips, that was my girl

Unlike a deck of cards where there's four of a kind
There's only one of her and she's all mine
If the sight of her brightens your world, then it had to be nobody

It had to be no one

It just had to be none other

My girl

That was my girl
She would casually strolling by
As rare as a mink with yellow fur
You'll find one of them before you find one of her
She's the only kind like her in the world
Talkin' bout nobody

Said I'm speakin' of no one

I'm just rappin' 'bout nobody

The skies are clear, but there's lightning under my skin
It's gonna rain again, and when the rains come down
I'll be on that road again
Warriors will ride.
On their painted horses
Blessed by the wind
And the unseen forces above
They will ride on as one
They will brave the storm
Till the rains are over and done
Ride on crazy horse
Take me to the hills
Beyond the battle, where the waters are still
Where it's so quiet you can hear the children run
Far away from the sound of the gun
These are the feathers of a golded eagle
These are the feathers of an ancient people
You must, you must set my people free
Never hold me down, for the eagle must fly free

"A man came ridin' oot the west one wild and stormy day
He was quiet lean and hungry, his eyes were smoky grey
He was lean across the hurdies but his shooders they were big
The terror o' the Hielan glens, that was The Portree Kid

He drum ho, he drum hey
The teuchter that cam frae Skye

His sidekick was an orra' man and oh but he was mean
He was ca'd The Midnight Plough-Boy and he cam fae Aberdeen
He had twenty seven notches on his cromack so they say
And killed a million Indians, way up in Stornoway
Portree booted in the door, he sauntered tae the bar
He poured a shot o' crabbies, he shouted ""Slainte Mhath""
While midnight was being chatted up by a bar room girl called Pam
Who said well howdy stranger, would you buy's a babycham
Now over in the corner sat three men fae Auchtertool
They were playing games for money, in a snakes and ladders school
The fourth man was a southerner who'd come up from Macmerry
He'd been a river gambler, on the Ballachulish Ferry

Portree walked tae the table and he shouted shake me in
He shoogled on the eggcup, he gave the dice a spin
He threw seven sixes in a row and the game was nearly done
But then he landed on a snake, and finished on square one
The game was nearly over and Portree was daein fine
He'd landed on a ladder, he was up tae forty nine
He only had but one to go and the other man was beat
But the gambler couped the board off, and shouted you're a cheat
Men dived behind the rubber plants to try and save their skins
The accordionist stopped playing, his sidekick dropped the spoons
He says I think its funny, you've been up that ladder twice
And ye a'ways dunt the table, when I go to throw my dice

The gambler drew his Sgian Dubh as fast as lightning speed
Portree grabbed a screwtop, he cracked him o'er the heid
Then he gave him laldy wi' a salmon off the wall
And he finished off the business, wi' his lucky grousefoot's claw
Portree walked up tae the bar, he says I'll hae a half
And d'ye like the way I stuck it on that wee Macmerry nyaff
But the Southerner crept up behind his features wracked wi' pain
And gubbed him wi' an ashtray, made oot o' a curling stane
The fight went raging on all night till opening time next day
Wi' a break for soup and stovies aff a coronation tray
It was getting kind o' obvious, that neither man would win
When came the shout that stopped it all, there's a bus trip comin' in

They sing this song in Galashiels and up by Peterheid
Way down o'er the border, across the Rio Tweed
But what became o' Portree, Midnight and the gamblin' man,
They opened up a gift shop selling fresh air in a can

"Fallen into oblivion...
The last view inside my mind -
Silver walls ofg the castle
Risen proudly towards the sky
The rebellion failed...
Many brave ones went down-
Hung on black trees they are
Blown by the four winds
I've been waiting for years,
Growing stronger
Blazing weapons,eyes burn bright
In the dark - as a King I shall return...
Horns sing in the woods,
Hordes gather
Ancient gods of war
Ride on the sky
Old kingdom will fall
Like a moondust...
Reflecting down the walleys-
So pure, hungry for blood
The hearts of the dark ones
Thunders strike...
Dancing on the black mirrors-
The bards of war and venegeance
Came from forgotten realms
As a King I shall return...
To proclaim my victory,
Return of ancient pride,
Laws of steel...
Cold steel...",Metal

Were you reaching for attention, hoping she would notice you
Collecting bottles and thrown-away cans
Like she was returnable

Fit so well into your plans
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about each other sometimes

How you once gave up

Pining away every hour in your room
Rolling with the motion, waiting til it's opportune
Sitting there watching time fly past you

Everything you put her through

How do you figure that I let you drag me around, huh?

Walk into the room and you've had everyone
And then you walked into the room it's so sad everybody already knows

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played
Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade
Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on
Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing

"When good girls gone bad, they gone forever
But if she goin' with me than she goin' for better
Me without you, that's the longest never
Living like sunshine, man we on forever, yup
Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
 I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left saying good girls don't grow on trees
I felt like it was yesterday,
The times we had that went away
We're still young, but of course we felt a lot
Now I've been living like a villainess been shot
I met her through a friend of mine,
Who told me that this girl was fine.
I picked her up and I started to figure out
There's more on the inside than on the out

She said don't bother me 
She told me that I had to leave
I wanted her just to believe
Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left, good girls don't grow on trees
Helped me get my world in tact
She had my heart, I told her that
Now it hurts every time I think about
The very night that I started with acting out
The morning brought a painful sun
Knowing now just what I've done
She always was the better half for sure
The part of me in life that I preferred
I gave up all of me 
Though I tore her up inside
We still kept the love alive 
Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left good girls don't grow on trees
Woah, she's like a diamond out the rough
You know the good girls tainted by the bad world
The good girls hard to find
Woah, she's like H2O, can't get enough
Where are the good girls tainted by the bad world
, yo, OK
Look, top floor of the hotel suite
So connected that you know I got a motel cheap
I'm saying I know I don't deserve the Noble Peace
But damn, I don't deserve the ""Go to hell"" speech
Don't believe everything you see up in a photo
When I'm with you, I wish that time could move slow-mo
The day I met your granny I dreamed about our family
And maybe one day we'll turn that group into a photo
When good girls gone bad they gone forever
But if she goin' with me than she goin' for better
Me without you that's the longest never
Living like sunshine man we on forever
Amen, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sexing

You were new in town, I was nineteen
And sparks flew
They called us crazy behind our backs
""Romnatic fools"" we just let them laugh
Because we knew
It may be a long shot
We may get lonely down the line
But love knows no reason
And I won't let 'em make up my mind
My money's riding on this dark horse, baby
My heart is saying it's the lucky one
And it's true color's gonna shine through someday
If we let this, let this dark horse run
The stars are brighter in the desert sky
No need to wonder or justify
Where this will lead
I wear your locket, our picture's inside
Inscription says 'the joy's in the ride'
And I believe
That something so sacred
Is something worth this kind of fight
Cause love knows no patience
You can't please everyone all the time
My money's riding on this dark horse, baby
My heart is saying it's the lucky one
And it's true color's gonna shine through someday
If we let this, let this dark horse run

Blow like hell and bring down thunder
When your raging's through, I'll cut that oak in two""

His ancient pride was burnt and shaken
But something deep inside did waken
He raised his limbs just like Moses
And blossomed roses
He blossomed roses

The ancient oak he still is standing

Journey through the darkenss as your hearts refuse to die
In the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come
With the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
Far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
When the time has come for the battle now we follow with the horde
We will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
In the land of long ago forever in our souls
Fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
In ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again
Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
Fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning
Sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
As you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
You feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
There's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day
Can't you see the history the suffocating madness
In the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go
I have traveled far and wide across the wasteland
Still searching for the answers for the right to understand
Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads...
Riding through the starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky
A shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died
Our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done
Blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come

"A world filled with love is a wonderfull sight
Being in love is what's heart's delight
But that look of love isn't on my face
That enchanted feeling has been replaced
As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe,
The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows, searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and prayin' for someone who care
Always movin' and goin' nowhere
What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me, please
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look
There's a growing need
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending
Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday
I know I've got to find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere",Pop
"When good girls gone bad, they gone forever
But if she goin' with me than she goin' for better
Me without you, that's the longest never
Living like sunshine, man we on forever, yup
Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
 I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left saying good girls don't grow on trees
I felt like it was yesterday,
The times we had that went away
We're still young, but of course we felt a lot
Now I've been living like a villainess been shot
I met her through a friend of mine,
Who told me that this girl was fine.
I picked her up and I started to figure out
There's more on the inside than on the out

She said don't bother me 
She told me that I had to leave
I wanted her just to believe
Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left, good girls don't grow on trees
Helped me get my world in tact
She had my heart, I told her that
Now it hurts every time I think about
The very night that I started with acting out
The morning brought a painful sun
Knowing now just what I've done
She always was the better half for sure
The part of me in life that I preferred
I gave up all of me 
Though I tore her up inside
We still kept the love alive 
Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left good girls don't grow on trees
Woah, she's like a diamond out the rough
You know the good girls tainted by the bad world
The good girls hard to find
Woah, she's like H2O, can't get enough
Where are the good girls tainted by the bad world
, yo, OK
Look, top floor of the hotel suite
So connected that you know I got a motel cheap
I'm saying I know I don't deserve the Noble Peace
But damn, I don't deserve the ""Go to hell"" speech
Don't believe everything you see up in a photo
When I'm with you, I wish that time could move slow-mo
The day I met your granny I dreamed about our family
And maybe one day we'll turn that group into a photo
When good girls gone bad they gone forever
But if she goin' with me than she goin' for better
Me without you that's the longest never
Living like sunshine man we on forever
Amen, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sexing
Good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messing
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from a girl just left

"Did you know you have a special way of turning around my terrible days, you make all the bad things go away the second that you say hello. Its the way that you talk, that you laugh, that you smile, if beauty was inches you'd go on for miles, it's the way that you make everything seem worth while, the second that you say hello. It's the way every love song reminds me of you along with the stars and the sunset here too, it's the way that you make the sky seem much more blue, the second that you say hello. So if love is a drug then I guess I'm addicted, all I want is to have yours its making' my heart sick. Goodbye is what broke it and you were what fixed it the second that you said hello.",Indie

A souped up strut on swollen feet

What memory knows I can't repeat
Offered army soul salvation
Sandwich choice of God and nation
Haloed voices, chiselled faces
Fill my head with empty spaces
Out of the breakdown of the whole

Out of a life put on hold
Once again a bulldog baby
Classified as cheap and lazy
Inner pity meat mutation
Pay the price for approbation
Welcome to the new dictators
Power, drugs and imitators

All good children love to hate her

"I built a friend with three pieces of plastic and a pen,
I made him on the table in the den,
I gave him my old cellphone for a head,
For a head.
And we spent holidays in my house,
And we left presents in the stocking,
And we bought bolts and things and strings and a new watch,
That's what he got.
And we had so much fun together,
We knew we'd be friends forever.
And we had so much fun together,
we had so much fun.
Then I left for college in September
And we wept cause we can't be together
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend,
My old friend.
Then I met this girl at graduation
And forget my oldest creation
And I guess I'll see him next vacation
Send my best, I send my best
And we had so much fun together,
We knew we'd be friends forever.
And we had so much fun together,
we had so much fun.
I came home to find him on the table with a note
Scribbled out in pencil and he wrote
That he just wasn't stable all alone,
All alone.
Next to him, an empty glass of water that he spilled
All over the body that I built,
It fizzled and it popped and then it killed,
And then it killed.
And we had so much fun together,
We knew we'd be friends forever.

There's an old town dump with some fools gold
Just waiting for a bandit's hand to steal
What one soul lost I'd always find
It's wild what some folk leave behind
But a poor boys dreams can always make it real

Cause I threw stones at broken bottles
I washed my hands in God's rainwater
I found treasure others wouldn't claim
I threw stones at broken bottles
Took what this life had to offer
And I let it shine when others make it rain
Let it shine when others make it rain
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
When others make it rain
While driving through the promised land
Out there in the drifting sand
I saw a boy who looked at lot like me.
As I rolled my window down
I yelled across that one-horse town
I said, don't give up boy, you've got the right to dream!

Being armed up to the teeth that means you don't have to run
Better safe than being sorry, better alive than being dead
Better him than me you say as you aim your gun at his head

It's peace you say that you fight for but it's war you declare
Take a life to save a life you call that living in peace?
It takes more than a piece of metal for the peace to increase
Are you man enough to hold a gun?
Are you man enough to turn your back and run?
Are you man enough to take a life?
Are you man enough to make one?
With your finger stuck on the trigger you're one hell of a man
But you won't be much of a macho when the blood's on your hands
If you live by the gun you'll die by the gun I promise you that
And you ain't got a goddamn thing if all you've got is a gat

Than live pretending a gun will keep me safe from bodily harm

Take my hand and Ill walk you through the fire.
Fear no evil I will cover you my child.
And when the waves come crashing all around,
I will be the one to lift you off the ground.
And when you hear this lullaby,
Know I think of you every time.
Because youre my night light,
My night light,
Youre the night light in my dark.
Take my hand and Ill walk you down the aisle
Let her look to be the grace behind your smile
Find a love that mirrors who we are
Keep the wonder in your eyes and shine like stars
And when you feel the tears well up inside,
Just call my name and Ill let you cry.
Because you are my night light,
My night light,
Youre my night light in my dark.
And when you feel the tears well up inside,
Just call my name.
Call my name.
Youre my night light,
My night light.
Youre the night light in my dark

Youre my night light,
My night light.
Youre the night light in my dark.

"Every time you go away I know it wont be for long though it seems,
And all the time we spend apart that ticking tock clock seems to last for weeks.
Well I guess it is quite long to expect you to climb up here each week,
Yes I guess it aint so long four hours on a bus for yous a treat.
And it wont be long x2
All day long I sit here, x 3
Thinkin bout you.
Yes I know theres a million miles and aeroplanes, they keep us apart,
But when I sit alone at night on my bus darling well your in my heart.
And it wont be long x2
So complicated times have passed, but am sorry babe I feel the same for you.
Yes I know I broke it off but am sorry babe ya just didnt stay true.

Beneath them sits the wrath of their sickness
No Mercy, No Pity, wind swept sands of the blistering light.
Farewell greenfields and birds of flight...

"A woman is a female who is human,
Designed for pleasing man, the human male.
A human male is pleased by many women,
And all the rest you hear is fairy tale.
Then tell me how this fairy tale began, sir.
You cannot call it just a poet's trick
Explain to me why many men are faithful
And true to one wife only.
They are sick!

With honey for just one man.
A man must be like honey bee

"Oh yeah
Whoa oh

There's this girl I know, she feels unknown
Just wanna have attention, cries on her own
Got nobody to go to she feels so scared
Doesn't wanna go to school, cries in her bed
She got a couple friends they think she's okay
Inside the pain haunts her, day by day
She still hasn't given up, she doesn't see the point
She just wants happiness but emotions disappoint
She blames herself, it drives her mad
For every single little trouble that she's ever had
The pain she endures you can see it through her shirt
Bearing the scars of society's burns

No more pain
No more tears
There's no need to cry no more there's nothing left to fear
No more pain
No more tears
You don't need to lie no more cause' now you know we're here

She hides herself, no one hears her cries
If only you could see the world through her eyes
All she wanted, is one little friend
To stick by her til the very end
She didn't ask for a lot, in fact nothing at all
Yeah she was still hit around and called a fool
She didn't wanna fight
She just wanted some love
When she was lonely just one hug
And to feel like she was accepted
Instead of pushed around, left out and rejected
You gotta stay strong nothing lasts forever
You are never alone, we'll do this together

No more pain
No more tears
There's no need to cry no more there's nothing left to fear
No more pain
No more tears
You don't need to lie no more cause' now you know we're here

She can't take it no more
She's taken enough
She's been strong for so long but she ain't that tough
Scared of letting go but no one seems to care

Scared to carry on cause' there's no one there
A frustrated girl, bearing the scars
Fighting her fears behind spiritual bars
One day this girl, I saw her face
She messed it with a smile 
She broke down in tears, said I saved her life
Crying, she asked, ""Can I be your wife?""
I answered, ""Hey there girl, tell me what is wrong""
She told me everything so I dedicate this song

No more pain 
No more tears 
There's no need to cry no more there's nothing left to fear 
No more pain
No more tears
You don't need to lie no more cause' now you know we're here
Ooooooo
No more,

"There's a space between dark matter, the pupils of your eyes.
A classroom of stars make light for a bad situation.
Does it matter if we fight, the path that we chose won't turn out right.
You think it might and you lie, it's a sad situation.
I know it hurts, but I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore, I can't do it anymore.
It can't get much worse but I don't feel it anymore.
No, I don't feel it anymore, I can't love you anymore.
I cant, I cant.
I promised you nothing, I followed through just fine. Brought you an aging life with time.
Your eyes saw a sad situation.
A bad taste in my mouth, a glass full of wine, cleansing my sins, cleansing my mind. I hope that it dies, in time. It's a sad situation.
You need a love that sweats in fear, you need a love so honest and clear.
I need a love that's scared of the dark to hold in my arms.
I know it hurts, but I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore, I can't do it anymore.
It can't get much worse but I don't feel it anymore.
No, I don't feel it anymore, I can't love you anymore.
It's way past our time, I give up, I don't mind. I need someone to nest with my heart.
Let the birds fly away, you go south, I'll go far, make a break for the northest part.
I'll open my eyes to a thousand skies and the love from a falling star.
Will never come back, I promise the feeling is not coming back.
I know it hurts, but I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore, I can't do it anymore.
I know it hurts, but I can't love you anymore

"Just like it's snowing in the summertime
Something's different and I can't explain it
It's like I'm breathing in sunshine
It's taken over and I can't contain it
This love is changing me
It brought me to my knees
Now it's teaching me to fly
That's how it feels to be with You
It's like I'm finally alive
That's how it feels to be with You
I always thought I was invincible
I never knew that I was waiting on a breakthrough
My heart was always only half full
Until the moment that I finally found you
It's everything I dreamed
Even more it seems
To fall into your arms
I could never get enough of how it feels
My heart can't deny how it feels",Rock

Behalve dan me reet
Niet dat het me niet interesseert

Vannacht lag ik weer wakker mam

De hele nacht de Beatles mam

Laat me slapen

Heb ik de oplossing bedacht
En ik heb hem terug gegeven
Ik heb hem teruggegeven
Aan de jongen die hem bracht
En toen pas kwam ik langs die zin
Die wel de waarheid raakt:
'Het leven is wat je gebeurt
Terwijl je andere plannen maakt'

The struggle is over, the boys are defeated,
Old Ireland's surrounded with sadness and gloom,
We were defeated and shamefuIIy treated,
And I, Robert Emmet, awaiting my doom.
Hung, drawn and quartered, sure that was my sentence,
But soon I will show them no coward am I.
My crime is the love of the land I was born in,
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.

Bold Robert Emmet will die with a smile,
Farewell companions both loyal and daring,
I'll lay down my life for the Emerald Isle.
The barque lay at anchor awaiting to bring me
Over the billows to the land of the free;
But I must see my sweetheart for I know she will cheer me,
And with her I will sail far over the sea.
But I was arrested and cast into prison,
Tried as a traitor, a rebel, a spy;
But no man can call me a knave or a coward,
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.
chorus:
Hark! I the bell's tolling, I well know its meaning,
My poor heart tells me it is my death knell;
In come the clergy, the warder is leading,
I have no friends here to bid me farewell.
Goodbye, old Ireland, my parents and sweetheart,
Companions in arms to forget you must try;
I am proud of the honour, it was only my duty-
A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.

"On a holiday
or a special vacation
Minds are drifting out to a new location
What an easy way
to get away away for a while
Don't bring a thing
because we won't be moving a mile
It's all in a dream
And it's the best place I've been
Up in the sky with no aeroplane
Loving every minute of paradise
Behind my eyes there's no goodbyes
In a sordid way
I had an awful day yesterday
I lost my cool with my girl
so she tippy-tip-toed away
Here I am, wow, I'm a lonely guy
No one cares for me
I went home that night and cried myself to sleep
Should've been in a dream
Cause that's the best place I've been
Up in the sky with no aeroplane
Loving every minute of paradise
Behind my eyes there's no goodbyes
Up in the sky with no aeroplane
Loving every minute of paradise

No more fear and no more regrets

No more gods, no war

We will never fall
We will never see him again

It's all that we are longing for

They've fooled you to take it away
So no more myths
No more bliss
We are holding it in our hand
And there is nothing they can do

If I called you, would you believe what I had to say,
And if I saw you, would you, turn and run away.
If I had my way girl, you'd be with me right now.
Someday, someway, somehow.

I thought that I could go on without you.
Guess what? I was so wrong,
And I realized how much I really love you,
And it's been far too long.

If I called you, would you believe what I had to say,
And if I saw you, would you, turn and run away.
If I had my way girl, you'd be with me right now.

That it's been leaving on my steady cl

May not be as permanent as I once feared
And the shadows on the stool
Aren't as shy as they appear

You thought I never once adored my coldest feet
And since ignored the only girl I ever truly had
So take your coat and go
You'll need it when it's colder
Or stay with me tonight
And watch me waste my only chance
To hold her
It's the only way to learn about mistakes you've made
At 3 am
'Cause she has poise, she has thunder
She speaks a love that's never shown
And I'm not sure that she'll remember
Those many nights she left me here alone
'Cause I'm a drunk and I deserved it
There were more than subtle signs
There's no reflection in the mirror
What I once believed was here
It's getting clear I struggle with my mind
So take your coat and go
You'll need it when it's colder
Or stay with me tonight
And watch me waste my only chance
To hold her
It's the only way

Before I could even phone you I had to borrow a dime
I had nothing to give you and still you said you'd be mine

A big night on the town for us used to be
Just two glasses of wine on our first anniversary
Oh I know you could have more but you stuck by me those were the sweet years
But I wasn't happy though you were complained
I wanted to give you more than just my name
I wanted to buy you not wine but champagne and then came the hard years
Cause I started working harder and longer than ever before
Just to buy you all the things that you never even asked me for
And I never noticed but you changed more and more those were the sad years
But the price of success just kept goin' up
And even when I had it all I didn't want to stop
For some reason it became importanted to me to stay on the top
Those were the selfish years
And then I stopped one minute of my busy day
I felt like something was missing and what I couldn't say
And when I realized that it was love that had died away and then came the bad years

Different words upon the

Yesterday.
I'm still thinking of a past.
Just how long does this expect
To last?
I was once a simple man.
I had everything,
You understand?
All those things I chose inside,
Turned to blood and stone
From all the lies.

Once again...

"I found a flower in a field
A field of cars and people, Rows of concrete, paint, and steel
Manhattan is where it grew
And I thought, to cut it from its stem
And take it from the cracks
Between bricks that it lay in
And save it from city strife
Away from the city life
Then someone, they whispered in my ear
A county girl can't be made out of anybody here
Don't touch it, it loves you not
Don't touch it, it loves you not
Cause blue birds, Don't fly without their wings
And when we put them in a cage
The world can't hear them sing
So selfish when greed sets in
Possession, the king of sin
And people don't ever let you down
Forever find a way to kill whatever love they've found
A heart beat and I want it too
Manhattan is where she grew
So I left and I let the flower be
And yesterday saw the flower on cable TV
Much prettier than here with me
For all of the world to see
Much prettier than here with me",Country

Make that money pile
Build up my brand

Greenhouses prisons for slaves

Let's call a spade a spade 
I saw a man eating celery, so I beat him black and blue
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two
I'm a political prisoner trapped in a windowless cage
'cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a
rage
I told the judge when he sentenced me, this is my finest hour
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower

A sudden cry broke the peaceful silence
As an old man stood on the edge of the world
Staring with tired eyes into the endless sky
There's a secret, and with regret
He looks eastwards, there where the sunrise starts
Since eons the faith lived on, one day they will come from outer space
With an ardent look, he's awaiting them, the ancestors of a lost race
And soon his longing will be rewarded
A giant arrow will tear heaven apart
Unseen creatures coming down
And just mysteries are left for those who came as the next
There's a secret, and with regret
He looks eastwards, there where the sunrise starts
Some centuries later, chaos rules in nature, the old man died long ago
The ancient tradition's wiped out by the arrogance of mankind
One day a flash will point at the grave,
Another old man will go there again
He'll hear the weeping from inside the grave
While they're waiting for a new sign of the strangers
Smash the secrets, feel no regrets
Oh see how nice, this last sunrise
Smash all secrets, feel no regrets
Oh see how nice, this last sunrise",Metal

"On a hillside in Hazzard
Sets a new double-wide
God's little acre
Your paradise
A poor boy found heaven
With a good country girl
He had all he wanted
She was his whole world
But working the coal mine
Can wear a man down
He started spending
Too much time in town
He found temptation
Fell under it's spell
And hillbilly Heaven
Went to honky tonk Hell
From hillbilly Heaven
To honky tonk Hell
From a warm home fire burning
To a cold, cheap motel
And an angel is crying
'Cause her good man fell
From hillbilly Heaven
To honky tonk Hell
Somewhere in Hazzard
On a dark, dead-end street
Where whiskey and heartache
And old memories meet
He looks for salvation
In a bottle each night
And just goes on livin'
Though he's lost his life
Now there's a job in the coal mine
That needs to be filled
And a heartache in Hazzard
That won't ever heal
He had it all
Now it's all for sale
And hillbilly Heaven's
Gone to honky tonk Hell
From hillbilly Heaven
To honky tonk Hell
From a warm home fire burning
To a cold, cheap motel
And an angel is crying
'Cause her good man fell

"Sunday morning in the valley we would gather for the service
You would always run to meet me you'd smile at papa kinda nervous
All the people came from miles around and I can still hear the sound
As they sang thanks to the Lord for the sun up in the sky
For the corn that's growin' high and for the child that didn't die
Thanks to the Lord for the crops and for the farm
For the satrenght in my right arm and for keepin' us from harm
And I say thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks to the Lord for a girl like you

Come the day that we were married with all our folks from the congregation
Honey you looked just like an angel the sweetest thing in all creation
Papa hugged me and my mama cried everybody smiled with pride
As they sang thanks...
Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks to the Lord for a girl like you",Country

But I still mean em, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that?

Can't look into the future
As my eyes see not the light of day
Maybe you remember the game you played
Me and my queen years ago?

What cruel deed has she now done?

If there's a time when the tears should fill your eyes
And you can't see past the shadows
To the sun on the other side
Don't despair because there always will be someone there
Don't lose faith
Love won't let you lose your way, because you
You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside and you
You'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone
Love is standing by
Oh yes it is, yes
If there's a day when the rain should find your heart
And your cold inside and lonely
And this world has you in the dark
Don't be scared you can just reach for me and I'll be there
Don't lose hope
Love will see you through you know, because you

Standing by to lift you up of all the the hurt and pain
Standing by to carry you through

He did not die in vain

When we look back again

"Ayo, this kid in Australia said he idolized me
If you don't know why then it's time to watch me
A young papi with the confidence of Rocky in a boxing match
Early mornings, practicing my rhymes, 13 rocking a stocking cap
Skinny nigga, I told my reflection I'll never settle
Said if I gain some weight then I would one day try to wrestle
Wanted to play ball and be a UNLV rebel
When I let my talent go to waste cause I couldn't keep up my grades
What a shame
Now I'm living out my second dream, grown into some shit you've never seen
Now I'm onto better things
It just goes to show when you travel a lot and you be on the road
We all striving to be comfortable and happy
But in life we go the distance
A major part in life is building the life you wanna live with
I know we lack patience, but you gotta stay consistent
Only you can slow you down, turn your dreams into commitments
Making sense with a sentence, Golden Age and I'm vintage
1990 to now, what we doin', they did it
You could be fooled in a minute
I'm just tryna talk that shit until I'm finished
The lost soul that's protected by my religion

Lately I've been feeling a certain way
Peace signs in every picture that I take
I represent World Peace
Smoking weed until the feeling goes away
Spreading love until I'm in and out my day
I represent World Peace
I'm extremely excited, without it hidin'
Niggas see me smilin'
But y'all niggas don't know the half of it
I'm talking bout a kid that grew up without havin' shit
And sorted out a plan, and then turned into a man
Y'all understand the fans, and how fans follow the artist
But what if one man give em something other than trends?
What you recommend, what you steppin' in?
Who you follow, what you represent, nigga what set you in?
Now we all started from the bottom
Started with a problem, before I was ever crawlin'
I was born into my miseries
Came out with my hidden talents, now the rest is history
Riding, but if you ain't providing, that don't mean shit to me
You could be the hardest nigga walkin'
But the hardest niggas working is the bosses
Keep it authentic, cause the image got you confused
Anybody would tell you it's a lose lose

Yo fundamentals was rented, and it's a bunch of you
Me, I been the same since my momma was buying lunchables
Grew through some functions, respected cause I'm lovable
Think good thoughts, speak good words
Take good actions, yeah that's what the world deserves
A man in power, that's gon' empower the people first
And Howard College, they listen, came all the way from the dirt
Agree to disagree, judge me cause I'd rather have them legalize
A plant, then feed the people nicotine
Sell the devil's juice, and they gon' support it by any means

The dried darkness started
Gloating over the last
So marvelous banquet
Rummaged out by the laughter
Of desire
The ferryman stood up
And poured the blood on the table
A noise was made
God himself raised his tired eyes
And went worried away
Satan was looking avidly
Attracted woman with his eyes
And possessed one alive on the table
He laughed at gods
Laughed at their helplessness
He showed the beauty of his body
Changing into snake
He slipped between things
Gods couldn't spot that
Choked by immortality
It's a night of unification
And Satan laughed at their old age
He will give birth to
The god of one moment
Of one tear
Who having touched the blood
Will find death in it
He was full of contempt for another gods
But he suffered cause he knew
That his son, who would never
Experience nether suffering nor joy
Would die having touched the blood
And there's plenty of blood everywhere
If you were a creator, Sun
The Power would fall down before you
And children would fall down before you
And children would and the feast on they knees
In you were a creator, Sun
You wouldn't have let gods to come to Earth
And tears are gathering together
And laughing at our weakness
And our subjection that resembles

In these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?

And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord

The Fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
I stand alone
Noone's by my side
I'll dare you
Come out
You coward
Now it's me or you
He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries
Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned

The iron crowned
Is getting closer
Swings his hammer

Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain

and i was younger then i wore my hair
in bows across my forehead
soon they will twist it at the shoulder
and fix the clasp against my neck
and i do not think you would know her
if you could see what they reflect
I've seen my future in an evening dress
all wrapped in tapestry and fur i guess
remember me the way you knew me best
oh Gabriel i have kept
everything you sent me
everything you put to paper but
it's better to forget
than fill your head with memories
think that you will thank me later
oh Gabriel i wish that i
could pick you up and fold you like a ribbon
I'd keep you always and in secret
in the pockets of my clothes
but this is how i live my life
with all the parts that i was given
this is the heart that i was given
and what you're given can be sold

where diesel machines roar by
Pale dawn, at the scrapyard gates
Fast food parks and hardware mines
Not smiling or frowning they,
the shades on the fringe of town,
unpaid, idle, lending shape
to the gravity which they say
has dragged this country down
This beautiful country down
Close off the backstreets, no-one goes
Bring on the ice, the game-shows: brain-blister
The bigger the roadside crowd
the denser the gameshow cloud
There's nothing on that churning screen
Just nonsense that might mean:
""Like it? Good. No? Tough!
Pen them in and shut them up
Slow march, eyes right
Save all your revolution for your Saturday night!""

You earn but you feel oppressed
The armour could do with a test
Why not betray your lover's trust?
Go ahead and push it until it bursts
You're back on the streets again
No armour, no dreams, no friends
The worst pain is behind the eyes
Where the killer of futures hides, still hides
They've closed the backstreets, you can't hide
If you feel brave, just step outside
where all tomorrows stink the same
Where night vibrates with cries of:
Brain-blister

The lands of my fathers the gallant and brave
To make room for the sportsmen, their lands were all taken
And they had to seek out new homes far away
Oh shame on the tyrants who brought desolation
Who banished the brave and put sheep in their place
Where once smiled the gardens rank weeds in their station
And deer are preferred to the leal-hearted braves
Oh where are the parents and bairns yonder rovin
The scene o' their gladness is far o'er the main
No blithe-hearted milk-maid now cheers at the gloaming
The herd-boy no longer seen on the plain
But the lark is still soaring; she sings in her glory
With no one to listen her sweet morning lay

Like chaff in the wind, they were borne far away",Folk

Until I found you in the arms of someone else

Until the best of sweethearts became the best of strangers

Each time they introduce us makes it harder to forget

Money make the world go round, as the world turns
Money make the world go round, as the world turns
Nigga I need money to main-tainn
Hustalin ain't a game

Coc-ainee and Herione

Nigga I bring the pain
You thought shit stay the same

Put a bullet in your brain
Nigga at close range
Run away wit ya rollie, your rings, and your motherfuckin chain

I'm about my money mang
Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I ain't playin'
Better understan what I'm sayin',
What I'm sayin, I ain't playin'
I'll be, In front of your crib, layin', wit the mack to start sprayin'
Any nigga that's in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lame
Crackers'll put ya in chains
Box'll drive you insane
Sun can't shine all the time, man its gotta rain
That whole loose? is ill
You better crack the whip mang

A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin hoes 
A hustla ain't a hustla with no motherfuckin dough 
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke 
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke 
A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin hoes 
A hustla ain't a hustla with no motherfuckin dough 
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke 
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke 

I live
Life in the fast lane
Man I ain't got nuttin ta lose

Either you wit me or against me man ain't nuttin changee
Nigga, you

Walk wit a cane now nigga now

Nigga nobody hears your namee
You got down wit a gangg

Ya'll niggas do your thang
You got 2 felonies
Fuck it, go out wit a bangg
Ya'll niggas want to hangg
Wit niggas that fitlthy rich
They ain't even got ta talk
To take your bitch
One look was all it took
She seen the benz-o

And them big ol' chriz-omes
A-yo the bitch useta bring you dough
Useta be your bottom hoe
Now your paper comin' slow
She feel like she had ta go
Roll wit them rich niggas and ball with them ball-az
Politic wit the willies the real shot call-az

I got one life to live
Follow that light that keeps on guidin me
Hate-az tryin me
Hoes is a-bidein me
Media ride me
King a the underground
So the streets is steady hide-in me
Representin sure taste-az
The yay keep takin pride in me
Streets
Deciple slide-in me
Status reports the badest you caught
Walk in the black top wit fat rocks and had his newport
I can't stay away like Too $hort
I gots ta break a bastards back
Tore em up, get em ready ta port
Put em on the master track
I blast the facts the life in the grill
Gorilla pimpin
If I have ta mack ya wife then I will
It's me and 50 Cent my nigga
Live in trife, and that's real
Talkin shit on us, that's like pullin out a knife and don't kill

I'm on for million wit your pit, in the clit that shit true
I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you, without you even
knoin
Got you strippin and even hoe-in
You don't want to let the pro in the door
This what we showin

A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin hoes 
A hustla ain't a hustla with no motherfuckin dough 
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke 
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke 


Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now its time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine
Bitch!

Runnin from pimpin...bitch you need to run TO some pimpin
Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on hoe
You still ain't figured out what a hoe supposed to look like
Look at you motherfucka here
Huh bitch?
How you gunna catch some dates lookin like that hoe?
Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street
Bitch the sidewalk is for pimpin bitch!

"Everywhere around us someone's got something to say
Isolated outbursts but nothing goes away
Everyday you hear the words of destruction and fear
Always spreading our opinions
Without the willingness to hear
All this noise about nothing, drowning the meaning of it all
Outside this oral defecation the world is an empty stall
""Injustice over here! Hatred over there!""
Talk talk talk but the sin is everywhere!
Words words words...All we have are these?
Can we feed them to the poor or with them heal disease?
Talk talk talk...Is that all we will do?
Sacrifice ourselves we must go die for what is true
Take in information through the lenses you create
Never do a thing about the things you say you hate
Surround yourself with people who say what you want to hear
What keeps you from action is it selfishness or fear?
Talk about injustice do we really want it gone
It takes more than a zine or writing lyrics to a song
Scapegoat the middleclass if it covers up your guilt
No conviction penetrates the fortress you have built",R&B
"Come on baby it's a quarter to five
I've been living on the couch and I'm losing my mind
I haven't gotten a touch in a long, long time
Since Friday XIII part nine, going to hell
Thumbing through all the magazines
And I can drink a lot better than I could in my teens
Have we learned nothing but to kick and scream?
We're as civilized as we could have ever dreamed and what's that mean?
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
The kind of attraction I couldn't leave
Keep watching the static on TV
Might be as well but not as bad
When your silence shows of our public failure
I woke up in the middle of the night
Sheets soaked, still drunk, terrified
Something tells me you're not alive
The pulse keeps getting softer
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
Come on, baby
You've got something to lose
I'll buy you new clothes
I'll buy you new shoes
All kinds of things that we could really use
But all I need is you
I need you girl, you got that heart and soul
We've been living in the dark and digging our holes
But all that we need's right under our nose
Boy, don't you think I know?
I guess so
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
Please love me again",Country

"When I was a miller in Fife,
Losh! I thought that the sound o' the happer
Said, ``Tak' hame a wee flow to your wife,
To help to mak' brose to your supper.''
Then my conscience was narrow and pure,
But someway by random it rackit;
For I lifted twa neivefu' or mair,
While the happer said, ``Tak' it, man tak' it.''
Then hey for the mill and the kiln,
The garland and gear for my cogie,
And hey for the whisky and gill,
That washes the dust frae my craigie.
Although it's been lang in repute
For rogues to mak' rich by deceiving,
Yet I see that it disna weel suit
Honest men to begin to the thieving.
For my heart it gaed dunt upon dunt,
Oh, I thought ilka dunt it wad crack it;
Sae I flang frae my neive what was in't,
Still the happer said, ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
A man that's been bred to the plough,
Might be deav'd wi' its clamorous clapper;
Yet there's few but would suffer the sough,
After kenning what's said by the happer.
I whiles thought it scoff'd me to scorn,
Saying, ``Shame, is your conscience no chackit?''
But when I grew dry from a horn,
It chang'd aye to ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
The smugglers whiles cam' wi' their pocks,
'Cause they kent that I likit a bicker,
Sae I bartered whiles wi' the gowks,
Gied them grain for a sowp o' their liquor.
I had lang been accustomed to drink,
And aye when I purposed to quat it,
That thing wi' its clappertie clink
Said aye to me, ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
But the warst thing I did in my life,
Nae doot but ye'll think I was wrang o't;
Od! I tauld a bit bodie in Fife
A' my tale, and he made a bit sang o't.
I have aye had a voice a' my days,
But for singin' I ne'er gat the knack o't;
Yet I try whyles, just thinking to please
The greedy, wi' ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
Now, miller and a' as I am,
This far I can see through the matter;
There's men mair notorious to fame,
Mair greedy than me o' the muter.
For 'twad seem that the hale race o' men,
Or, wi' safety, the hauf we may mak' it,
Ha'e some speaking happer within,
That said to them ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''",Folk
"When I was only twelve years old
I fell in love with you, oh heart and soul

If you seek too deep
And the barmaid gently wakes you
If you fall asleep
And asks you if you need a cab

I ball like a dawg seven days of the week

See you chilling with a lame baby he ain't got change
Ain't no money over there, kick it with a millionaire

Let my pants hang and you know I'm on lean
Rolling with some O.G.'s, and they all tote beams
I'm the man in my city tell them get like me
I'm the man in the club blowing stacks every week
Ask your chick about the kid bet she wanna do me
And I let her put the donk, plus the stacks and the ki's
Give her drank in a Louis V. type things

See the jewels too loud baby girl I can't hear

Cash flow, nympho, see me in a '64
Pants hang low because the dough got me Krypto
Drop straight cash while you crabs at a rental
Eighty for the Jag', paper tags, what is info?
Money out the ass I don't brag I just get more
Say you getting cash, trying to flash I don't think so
Pull up in the jalapen Lamborghino
Up on a truck bet you've never seen those

"If it were oh just gone
If it just wasn't there
Would I disappear
Would I even care
Avoid in the arrangement
A blind spot in my mind
A space in what's important
A black hole of some kind

It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
Stumble two another day
Not knowing what is wrong
Not stolen not lost or broken
Been missing for so long
Can't quite find it in me
Fading pulse can I survive
My heart fails me again
Flat lined
But still alive
It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
Dragging it behind me,
Can't hold on any more
Slips through my fingers
And scatters on the floor
It hovers right above me
As I move from door to door
When I hang my head in shame
It lies then on the floor
Searching for what I may never know
It's missing I can feel it
Can't just let it go
When I reach out
I can feel it!
It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
It hovers right above me
As I move from door to door
When I hang my head in shame
It lies there on the floor
Talks from inside me, silent to most
Not the voice of god
Not the only ghost
Dragging it behind me,
Can't hold on any more
Slips through my fingers
And scatters on the floor
It lies there on the floor
Missing",Metal

Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
 yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin nothin but 
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, dj quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin
I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin
If you're born and raised in compton






Now compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is dj quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
Cause I'm a veteran from the c-o-m-p-t-o-n
Kick it

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
Dj quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

Yo, check this shit out
Right about now
I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy teddy bear
What's up nigga?
What's up kk?
My buddy d
We got amg most definitely in the house
What's up pretty greg and big baby brian cold chillin
Talkin about the armstrong pack
Straight got my muthafuckin back
To my buddy no way what's up, fool
Roche is in the house
My buddy donzelli
You know what's happenin, fool
What's up itch
And tony lang is chillin
To my nigga gangsta wayne
And my engineer joe gettin busy on the flo'
And last but not least I'd like to thank shabby blue
And we out

"I never thought you were the letter writing type
So now I see the words you chose the way you write
So I started to write back about the trees in the snow
And I saw a bird, couldn't see what it was but I thought you'd know
You always surprised me
And if I wrote You
If I wrote You
You would know me
And you would not write me again
And when the spring came and flooded all the streams
It's like how you got the night you told me all your dreams
And when the barn roof sagged after an icy bout
It's like how you got when you knew the truth was the only way out
But not the only way
And if I wrote you
If I wrote you
You would know me
And you would not write me again
We drew our arms around the bastard sons
We never would drink to the chosen ones
Well you know the way I left was not the way I planned
But I thought the world needed love and a steady hand
So I'm steady now
And I'm so happy
I had to tell you
And I love you
And you will not write me again
You will not write me again
You will not write me again",Indie
"My day is death
My night is dark
My love won't answer the call
With the rain like steel upon my face
My heart is certain to fall
Now I'm tired of sins corrupting me
And the fever turning me in
I don't know where I am headed to
But at least I know where I've been
My mouth is dry and I cannot speak
I've lost all faith in you
I admit I've lost a few
It's like my words against the wind
So I'm heading down to that long lost place
Where the light won't bounce off the floor
And as the world turns to stare at me
My footsteps head straight to the door
So I'm alone again in this lonely place
With no shadow at my side
My head is littered with your lust
And it's cold and it's rancid outside
And I'm outside
My mouth is dry and I cannot speak
I've lost all faith in you
I admit I've lost a few
It's like my words against the wind
I can't take this love and it's pulling me in
I'm tied to the floor and I'm cut at the seams
I'm crazy in love and I'm crazy to die
I'm lost to this world and I don't know why
Oh, and I don't know why
'Cause my mouth is dry and I cannot speak
I've lost all faith in you
I admit I've lost a few
It's like my words against the wind
And I've been down for twelve half-days
And I've kinda hit the floor
I'm reaching for something more
It's like my words against the wind
I'm against the wind
I'm against the wind now
Against the wind
Against the wind

"When I was young, me and my mama had beef
17 years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady, don'tcha know we love ya? 
Sweet lady, place no one above ya 
Sweet lady, don'tcha know we love ya?

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
You just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

I remember 
Right before I used to go to sleep 
Me and my mom 
My mom used to tell me to say 
Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray to the lord my soul to keep 
If I shall die 
Before I wake 
I pray to the lord 
My soul to take 
So much drama in a nigga life
I have to take the scenic route home, and check the closets at night
Not afraid of the dark, just what the dark hides
Killas with they facemask, tryin' to get my safe cash
If I catch 'em should I blast, nigga?
Hell yeah
Cause if they catch me up in they shit, I'ma dead man
My eye for your eye, that's what the pages read
By any means necessary, that's what Malcolm said
So I'ma a roll like a 20 inch mo-mo
Fuck a lot of hoes, make dough, and kick the bo-bo
It's hard but fair
MJG told your bitch ass
Quick fast, I make my shit last, and put you in the past
Don't ask cat, go get a mask and a gat
Snatch a nigga wife, and make her tell ya where them bitches at
Mafia style, break the code and I'ma break your back
Straight up dogg, I put the house on that
Chorus:
What you want to do?
Go to war man?
Well, talk is cheap, and the game done changed
Fights, only midnight gun blaze
So I say
Watch your back and don't come around my way

What must be
What shall be
That which is necesity to him that struggles
Is little more than choice to him that is willing
One of them fake niggaz, I'm hot like TNT
Blow up, and have you standin' in a puddle of pee-pee
See me, you couldn't do if you sight was 20-20
My lyrics so fat they made me go and call Jenny
Used to be poor like penny, not Anferne, but Janet
Until I unleashed my poetry upon the planet
Harder than granite
Player haters can't stand it
White folks would ban it, cause they children demand it
Tryin' to live a life, I've been fightin' to escape
Earnin' my respect, and never takin' breaks
Breakin' cakes
Everyday I'm on a paper chase
Shake and bake
Just so I could double up my ri-up
We buck, but don't nobody want to find that out
Murder niggaz lyrically instead of pullin' my gat out
Now I'm on some hard core, makin' me a mill shit
Nothin' but the real shit
Soldier in the field shit
Feel this,
Nigga life will never slow it down
You need to do like New Edition baby, cool it now
One of us gon' chill, it's gon' be me or you cat
Fuck what you heard, I put the house on that
Bitch
Chorus

You know 
I want you to remember 
Heaven is above all {heaven is above all)
And death is the judge that no king can corrupt 
And hell 
Hell is only the truth 
Seen too late 
Can you dig that? 
Lord forgive me for the anger that I feel today
Give me the strength to be a man, and turn my cheek the other way
The devil in the form of my enemy has tested me
Now I must retaliate before they get they best of me
No name callin', hoe, I wouldn't give you the pleasure
So you can run and tell niggaz that I'm the one jealous
Oh yeah
I'm supposed to fall for that punk shit
All you did was sign a contract, to get your ass kicked
Blasted
Found in a ditch with your wig split
Thinkin' that we niggaz on some rappin' kiddie kid shit
Dig this
Is my success a threat to you?
Nigga why you hate me, cause I do the shit I do?
Be true, nigga spit it or forget it
If I'm the one wrong, I'll be the first to admit it
And then we can get down, any way you want it
My nigg 'Twan told me
Ball, put the house on that mayne

Yeah man
To mothafuckers that don't understand this shit man
Know what I'm sayin'?
Nigga better feel me this time
I ain't goin'
You know what I'm talkin' about man?
Check this out man
Shit makes me hot man
Bitch ass niggaz man
Talkin' that shit man
Know what I'm talkin' about?

""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on em""

Of it become a storm.

"In this life, I breathe for you and me, for ourselves.
We tire endlessly in the way of when we disagree.
End the day again...and I feel the disheartening,
but I still go on in a destructive vow.
For you, it takes so long just to take back things you didn't mean...
and I will do the same...and it seems too late now.
It seems to be so innocent, just like a dream.
To get out of this tired scene,
and fuck up yet another day...and fade away all that I say.
Will me and you go on again, knowing this pain that it's been?
My invitation to keep killing me.
For all of what we have destroying this.
Indirect: a trait I'll never miss...
and I feel it surrounding me while you take the fall.

"When I first heard this song, I was a little boy growing up
Down in the state of South Carolina
The song had been written and recorded by a man named
T. Texas Tyler
The song in it's original form related to something that
Happened during the second World War
Last year, early in 1991, when things were going kinda crazy
Over on the other side of the world, I remembered this old song
And I rewrote the first part of it to fit the situation
The second part of it I left like it's been all of these years
Because you can't improve upon perfection
I'd like to dedicate this tonight to all the Veterans
To their families, their loved ones
And everybody that loves this country
It was a sweltering hot Sunday morning in the Saudi Arabian desert
And a young soldier sat alone in his tent, deep in thought
A picture of his wife and children back home in the United States
Rested on a table nearby
His mind began to wander across the miles
Back to other Sunday mornings that seemed so long ago
Now and so far away, he thought of home
And he knew that when this day dawned in America
His family would go to church to pray for his well-being
And his safe return
The young soldier reached into his bag and he took out
A deck of playing cards
He began to spread them out across his bunk
About that time, one of his buddies came by and said
""You gonna get up a game?"", ""No,"" the soldier replied
""I'm gonna spend a little quiet time with the Lord""
""Looks like to me you're playing cards,"" his friend said
""No, you see, I don't have my Bible and since we can't
Display our religion in public, here, I brought along this deck
Of cards"" and with that, the young boy started his story
You see when I look at the Ace, It reminded me
That there is but one God and the Deuce reminds me that
The Bible is divided into two parts
The Old and the New Testaments
When I look at the Trey, I think of the Father, the Son
And the Holy Ghost
When I see the Four, I'm reminded of the four Evangelists
Who preached the Gospel
There was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
And when I see the Five, I think of the five wise virgins
Who trimmed their lamps, there were ten of them
Five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out
And when I look at the Six, I'm reminded that in six days
God made this great heaven and earth
The Seven reminds me that on the seventh day
God rested from His great work
When I see the Eight, I think of the eight righteous persons
God saved when He destroyed this old world
There was Noah, his wife, their three sons and their wives
And when I look at the Nine, I think of the lepers
Our Saviour cleansed
And nine out of the ten, didn't even thank Him
And when I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments
God handed down to Moses on the table of stone
When I look at the King
It reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven
God Almighty
The Queen reminds me of the Blessed Virgin Mary
Queen of Heaven and the Jack or Knave is the Devil
When I count the number of spots on a deck of cards
I find 365, the number of days in a year
There's 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year
There's 4 suits, the number of weeks in a month
There's 12 picture cards, the number of months in a year
There's 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter
So you see, my friend
This deck of cards serves me as a Bible
As an Almanac and as a Prayer Book
And friends, this story is true
I know because I know that soldier",Country

I think of what I'd so
To keep you safe and sound
I would climb the highest mountain
I would swim the widest sea
I would wrestle a gorilla to the ground
I would fend off a dozen charging rhinos
I would catch a storm of killer bees
I would fight a firey dragon with a wooden sword
If I didn't know what this could do to me
'Cause it's too dangerous 
I'd really like to do it
But I might get hurt
It's dangerous 
I don't feel like bleeding
On my brand new shirt
You might say I'm cowardly
Or say I'll full of fright
You might call me yellow
And baby you'd be right!
So I'd skip across volcanoes full of lava
I'd even grab a tiger by the tail
I would make fun of
A boxing champion's mother
But my courage and my bowels both would fail
I would fight off a bunch
Of angry Kosacks
I would stop a thousand
Bullets with my hand
I would laugh
As my leg was amputated..
But baby, I'm not that kind of man!
'Cause it's too dangerous 
I use big words
But I never do the deed
It's dangerous 
I faint like a baby
If I see somebody bleed
I haven't got a backbone
I'm as timid as a mouse
I would find a cure for this
But I can't leave the house!
Cause it's dangerous
Too dangerous
Too dangerous

"As I was a'walking one evening of late
Where fragrant fine flowers the fields decorate
I carelessly rambled where I did not know
By the fair crystal fountain that falls in Glencoe
And on her who the prize on Mount Ider was won
Then approached me a lassy as bright as the sun
And the ribbon and the tartan around her did flow
That welcomed young Donald the pride of Glencoe
Said I, my fine creature, your charming sweet smile
And your comely fine features my heart has beguiled
And with your kind affection on me you'll bestow
I'll bless the happy hour we met in Glencoe
Kind Sir, she made answer, your love I'll disdain
For I have a young sweetheart and Donald by name
And he went to the wars about ten years ago
And a maid I remain 'till he returns to Glencoe
Ah, perhaps your young Donald regards not your name
And has placed his affection on some foreign dame
He may have forgotten for all that you know
That bonny young creature he left in Glencoe
From his promise my Donald he'd never depart
For love, truth and honour stand firm in his heart
And if I never see him, then single I'll go
And mourn for my Donald the pride of Glencoe
Then seeing her constance he drew out a glove
Which in parting she gave him in token of love
She clung to his arms and tears down did flow
Ah, you're welcome my Donald the pride of Glencoe
Come cheer up my Flora your sorrows are o'er
And since we have met love we'll never part more
And the loud blast of battle, far distant may blow
Whilst in peace and contentment we'll live in Glencoe",Folk

I've never known such perfection

I've never felt so at home

I want to open these veins
And never breathe again
Because the beauty is dead...

Then you should call the cops
And they should lock me up

With smiles on my innocent face

I only wanted to be loved
I only wanted to be in love

If imperfections are illegal
Then you should call the cops
And they should lock me up

Full of tears soaked in song?

And the corner of ""never again""

I'm done with this year
I'm tired of everyone here
I just need some time alone

There's gotta be something else out there for me
I could feel it in my heart the day I started to dream
There's more than this Midwestern town
I can't let this place keep me down
So I tell myself
There's a girl out on the coast of California
There's a world out there and it's waiting for you
And I can hear they're calling my name, tonight
Take me away I need the sand and the waves
The sunset and let's not forget those warm Autumn days
I just need to get out of here
And visit the coast just to see her

Till you're creating a streaming that falls forever

Strained to the back of my skull and I'm shivering

Where the last painting's gone and all that's left is black
Grey nights he's coming to me and
Some day they'll punish my deeds and they'll find
All the crimes
But then they ask when they gonna see them
Then they gonna ask to feel the ghosts, the walls, the dreams
We'll I've got mine
At last those coming came and they never looked back
With blinding stars in their eyes but all they saw was black
Fooled them hoping to seem
Like a slave of evil but the product of greed and
It's not a mass so be honest with me
We can't afford to ignore that I'm the disease
Practical since we had to be and

At first, it seemed as though she had only left
The room to go into the garden and had been delayed by stray
Chickens in the corn. Then he had thought she might
Have eloped with the rodeo-boy from the neighboring
Property but it wasn't till one afternoon, when he
Had heard guitar playing coming from her room and
Had rushed upstairs to confront her and had seen
That it was only the wind in the curtains brushing
Against the open strings, that he finally knew she
Wasn't coming back. He had dealt with the deluge alright
But the watermark of her leaving was still quite visible.
He had resorted to the compass then, thinking that
Geography might rescue him but after one week in the
Victorian Alps he came back north, realizing that snow which
He had never seen before, was only frozen water.

But was it really possible for him to cope with the
Magnitude of her absence? The snow had failed him.
Bottles had almost emptied themselves without effect.
The television, a Samaritan during other tribulations, had
Been repossessed, she had left her traveling clock

Another time-zone; so the long vacant days of expensive sunlight
Were filled with the sound of her minutes, with the measuring of her hours.",Indie

Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around

Not a rookie but a vet like dan marino
My favorite actor on the set al pacino
This is a heater man, hot like jalepeno
Follow the leader
40 from califoolya you hearing in your speaker
My life ain't no cartoon it's not animated like seta
Hot like a hot air balloonist I'm just an opportunist
The sooner the better you let me know that we can do this

Excuse me lady I been lookin at you from over here
And I was wondering if I could buy you a beer
And maybe later we can cud,
I don't want to be your man
I don't want to be the one let's have a one night stand
I know I don't know you and stuff
But maybe we could get to know each other
Over a couple of glasses of whatever's in this cup
I don't wanna go and dance
I don't wanna be the one let's have a one night stand
Let's get it cracking like some broken bones ,money mackin'
Talkin on them burnout phones, cadillacin'
Wood grain dash, and doors and floor mats
Good game cash, I stash the store raps
PS2 clarity, diamond watches and super bam botches
Eclair and cotches and choppers fresh out the boxes
I like to polish my rims and tires
Hundred spokes wide
With armoral baby wipes cause my baby drink wine
Nothing but the best on the flesh, just like sex
Rubbin lotion all on her gluteus maximus
I don't see no ring all I see is miss 60 jeans
Walking through the club like she ready to do some things
Full of that turtle, got 40 smelling like skunk
But everybody knows you can't smell yourself when your drunk
Posted at the bar I'm a star I get a bar
2-way me you're number I'll give a player a card

This is for my fuckers who lets in all my guys
There's a new rapper in town E40's on the rise
Known for having sic wit it records and jive ties
Business men always at work like barry white

You feel us, it's sick out here in the bay where we stay
You kill us, I wish that somebody would come and pray

Everyday's a holiday
Everyday may we celebrate
Everyday we modulate
Everyday may we perculate

"There's a part of the country could drop off tomorrow in an earthquake,
Yeah, it's out there on the cutting edge, the people move, the sidewalks shake.
And there's another part of the country with a land that gently creaks and thuds,
Where the heavy snows make faucets leak in bathrooms with free-standing tubs.
They're in houses that are haunted, the with kids who lie awake and think about
All the generations past who used to use that dripping sink.
And sometimes one place wants to slip into the other just to see
What it's like to trade its demons for the restless ghost of Mrs. Ogilvey,
She used to pick the mint from her front yard to dress the Sunday pork,
Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York.
It wants to have a family business in sheet metal or power tools,
It wants to have a diner where the coffee tastes like diesel fuel,
And it wants to find the glory of a town they say has hit the skids,
And it wants to have a snow day that will turn its parents into kids,
And it's embarrassed, but it's lusting after a SUNY student with mousy brown hair who is
Taking out the compost, making coffee in long underwear.
And southern California says to save a place, I'll meet you there,
And it tried to pack up its Miata, all it could fit was a prayer,
Sometimes the stakes are bogus, sometimes the fast lane hits a fork,
Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York.
Tempe, Arizona thinks the Everglades are greener and wetter,
And Washington, D.C. thinks that Atlanta integrated better,
But I think that southern California has more pain that we can say,
'Cause it wants to travel back in time, but it just can't leave L.A.
But now I hear they've got a theme park planned, designed to make you gasp and say,
Oh, I bet that crumbling mill town was a booming mill town in its day,
And the old investors scoff at this, but the young ones hope they'll take a chance,
And they promise it will make more dough than Mickey Mouse in northern France,
And the planners planned an opening day, a town historian will host,
And the waitresses look like waitresses who want to leave for the west coast.
And they'll have puttering on rainy weekends, autumn days that make you feel sad,
They'll have hundred year old plumbing and the family you never had,
And a Hudson River clean-up concert and a bundle-bearing stork,
And I hear they've got a menu planned, it's trÃ©s western New York.",Indie

Eran las diez de la noche
Estaba Lucio cenando, llegaron unos amigos
Para invitarlo a un fanando
Su madre se lo decia, su padre con mas razon Hijo no vallas al baile
Me lo avisa el corazon
Aaaayyyyyy Hhhhhhaaaaahhhaaa!
Lucio te van a matar
Montaron en sus caballos rumbo a la sierra mojada cuando llegaron al baile
Ya su rival lo esperaba
Lo invitaron a unas copas Lucio no quiso aceptar
Se hicieron de unas palabras para salirse a pelear
Le dieron tres pualadas de la espalda al corazon
Como le decia su madre Lo mataron a traicion
Aaaaayyyyy Hhhaaaahhhaaahhaayyy!

why do you call me baby
I told you my name is beyonce

"Loving me to you seems such a bother you made it easy for me to love another
So don't blame her for stealing me you let her
And where your love stopped she went a little bit father
You changed so much I was more at ease with a stranger
It wasn't so hard our love was already danger
She does everything that pleases me you never
And where your love stopped she went a little bit father
She went a little bit farther to make me feel love
She considered my feelings now she's all that I'm thinking of

"If I was a simple man,
Would we still walk hand in hand?
And if I suddenly went blind,
Would you still look in my eyes?
What happens when I grow old?
And all my stories have been told?
Will your heart still race for me?
Or will it march to a new beat?
If I was a simple man
If I was a simple man,
I'd own no home, I'd own no land
Would you still stand by my side?
And would our flame still burn so bright?
Sometimes I wonder why,
I'm so full of these endless rhymes
About the way I feel inside
I wish I could just get a ride

You'd be my sun; you'd be my light

"My, my Lagan love
My Lagan love
Where Lagan stream sing lullaby
There blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eyes
The night is on her hair
And like a lovesick lenanshee
She hath my heart in thrall
No life I own, no liberty
For love is lord of all
My Lagan love
And sometimes when the beetle horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling low
And through the dooreen peep
There on the cricket's singing stone
She stirs the bogwood fire
And hums in soft sweet undertones
The song of heart's desire

Her and her family had to move
There wasn't anything we could do

"COORTIN' IN THE KITCHEN
Come single belle and beau, to me now pay attention
And love, I'll plainly show, is the divil's own invention.
For once I fell in love with a damsel most bewitchin'
Miss Henrietta Bell, down in Captain Kelly's kitchen
cho:
To my toora loora la, my toora loora laddy
Ri toora loora la, ri toora loora laddy.
At the age of seventeen, I was 'prenticed to a grocer
Not far from Stephen's Green, where Miss Bell for tea would go, sir
Her manners were so free, she set me heart a-twitchin'
She invited me to tea, down in Captain Kelly's kitchen.
Next Sunday bein' the day we were to have the flare-up
I dressed myself quite gay, an' I frizzed and oiled my hair up
The Captain had no wife, he had gone out a-fishin'
So we kicked up high life, below-stairs in the kitchen.
Just as the clock struck six we sat down to the table
She served me tea and cakes --- I ate while I was able,
I ate cakes, drank punch and tea, till my side had got a stitch in
And the hours flew quick away, while coortin' in the kitchen.
With my arms around her waist, I kissed ---she hinted marriage
To the door in dreadful haste came Captain Kelly's carriage!
Her looks told me full well that moment she was wishin'
That I'd get out to Hell, or somewhere far from the kitchen.
She flew up off my knees, full seven feet or higher
And over heads and heels, threw me slap into the fire
My new Repealers coat, that I'd bought from Mrs. Stichen
With a thirty-shilling note, went to blazes in the kitchen.
I grieved to see my duds, all besmeared with smoke and ashes
When a tub of dirty suds, right in my face she dashes.
As I lay on the floor, still the water she kept pitchin'
Till the footman broke the door, and marched into the kitchen.
When the Captain came downstairs, and seen my situation
In spite of all my prayers I was marched off to the station
For me they'd take no bail, tho' to get home I was itchin'
And I had to tell the tale of how I got in the kitchen.
I said she did invite me, but she gave a flat denial
For assault she did indict me, and I was sent for trial.
She swore I robbed the house, in spite of all her screechin'
And I got six months hard, for my coortin' in the kitchen.

"I dream what these wings won't do
'Cause counting sheep is as easy as 1 2
Jumping out the nest to catch some bird food
Clutch so intense that the knuckles turn blue
I been hooped by wise men
Check horizons, read the flight plan
Spread the lifespan
Sky heights are set, it's time to climb these steps
We only try to get free from the spider's web
Gotta murder all the messing around
Carry the burden of work, never setting it down
With a spot like now, my shot, my chance
Put a plot of land in the pockets of my pants
Break loose, raise roof when the kick drops
They flew, straight through, no pit stops
Lift off with your head in the clouds
Or get lost in the rest of the crowd
Been here for too long
Said it's time to ride
Got to push it on
'Cause I aim for the sky
Times have come and gone
Yes, it's time to ride
Early in the morn'
Here's a quotable ?
Slash rap notable
Slash mic on the ? still controlling you
I'm rarely candid, my view panoramic
My eyes wide shut, if not one, I'm holding two
I'm packing double, getting up too early
I'm actually trouble, kind of acting 7: 30
Attracted to this Earth, maybe acting kinda worldly
But running on my work that says ""Ev I better hurry""
I'd rather worry death than being pushed in the line
Still a perfect ?, never late when I fly
Epic ? so this time when I rhyme
Not an ounce of death dying, stay late to the sky
Late for my prime, something that was shaped by design
I been running while the others hurt from racing a line
Making it great coincides with making it mine
Coincides with the hate that I'm making in signs
Let me start from the beginning, I rewind to the top
Pitch my heart in every inning like I did with the ?
And it don't stop, a body in motion stays in motion
Coasting in between the wings of this flowing",Hip-Hop

Walk on by, walk on by

"Seven years ago
I got on this boat
not knowing where
it would lead me.
But here we are,
with wounds and scars.
Still struggling to float,
and lost at sea.
So many storms have had my head,
capsizing, shipwrecked,
and breathing air that's soaking wet.
No wonder I curse like a god-damned sailor.
I've got all the stories but no anchor.",Rock

We, we came to fight
It's yo' disgrace, smash up your place, that's just polite
Once upon a time when crack was gold
And hip-hop was not yet platinum sold
I scoured the streets for stacks to fold
My mood like my hair was relaxed and blowed
I hated police and my teachers were beasts
My heat in the trunk of the classic Caprice
The one university, I knew the deal
So I cooked it, bagged it, put it on sale
Now philosophically you'd be opposed
To one inhaling coke via mouth or the nose
But economically I would propose
That you go eat a dick as employment froze
And I felt like an abandoned child
Left to fend for myself in the wild
While every courtroom, judge and gavel
Were there to bury me under the gravel
Or at the bottom of the finest malt ale
Observe, you'll find without fail
That in every neighborhood and penitentiary
There exists many others who are similar to me and
We, we are the ones
We'll seal your fate, tear down your state, go get yo' guns
We, we came to fight
It's yo' disgrace, smash up your place, that's just polite
In later years I lost some peers
Who mixed burners with Belvedere
And took shots from gung-ho cashiers
The world was cold yet hell was near
So I seek for a kilo
And my stack got a little bit taller like Skee-Lo
A street C.E.O.
There was all of this hell well and not one hero
The intensity was fortified
As I clenched five digits on the forty-five
Barely down at the retail store, I would detail more
But I don't wish this action to be glorified
There was a plan I was eager to listen
To not sleep in the park in the fetal position
Having to wipe off canine fecal emission
Otherwise I'd survive without legal permission
It's an equal division and then we go to prison
Which is a little decision
All I wanted was a Regal to glisten
And my kids would have meat in the kitchen
And complete ammunition
It's a given once the people are driven that
We, we are the ones
We'll seal your fate, tear down your state, go, get yo' guns
We, we came to fight

Get your work up, get your work up
Get your work up, get your work up
Get your work up, get your work up
Get your work up, get your work up
We are born from the mildew, the rust, the heathenous lust
The dreams in the dust, the evidence flushed
The grieving is just, they're thieving from us
Insulted and cussed, this evening we bust
Appears unstable and under the table
We like free speech but we love free cable
We're taught from the cradle, the Bill Gates fable
Which leads to high speeds in Buick LeSables
We have no excuses just great alibis
And poker faces you can't analyze
Our politicians sell our soul and our cries
With blood on their hands, they can't sanitize
We're the have-nots but we're also the gon'-gets
Not just talkin' 'bout the Lex with the chrome kits
You can get that by yourself with the four-fifth

You always saved your love for me no matter what the price
And even when you knew you'd lose you made the sacrifice
But I'm the one who always had to have somebody new
I'd laugh and say don't call me now look who's calling who
But let it ring please don't answer cause I don't know what I'd say
If I heard your voice I might break down and throw my pride away

"Never will it stop,
The 50 in the duffel won't crush,
It settles to the bottom like dust,
Fuck what ya heard,
You ain't countin' paper like us.
A million in the ceiling I can touch.
Go-getter.
I come from the corner like most niggas,
Now from afar, I toast niggas, roast niggas,
Anywhere, whichever the coast nigga,
Compare me to them 2 ghost niggas, Hail Mary.
Heart break when they tales fairy,
I kissed that girl and I likes it, like Kate Perry.
The tongue-tester, niggas on the corner
Juggle O's for the king, like a jester.
Child of a lesser, God, so when I drop the top
It's my way of feeling closer to the Lord!
Reaching for the heavens, 'till then, I settle for the 7,
30 floors upper room key, at the Western.
With her on her back, and her on her knees,
My ghetto ass trying to pronounce they dungarees.
I say Rav, they say Roxy mon',
They think it's real cute while they giving me dome.
Liva.
Heh, the cross I bear,
So fly in that purple label cloth I wear.
No matter the cost, I make Porsche like fear,
Every stitch, every seam, when I floss, y'all stare.
Ferrari 500 them horse I tear,
I circle, I veer, y'all pause like deer
In the headlights, mami play red light, green light,
And hop that red torch I steer.
There's no lLaw I've feared,
Arm glowin' like a roadside flare,
King-pin, so the soft I shared,
I carried, I huddled, I dared,
I muscled, I bled, I sweated, I teared,
Got crowned 'n got cheered.
You 10 Grand quarter-pound ration,
Went 36 flat, that's a asking,
Now two-thirds got it for a fraction, a cinder
Put in the dash 'n the fender,
Dryer sheets, that cover that scent that it renders.
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop.
Never will it stop,
The 50 in the duffel won't crush,
It settles to the bottom like dust,
Fuck what ya heard,
You ain't countin' paper like us.
A million in the ceiling I can touch.
And still don't nothing move but the money,
Nothing like 50 bricks, wrapped like the Mummy.
With the return ensures the second coming,
So tongue-numbing nigga, you can bet your last.
Not a gram off either, you can bet your ass!
I stay with the fifth, since niggas want to grab,
Fast-life, get it y'all is on the fast,
And them hos never say no, 'less they on they rag.
Louie bags, I trick 'em with good faith,
In hopes they return the favor, with good face.
Mentally, my mind in a good place,
Wake up e'ery morning admiring landscape
Hell, even my garage a menage,
Like my hoes exotic, same as my cars.
Million-dollar deposit, you suffer from withdrawals,
I got in the game in the bag like I'm Clause.
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop, ever, never,
Never will it stop.
Never will it stop,
The 50 in the duffel won't crush,
It settles to the bottom like dust,
Fuck what ya heard,
You ain't countin' paper like us.

Viewing lyrics for Morgado by Goats With Headlamps. Edit Lyrics?
I walked to the spring to find the source of it all
hoping the answer lied within
In the cool cool waters of the sprouting falls
I found the end is where we begin
I dug down deep into the dirt
searching for my treasure
and with each drop of sweat and the pains it beget
I found the same note in every measure
Morgado
All you need to know you already know
you gotta find out somehow
listen to the song in your soul
and you find it
No one can show you the way
You gotta live out your days
and when you are ready
you will know
I left my body and roamed the heavens
to learn something new in this place
and flying high above the earth and sky
I learned there is more to space than just space
I took to the ocean for twenty years and two days
to change my outlook on the world
with every wet book of matches and times I battened down the hatches
a whisper the winds would all unfurl
Morgado
All you need to know you already know
you gotta find out somehow
listen to the song in your soul
and you find it",Rock
"I'd say that I don't worry
And our parting brought no pain
I'd say that I'd be happy
If we'd never meet again
About the time I get 'em fooled
And think I'm really smart
I realize that I can't hide
My cryin' baby heart
Cry baby heart
I wished you were at home
So I could really laugh and say
I'm better off alone
But like an actor cannot play
I fumble through my part
I realize that I can't hide
My cry baby heart",Rock
"Dead Leaves and the dirty ground when I know
You're not around shiny tops and soda pops when I
hear your lips make a sound when I hear your lips make a sound
thirty notes in the mailbox will tell you that I'm coming home and I think I'd better sick around for a while so you're not
alone for a while so you're not alone
soft hair and a velvet tongue I wanna give you what you give to me and every breath that is in your lungs is a tiny little
gift to me
if you can hear a piano fall you can hear me coming down the hall if i could just hear your pretty voice I dont think I'd
have to see at all I dont think I'd have to see at all
I didnt feel so bad til the sun went down
I got back home no one to wrap my arms around
to wrap my arms around
to wrap my arms around

holy ghost if you're thinking of the holy ghost",Folk
"There is something special 'bout the way you show teeth
Making me an imbecile, what's hiding underneath

But I can't tell if you want it all

Braid the hair on my toes and the stragglers on my chest

Thinking what the heck
Will she see me standing here
Or am I just an object

Of course the night times are the worst
Of course I burn with an evil burst
You exist so I am cursed

The world will think I never had
an idea that could drive me mad
I'll be good 'till Thursday comes

Is this what the humans do?
My childish words just don't ring true
See ya later, great dictator

I'll be good 'till Thursday comes
Well, unless I am misleading you
You shine me up and make me new
I'll be good 'till Thursday comes

to watch the liar I've become

Ridin with death

My nigga now Majesty these niggas is after me murder redrum redrum redrum
My nigga now Majesty these niggas is after me murder redrum redrum redrum

You niggas better expect retaliation feel the playa hation

Top closing down on your caskets

Putting in work since a nigga thirteen
Sending niggas like yourself off in a hearse
See I won't hesitate to kill you wanna fill you with a couple of my slugs
Fucking with my thugs and I'm needing my love nigga what
Bone niggas fin to do a little damage
take over the planet with my daily tortures
Of course it's the nigga that's takin no shorts
Smokin on the newports your ghetto resource
And bitch you wanna dig your own ditch
and hit you with levels beyond your control
My momma never raised no punks and hoes
Just relear niggas comin up snatchin souls for dough
I know y'all motherfuckers out there somewhere ain't nowhere to hide
Makin motherfuckers feel the vibe for life
In the midst of the twist I'll be down to ride


We're ready for war

Ridin with death

We niggas rappin but still we actin like criminals


I'ma relent and furiated that you hated and pap pap can't fade it
We stay heavily sedated comin now back up my buck get shaken
Deeply dreaming about this demon my daddy told me it was comin
Trapped in the form of a bad omen it's wicked it was written I'll be
Runnin while turnin around and blastin back to buck 'em fuck 'em
They came back and moved and like I'm ready for war is that all you got
Heard the mack was talkin this and that bout some of my incidents
Said I smoke and snatchin purses you heard this lil EZ told me
Bitch clonin little EZ's niggas so fuck you you weren't original
Mono y mono ain't no subliminal Hey
When I regime in fatigues we ready to bleed even when they sleepin
Catch me caught me must have seen
And they're gonna get your ass next weekend


My mental seduction run your whole sound suction abduction of lyrics
Is the loss of life love and spirits
Capital offense for generics lost in the prison
Lieutenants overseeing the barracks checkin in
Mark ass copy cat incoherance is crucial
Smokin hay that bite shit like microchips
I watch you ride the rodeo straight to the bottom
When you're fate rotten, bitch, when I spot 'em I'ma drop 'em

Surrounded bby violence my nigga I'm bound to just live a lifetime
And this shrink wanna get inmy head cause I'm amongst the walking dead
All I really said if you niggas don't fled you gone bleed bloody red
Nigga shoot the spot and got ghosts fuckin with the mastermind of all time
Letting niggas know we off in our prime
It'll be that way to ninety-ninety-nine
Criminal-minded niggas been blinded
Looking for a style like Bone but can't see me
Just like mike everybody wanna be me
Study every movie nigga makin on tv
Easy does it do it easy what it is number one better check the score
Here we go nigga don't wanna fight no more
But I'm ready for you hoes and that's for sure

When the ghetto needs me I'll be grippin to the scripture picture
Little Ripsta can I get critical
And I'm seldom seen in the henessey when I ride up on my enemies
Zero one of my heroes Jesus blessed me to be lethal
With my automatic let you have it you don't wanna see any evil
Motherfuckers I'll take it to the people
then I will meet you at the funeral
Get 'em up Bizzy Mafiaso no witness is the usual
Further mo murder mo ready with guns I'll serve you hoes
When they call niggas hit the road
And when they get killed I'ma get your soul

You thinkin I'm slippin with niggas that itchin to rob me
Yes they want to give me bloody body
By pumping a couple of slugs inside me
But I'll be damned we won if it comes to guns and I'm
Stacking them thangs so you gets none statics automatic fun
Want some come come come execution redrum rum
See what you see in my eyes murder murder death defied
Burnt alive fried when they die
No one was able to find them cause they're bodies went up in a fire
Fuck they family try to creep
but you think I'm asleep cause I'm pumpin beats
Nigga better believe we keep much heat up under my seat yeah
Shoot 'em up quick in a minute and within a minute
You already suckas I bet that you bent it we sent it
We'll atest for the murder we should we dealt it
You thought you was flippin but got K.O.D'd
Ring-a-ling-a-ling get that ass up outta there
The undisputed thugs in harmony proved it
Kicked a couple of niggas asses
Gotta take off and stay still blastin
Locked in the state penatentiary but dog that ain't shit
Better make your money baby and pick up a couple of guns on the side
So when you ride and you get high don't let them haters run up your side",Hip-Hop

The things that you say mean nothing to me.
And all of this time you made me believe that I could break you

Because I cant breathe.

Show me how to smile a real smile
Make me new, make me see through

Im ridding my skin of its treacheries
Of wanting and flaunting and needing and greed and
Im throwing away my pride

"Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach.
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat.
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet.
I can't help but stare cause I got the best seat.
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in,
Said, ""I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean.
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees.""
Alright, you hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet.
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head.
One shot, two shot, copper tone red.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
Slow driving south with the drop top down,
Hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud.
You gave me that look, you licked them lips.
I said, ""Hang on baby, better pull over for this.""
Don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away.
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet.
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it.
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head.
One shot, two shot, copper tone red.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.",Country

Taxi's line-up like a strand of pearls around the block again

Every word came back to me the way it used to be

Should I climb aboardrisk everything-and ride it to the end?
Watch the hill like roller coasters up into the sky
And wish that you were here by me so close that I could die

How come your daddy run away your mama never did know

And you got acquainted with the back of his hand

The son called him daddy but he told you to call him John
You say the legs on the breast of the chicken was gone
When the platter come around your way
And you had to chop cotton while your step brother played
Stepchild when you were born
Your right foot was turned left with your left
And mercy had a way of taking off and leaving you by yourself
Stepchild muddy water got in your well
Stepchild how come your laughing that way
After doing the deed that you've done you better learn how to pray

You know a man likes a good time
He likes to wine and then dine
A beautiful woman
And love her thru the night
And if the lovin' feels right
He likes to do her two times
Pleasing that woman
Until she's satisfied
But when all the lovin's done
Who wants love that's on the run
One good time
But there's so much more
How 'bout conversation, some communication
Someone who loves you and stimulates your mind, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Using her mind all of the time, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a strong woman, who'll keep love comin'
All of the time, all of her life
You know a man likes to have fun
He likes to get into some tender young roni's
As pretty as they come
He likes to love all night long
And makes 'em feel they got it goin' on
Sometimes it's lonely 'cause there's no one at home
But when all the peaks are done
No one still knows anyone
We've had fun, but I need so much more

See mama, all I want you to do is hold it down for me
I want you to be my ride or die
While I go get this money, I promise I'm get us out the hood baby

Even though I'm in the streets
You know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper
You ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cause I ride or die girl we goin' be good
And if you ride or die we goin' make it out this hood

Listen
Baby look, just ride with me
Swear that I got us mama
One thing I love about it
See you ain't with that drama
You be my ride or die like Bonnie I'ma play the Clyde
Promise to move you out the hood into a bigger house
That's why you never trip I'm grinding bump a 9-5
Gotta get this money, paper calling but you never whine
Gotta ask the cash come with bags you should see your eyes
That's why I surprise about you stacks to ease your worried mind
Cause when I'm gone lil' mama home alone at every time
You never blowed my phone up yet cause you respect the grind
And you never holla bout a problem keep it on the line
My gutta baby, never maybe always gonna ride


And um, we can do them long vacations
Thinking Jamaica lately
Cant take them deep relations, baby just keep it patient
Shawty know what I do
Shawty know who I be
You know I'm in these streets the only way that we gon eat
I keep it gutta never cut her when we in them sheets
I get sum cutta grap the duffle then I'm in the streets
Come back with bundles pimp a half a g and Louie V
But you ain't tripping never question bout a nigga G
We keep it real ain't no other that could fill ya sneak's
I ride for you, you ride for me that's where we need to be
I hold you down, you hold me down and I fulfill your dreams
Your my Beyonce I'm hova wont you ride with me


Now what's the definition of a rider
Through it all they goin' stand right beside ya
If you got one look em in the eyes

Tryin' to tell you shawty that

Ace, and I promise this to you
I'ma get us out this hood
Into them places that you thinking that you never could
But you gotta ride like them tires on the mini coop
I'ma get this cash paper bags and give half to you
Forget them haters
Keep you tailored see whats sexy too
And I like your body all I think about is doing you
And I love the money so I guess it's like doing two
You ride or die same smile when you see the loot

Bra top, lots of G-strings, havin weed dreams
I'd be Queen if this the 1900's
cause niggaz gon get it, and E'RYBODY want it
I'm totin bags, eyes redder than a photo lab
The spins on your single, won't even top my promo ad
Hard drops quicker than jackers at the car lots
Couldn't get no harder if you went to School of Hard Knocks
The grimy bitch, sometime be punchliney bitch
So don't make me go there! 
Because the groupies are free, but the rhymes cost money..
OH YEAH!!
Chorus 2X

All my Flipmode niggaz just bounce to this
All my Rampage niggaz just bounce to this
All my Hurricane niggaz just bounce to this
All my niggaz if you with me just, bounce with this
Okay, this is how it goes, pimpin all you, hoes
Catch em outside the shows, time to get the dough
Up in the studio, smokin the hydro
Writin the hot shit, you waitin for me to go
Threw on the Ram' bounce, just shakin yo' ass yo
Bump this in your Lex Coupe or your Expo'
Flipmode Squad, we the ones in them videos
Catch us with the fly shit, but you don't hear me doe
Rampage, professional, just move your feet
We bout to make you do the jerk, get out your seats
Seven days a week and we the Squad that don't sleep
Catch me in the street I'm on the midnight creep, so what?


I walk the path, that Allah made, +Smooth+, like Sade
Got pickup tracks -- high-beam with the fog rays
International capital, checks cashed in full
Damage your hood, natural, spend grands for goods
Traditional niggaz know -- scream on these players like
DJ call in some mo', invincible pretty flow
Grammar God, swing like gold from Panama
Twenty-four carat charms, with smooth cuts like Sarah Vaughn
Here we go, here we go -- attitude
spit the vocals hotter than soul food from Baton Rouge
Come, sharp-tongued like Malcolm, on any album
Some got chrome like Sly Stone, what you about son?
Here it is, here it is -- handcraft the raw
Who the boss? Human torch any Fantastic Four
Player, I be a point guard, controllin things
In the 4th quarter, it's all water like holdin springs

Yo,I hit you the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gig playing two point eight
Near studded, jewel flooded, got to love it
First rap cat with an R&B; budget
Everyday on the TV, me and PD
Girls see PD, make their man break the CD
Why ya'll forever rowdy, I'll be outie
Somewhere in Maui, 'til I go back to Cali
Can't understand how he can treat you
The way that he does
Give me the chance to show you baby
You're better off with me
Oh so baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down, I'll always be around
And you should be mine
If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine
Why can't you see you should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you
For the rest of your life
Oh so, baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down I'll always be around
And you should be mine
If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine
Yo, what the deal honey, insecure, feeling funny
I know you're used to dealing with cats with real money
Also know you like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when your lonely on the holidays
When you shop should you shop for two
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back, treat you like you all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbin' all day and all night
Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life
Even though he gave you ice that'll make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
How you give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me
'Cause Mase ain't the player with the PHD
Girl, come into my world
I'll love you the way that you need to be loved
No worries no more, girl open the door
And don't waste your time
'Cause you should be mine
If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine",R&B
"Lost in a full time fantasy
I used to walk around lookin' for someone
Someone, someone will love me
Oh why, I thought that dreams were out of reach for me?
And my heart had seized to beat
Then you came, you came and you touched me
Now I am feelin' my heart beat again
And I feel I could win this time
Falling in love again
And I am feelin' my heart beating so fast
And I feel it could last with you
Falling in love again
Falling in love again
Caught in a mystic reality
That's the way I felt that moment I laid eyes on your soul
And in a while you became the fire
That kissed me warm from the cold
The only one I wanna hold
Can't you see you make love me so much more?
And I am feelin' my heart beat again
Don't have to pretend no more
Falling in love again
And I am feelin' my heart beat so fast
Feel it could last with you
You got me falling in love again
Falling in love again
Right now, right now
I am feelin' my heart beat again

You gotta love ya hood,

About an ounce of bakin soda,

Ya see growin' up I seen a lot a things I weren't supposed,
So growin' up I lost a lot a people that were closer,
That's why I stay up on my grind and only roll with soldiers,
I hit the block and serve em everything away from soda,
Don't fuck with out the soda,
Sellin' coke with out the cola,
My clientele is strictly rock you can tell it by the odor,
I keep that nino with the mac hid underneath the sofa,
So if you ridin' slngin' tricks I suggest a coma,
Them pussy niggas want me dead so I suggest and dopa.

You gotta love ya hood,
You need to love your projects,
Hey get me, get me.
Yeah I wake up in the ghetto tryin' dream a couple mill,
I'm forced to get, momma shootin' up and poppin' pills,
Daddy on the porch with no remorse he sittin' still,
This be the city that never pity they would rather kill,
I wipe my eyes and check my clientele who by yourself,
I grab the pots and bakin' soda yeah that odor smell,
Dis be the hood I got connections like a phone cable,
So watch where you work cause a mistake can be fatal,
Cause crakers searchin' for that person tho I'm under table,
Can't find no witness, fuck them snitches,
That get snitches popped, another day just talkin' on the block,
With a million on my glock, and a half off in my sock.

Travel the world together, you can hold my hand
Crossing cracks from the airplane to the terminal gate
Hope we're meant for each other, hope that love is our fate

Can't steady the current no matter how hard I try
We could all use an anchor, you're not afraid of the sea
Let's both dive in together, put your hooks in me
Boy, you really got me after birthday cake
Making out on my friend's new couch
So call me any night, any day of the week

And I know I'm far away but this is just the start
And if we make it past the first little part
We could fly around the world in the very same plane
We could share a life, share a name

I hope you'll come around soon
My apartment is tiny
But I think there's enough room for you
Yeah, boy you really got me after birthday cake
Making love on my friend's spare bed
And I can't seem to shake walking Echo Park Lake
Or get your face out of my head

Well my only confidant is this empty room
And my only response is the echo in my voice
When I'm falling in love it's like I have no choice
From my heart to my throat to my lips to the air
I don't wish for much, but I wish you were here
We need to check this out
Oh, check me in
I'm not into playing games but I do fight to win

If you're lucky, you can run and keep on breathin'
When my knife hit ya windpipe and you start wheezin'
You put your hand over the hole and it gonna stop the breathin'

Trust me, I'm not what you used to homie
You little fagot, I'll tell ya fuckin' boss to blow me

"He's coming on the clouds
Kings and kingdoms will bow down
Every chain will break

And fighting our battles
Every knee will bow before Him
Our God is a lamb
The lamb that was slain
For the sins of the world

Oh yes I'm new and improved, and to a funky-ass groove
My name is Quik and I'm smooth, and I'm making yo' ugly bitch move
With the streets you can't lose, but if you still want to choose
To be a sucker, I got a 380 punk, so duck her
And to you motherfuckers thinking you want to fade me?
I'm running the underground, so fool, you're crazy
And you better step, 'fore I beat you with a switch
And tie you up, and make you watch, while I'm fucking yo' bitch
Cause I'm a low-pro nigga that you should not fol-low
Putting suckers in the wind cause my voice is hollow
Put the pistol to your grill and your punk ass rolls
You grab my shit and I pull the trigger now you're missing a nose
And umm, I don't fear your crew because my back is got
Chasing nothing but the suckers when we hit yo' spot
Yeah, straight Bronx killer, mark ass niggas can't check me
But gotta respect me, cause I'm Way 2 Fonky

Fonky, yeah, fonky, ""you know I can't stop""
Fonky, yeah, fonky, ""you know I can't stop""
Fonky, yeah, fonky, ""you know I can't stop""
Fonky, yeah, fonky, yeah

Now no sooner than I hit the fucking streets
People be approaching me, all throughout the swap meets
Asking me shit like, ""When your new album coming out?""
""Is it different?"" ""Is it dope?"" ""Where yo' perm?""
What you talking bout?
I know you don't expect that a nigga gon' quit
Being nothing less than funky and banging out the dope-ass hits
Cause DJ Quik is a name that I take much much pride in
No egoes to hide in and no limos to ride in
Maybe a Cutlass or two, but still the same ol' shit
And me unclever? No never, I'll have this talent forever
The producer get funky down to the last ounce
And I'm creative too, so I don't need ""Mo' Bounce""
But to you suckers in my city claiming I got a ""Def Wish""
You should try again fool, you ain't hitting near this
Them wack ass tracks, make you sound like a monkey
Just a shot in the dark, from a punk-ass mark who ain't Fonky


Now when you records ain't that funky then it's easy to disrespect this
Cause you know that when I hit I didn't miss
Just like that ""I'm Born and Raised,"" you wish you could fade
And when you picked up that album cover you knew I was paid, Tim
Cause we ain't going out and we ain't stuck in that old school shit
That boring flavor that just don't hit
Cause this is ninety-two, and yes yo' style is through
And if your record ain't selling well fool I thought you knew
That this is straight Bronx killer, straight Bronx murder
Yeah yo' city's a dump, and fool yo' shit don't bump
And 'member the ""Jack the Rapper""? Yeah, your punk ass sat
That's when my homeboy D, was bout to flatten yo' cap
And you apologized to him, started kissing his ass
Saying you only dissed Compton for the money, so he gave you a pass
But you ain't moving shit on the streets
Get off the nuts of my city with them wack ass beats that ain't Fonky

I saw you at one of our shows
you were different then any other girl
I think it was the way you smiled
when I sang or announced the song title
thoughts were spinning in my head
you and me, deep wishes, and denial
And I don't know why
why you looked at me
I thought you were thinking the same as me
when our set was done, I went to find my true love
But you were with the singer of the other band
If I could only talk to you
But that guy sat next to you
I'd give the world for just one kiss
Maybe I should kick his ass
Or send a mailbomb to his address
Even though you parents wouldn't let you date a guy in prison
And I don't know why
why you looked at me

I saw you kiss his cheek

Ladies follow me now...
Damn..my..my batteries low? 

See I don't fuss and fight, if he ain't acting right, I just tell him

See I don't bust or spit, if he ain't home yet, you better tell him

See I don't give a fuck, if he packin' stuff, just let him go and say

See I'ma be alright, on the lonely nights, you don't believe me say


Now ladies, listen closely to the shit I'm bout to share with you
See, I'ma show you what it take to get the perfect screw
Since, ain't nobody speakin' on it, I'ma be the first to say it
And let these niggaz know, they sex is highly overrated
I ain't never been the type, to sit and wait on some nigga
Especially, when I know I can make me cum quicker
No, I ain't really interested in how much you packin'
Cause, I got something that can guarantee me satisfaction
And see my tatics, safer than using some pro-ka-lactic
Safer than using any other code of action, really though
Don't get it twisted, tryin' to think I'm on some right shit
The right dick can turn me on, faster than a light switch
Guess I got a fascination when it comes to masturbation
Nothing like the sensation, penetratin', got me shakin'
Now I caught the midas touch, give me the slightest rush
Something bout it makes me blush, the only one I trust


Now here's something that women do
That I just can't see to phatom, now why the fuck
We walkin' round faking orgasms
Ain't nobody speaking on it, ima be the first to say it
And let these niggaz know they sex is highly overrated
I ain't never been the type to waste my time with amateurs
Cause ain't nothing worser than a nigga with no stamina
And then got the nerve to go and run and tell your home boys
Well, did you tell them, I had to cum off my own toys?
Know a lot of niggaz, gon get mad and say I'm male-bashing
And yeah I know they probably hate this song with a passion
Instead of attitude, you should be showing gratitude
Tryin' to show you little dudes, an avenue you never knew
A lot of ladies walk around frustrated sexually
When it comes to fixin', they don't know how easy that could be
Follow my instructions carefully
I promise you for surely guarantee
That it will make you come faster than a speeding bullet

Would blow your heart away

Don't be a number 'cause I know that I'm gonna have me some fun

Don't be a sucker 'cause I know that I'm gonna have me some fun
Gotta stick to your guns

Feeling of feeling
I used to fill the sky around
With happiness and joy
I had news to give the wind
To keep my sails and heart employed
I felt people move around me
I felt loneliness and shame
Back then everyday was different
Now each moment is the same
I miss it

I miss that feeling of feeling
I miss it

The feeling of feeling
The wind upon my face
And caring what it brings this way
The feeling of feeling
The minutes pass away
And caring what I do with them
Maybe bring me life or something else, oh
And so it goes a man grows cold
Some would say a man grows strong
They say life only grows short
I say the road only grows long
As long as there's a road
My feet will never touch the ground
If you won't give my heart back
I've no need to stick around

"She came on to him like a slow moving cold front
His beer was warmer that the look in her eye
She sat on the stool, and she said ""What do you want
She said Give me a love that don't freeze up inside
He said, I have melted some hearts in my time dear
But to sit next to you Lord I shiver and shake
And if I knew love, well I don't think I'd be here
Askin' myself if I had what it takes
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
These days we all play cool calm and collected
Our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze
But under the frost, wee thought he detected
A warm blush of red, and the touch of her knee
He said you're a beauty like I've never witnessed
And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air
I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss
And there's not enough heat in the fires burning there
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
To melt your icy blue heart",Country

"Hello, Here we are. Hanging on.
For once in a lifetime, for once I'd like to live it large.
Came a long way from the days of the garage.
Took it to the stage, paid our way to the stars.
Got a one time shot, two times at the top.
I might have lost the battle but, at least I came and fought
Started with the baby steps, grew into a giant.
Fe Fi Fo Fum, we out to start a riot.
Be happy this is what you got, when your living like a one life lot.
And your scheming on a one time shot.
Well I know .. I'm gonna make it!
Don't give up the fight, baby I know, I'm gonna make it.
Fight with all your might, honey I know, I'm gonna be alright.!
Eve'r since I was four, yea I knew for sure that I'd being doing a little something like thiiissss
And I gotta let you know, eve'r since we rip the show
yeah i knew we can make it real biiigggg.
Cause I wanna big time spot, with a big time slot, and a big man saying heres your one time shot.
With a big time show, a little big time dough. and for sure
You know we ain't never gonna stop.
Damn sure we ain't ever gonna quit.
Grabbing hard, and hustling hits.
Damn sure we ain't ever gonna miss,
Be happy this is what you got, when your living like a one life lot.
And your scheming on a one time shot.
Well I know I'm gonna make it!
Don't give up the fight, baby I know, I'm gonna make it.!
Fight with all your might, honey I know, I'm gonna be alright.!
Yeah I don't know, and I don't care.
Some people keep coming with a cold stares.
But I'ma keep on pushing like some glaciers
To be a big time mill like im 
And if you see me at the beach, you know i'll be alright.
But if I'm in too deep, would you save my live?
I got no time to fight, I gotta pound the mic.
We getting signed, Im hyped !
Yeah how does it sound? Alright?
Don't give up the fight, baby I know, I'm gonna make it.
Fight with all your might, honey I know, I'm gonna be alright.!
Don't give up the fight, baby I know, I'm gonna make it.

And beddybye your them Harrington riches and varmen rifles screws

Always pay attention to your warning signs
Always be awoke, always be aware, always look over ya shoulder
Always be alert of the rollers

In ya scraper, feeling ya paper rubbing Donny Taylor or Clarence Carter
A lot smarter than the average Joe
Straight out the ghetto they call me E-40
Still hungry, still rapping like I'm still 'spose
Still money, still money on my mind folks

Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more I`ll share
Now he's gone, I`m alone

I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him, watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly, destiny, misery
Tragedy on our last date
Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my baby`s eye
Walked away, didn't know
That I`d soon miss him so

We'd race our bikes to school and Paul would always win

I flew up to Tennessee to visit him once more
It didn't shock me, none to hear that he'd been brave
He'd lost his own life but another one was saved
I waited by a tree till everyone had left
I went up and said a prayer where my pal slept
And then I heard a voice I hadn't heard in years
I didn't need to turn around I knew just who was there

pillows of liquid and clear eyes
shining intense mirrors
of green silvery recesses,
tangled gardens,
emerald water-works,
old crumbled balaustrades

fresco in the wind
spiritual thrills of bluish-green contrasts.
My liquid and clear eyes
grasp and welcome
the bright run-after

When the full moon lights cemetery's valley
Winds of frost strike my tomb
When I am in eternal sleep
When wild storms dwell
Wind blows through the Baltic
Instincts unleash the war inside
And strike the sky with Holocaust thunder
Mountains sleep, the forest
Covers freezing land where I was born
Now I walk among the castles
Watch the streams of frozen tears
Spilled with blood of forefathers
Night breeze feed my spiritual form
And spirits gather, floating in the mist
My eastern empires spread wings of winter
Visions of destruction's ruin and tragedies
Tasting pure sin, fade into the pit
And walk through my beloved, endless woods
I summon all the beauty Evil
To rape the bodies of your disciples
Too long I hide in shades of woods
And now I build my beauty Hall

"On doorsteps and in alleyways
I see these fools passed out
At any time of the day
Crashed out in a bed of piss
Empty bottle cradled in their arms.
So tell me
Who's job is it to tend these few people?
Back to self-sufficiency and respect
I turn my head it puts chills in my heart
If I give you some change to clear my mind
Would I have played my part?
There's a man who has a dream
But never seems to make it
'Cause everytime he gets some, someone tries to take it.
A second chance at life, no one will give him
In an alley wat is where he's livin'
You see him there you walk by laughing and smirking
Thinking to yourself it's only his fault, he ain't working.
That might be true but it's only half the story so
Kick back while we tell you his story.
He came back from the war a veteran
The only thing he learned to do was kill and shoot a gun.
That comes in handy when you're fighting a war
But when you came back to society you need much more.
So all he had was terror in his mind
No job skills so a job he couldn't find.
The only thing he had was memories
Of his friends being killed and crying and dying babies.
So he grabbled bottle for an escape
From all the mental torment that the war had made.
Now you're calling him a bum 'cause he can't get none
While you're sitting at home not willing to get some.
Sharing and caring is what he needs now
Some support for his marals, some help for his ego.
So he can go to the top where every man can
And all he really needs is a helping hand.
So tell me
Who's job is it to tend these few people?
Back to self-sufficiency and respect
I turn my head it puts chills in my heart
If I give you some change to clear my mind
Would I have played my part?

We find reason why we shouldn't go our separate ways

Do I just sit and let you go
Or do I call out for you

With me and I've had days I wanted to leave
But to think about one day or one night without you
Baby it's the fear of losing love
The kind of love that you need so much
I know you will be alright, you'll be fine
Get a new man someone who helps you live all your fantasies
But girl I don't it's me
Before you go can I hold you
Wipe away your tears, console you
Make you know that my love was true
It's so hard baby saying goodbye to you

How could you just look me in the eye
Forgetting about all the things that were right
How could you just let me go when you know

All of the promises we made
The good and the bad, we vowed that we'd stay
You would have known that I didn't want to go

"They burst through the gates
With swords in hand they made their way
Cross the hall of the high lord.
As long as that man lives
Peace will never propagate
Between me and my brothers here
So yield yourself to your fate!

Grey in face and without will
Not knowing wrong from right.
You have brought shame and disgrace
To soil your fathers' name
And heaven will not easily
Forget the game you've played.

He was bound to a horse then they rode away
Through a cold winter storm.
Travelling night and day
Through a kingdom of snow
And finally arriving at
The castle of his foes.
He was shackled to the wall,
In the tower high above the ground

And makes us wish we'd shown respect before
Though I don't have much of a choice
I resolve to regain my voice

If I only just begin to understand it that's because
Everytime I time I start to change my mind again
It gets me back to where I was
New life we never had a clue
The two of us deciding what to do
Though my hands are all but tied
I rebound so I can say at least I tried

"Here we are, far beyond the distant sky
Seen all the world and how the story will be over
Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed
Now we have found the light that guides us over
Through the falling rain we travelled far and wide
And through the blackest darkness, stars above shining bright
Through the sun and winter rain will fall
All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call
We're walking hand in hand in dreams of endless time
How do we know when we will leave this life behind?
Stare at life through eyes of mine
The hate, the fear and the pain
There's a feeling held deep inside
When life you live is in vain
Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close our eyes to see the light of brigther days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal
With the trail of broken hearts flying free
Once again we walk this lonley road
There are times that we were wading through the rain and cold
We're lost in memories of what we left behind
Relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside
Lives are filled with emptiness
The fear returns once again
Searching endlessly, now we will see
Drown your mind in the pain
Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close our eyes to see the light of brigther days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal
With the trail of broken hearts flying free
The last temptation will be all that's left for me
When I see those tears you cried
When I hear those lies you lied
When I feel all creation now falling down on me
Is this the reason to be?
Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close our eyes to see the light of brighter days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal

Slash the lips that were once longed to be kissed

Promise to keep her digging deeper
One strong smile reminds looks can deceive
If you're strong enough to bleed
You're strong enough to leave
Running away again down the same short hall
The face she used to have stares from these walls
Burn the rope while tying up loose ends
Introduced to the family secret again

And I'm right by you
 I'm drowned in love feels like your touch just makes me whole
You're like a secret language and you speak unto my heart's home

I'll have his wine and spit it right back out
Somewhere I grew legs
There's a wall out past the shallow waters
Where's there's god and all his faithful
Followers, they remained, endured the taste of salt
There's a beast who swallowed up his soldiers
Drew them out into the cities and shores
Gave them greed and made them slaves...

"In dreams I appear and take her
Down a path she dares not wander
In a town beset by plunder
I shake her blood and bone
In dreams she asks my guidance
How to live in holy silence
Beyond the anger of her father
Enrich her mind and soul
Hold me inside all the night
Your leaders your baby
Hold me inside all the night
Your teacher loves you crazy
In dreams she feels me beside her
As I stoke her female fire
In a world that feels so lonely
I fill her need and hope
In dreams I appear and take her
On wings of heavens power
Beyond tears that stain her pillow
She takes my love and poem.
Hold me inside all the night
Your leaders your baby
Hold me inside all the night
Your teacher loves you crazy
Hold me",Folk
"The sun maybe shining sunny and bright
But my world is black like the the darkness of the night
For me the stars up above refuse to shine
Since I lost that precious baby of mine
Since I lost that precious baby of mine
The month of May, may bring blossoms to the trees
But all of this beauty I'm much to blind to see
Take away my sight it's no good to me
'Cause loneliness is my destiny
Lonely loneliness is my destiny
And I feel like crying, crying
Almost dying, dying, dying, dying
She left me in a world of darkness, darkness
When she took her sweet love away from me, oh yeah
She took her sweet love away from me
I walk the street at night with no destination
Since she been gone I have no inspiration
When I stop to see just what she's done to me
I see tear stained eyes, cloudy skies
I'm lonely man, just a half of man that needs his baby
So I feel like crying, crying
Feel like dying, dying, dying, dying, dying
The girl she left me in a state of confusion and darkness
When she took her sweet love away from me, oh yeah
Why did you take your sweet love away from me
Ooh why did you take it, baby?
In my heart I'm crying, sometimes I feel like dying, dying, dying, dying
She left me I a state of confusion and darkness
Girl, why, why, why did you take your love?
Oh baby, why did you take your love away from me?
I'm a world of darkness, can't see no light
No satisfaction, baby, nowhere in sight
I'm a lonely man
Just a half a man
That needs his baby
And I feel like crying
I'm in a world of darkness
I'm all alone, baby
Once she took her love
Why you take your love?
Why you take your love, baby, away from me?
I fell like crying in the morning
Crying in the evening
Oh baby, feel like dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying
You left me in a world of confusion and darkness
Why did you take it baby?
Why did you take your love away from me?
Why did you take your sweet love away from me?
I'm crying, I feel like dying
I'm crying, in a world of darkness
I'm crying, can't see no light
I'm crying, no satisfaction in sight
I'm crying, oh baby, I feel like dying
Lord have mercy, I feel like crying, crying, crying, crying
She left me in a world, in a world of confusion

We winnin, I ran a million yards

We winnin, it ain't about to slow down

My imperfections away
And I would stand
Stand by your side until the sun turns the sky
All the colors I see in your eyes
I'll never need to see the sun again
There's enough light in your eyes to light up our little world
So take me, take my away
Kill me slowly, I'll never be the same

And I dedicare to you all that I have
And I promise you that I will stand right by your side

I never drink and drive
''cause I might spill my drink

Give me the keys, I'm OK
Quit tellin' me I'm drunk, I only had five Hurricanes
Quit bein' such a Puritan, I'm a mega-turrican 
Wakin' up and it's all a blur again
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm still alive...
Red Skull more like skull and crossbones
Took my driver's test straight pilin' over the cones
It ain't funny so don't you dare chuckle
Drivin' hella drunk without my beltbuckle
Fuck you, I'm OK
That's what they all say
Already got a suspended license
Smokin' weed in my ride and lightin' incense
Not knowin' it could be gone in an instant
Pistons pumpin', slumpin'
Over the steering wheel
So many drunk drivers on the road
It's killing fields
Who gives a fuck?
If I get caught all I get
Is a slap on the wrist
My license tooken is a bitch
But I still drive with a D.U.I.
Crash, see my passenger fly
Through the windshield
It's hard to see you die
Heads crushed, necks severed from the shards
That's what happens playing with a wild card
How do you feel on trial for killin' your girl?
Nineteen years old, the end of the world
Don't know what to do
Pop's is gonna' kill you
Twelve gauge shotgun to your grill smooth
Got you in a predicament
If I'm drivin' drunk I've got a sickness
Some fool's is shiftless
Like me, gifted
Student GPA: four point oh
Blood alcohol level past that though

I never drink and drive
''cause I might spill my drink

Three o'clock, time to go
One more line of coke with cognac
But my cognitive skills ain't on the shit
What now Sherlock?
Key to the lock
My friend's is tellin' me to stop
Damn near down the block
I found cops in the bushes peekin'
Plus it's the weekend and I'm off the deep end
I roll through an alley way, can't see
Getting ansy I hop on the interstate but it's late
Cops patrol but I don't give a fuck though
I swerve to the right and get stuck in a mudhole
Check the rearview, the coast is clear
Tryin' to focus here but I can't
Drunk as hell, bust a rail
Now I'm sailin' off the cliff
High off the spliff, plus a fifth
I bust my shit
Now I'm rollin' down the side like a suicide
What will my family do if I die?
Tension builds, I went through hills and trees
Stopped by a redwood first thing broke was knees
I feel pain then a split second later
Car burst into flames, they won't know my name
They'll have to check my dental records
My body is charred
Burnt to a crisp soon as the car flipped the crash
That's my ass, a thing of the past
Already dead by the impact of airbags

I never drink and drive
''cause I might spill my drink
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive, If I'm still alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive, If I'm still alive...

Could you love me the rest of my life?
Could you forever be the one for me this time?

How can I ever know if you feel the same?
Are you the sunshine that's begging me
To come in from the rain
Or have you come into my life
To turn around and take your love away?
Could you be the one for me?
Could we dance the night away?

Though I don't have much

Could you love me the rest of my life?
Could you forever be the one for me this time?

What do you expect
When some ole trucker's heart gets broke
Yeah, a trucker's heart gets broke
But them big wheels of rubber
Gonna rub her off my mind
Well I'm a highway junkie
And I need that old white line
Ten miles outta' Nashville
I was doin' a hundred and one
State boy pulled me over
He said ""Where's the fire son?""
Said ""Where's the fire son?""
I said man there ain't no fire
I'm just runnin' from a flame
So go on an write your ticket, man,
But I aint the one to blame
That county judge tried to rob me blind
But them big wheels of rubber
Gonna rub her off my mind
Well I'm a highway junkie
And I need that old white line

So I rolled on down to Memphis,
I had nothin' left to loose
Wanted to hear some rock n' roll
But all they played was blues
I didn't wanna hear no blues
So I went to call up Elvis
But Roger Miller grabbed the phone
He said drive that eighteen wheeler boy
You're the king of the road
Said I was the king of the road
But them big wheels of rubber
Gonna rub her off my mind
Well I'm a highway junkie
And I need that old white line
I said I'm a highway junkie, man,
And I need that old white line...",Country
"A veces las cosas se tuercen te digo por cierto

Why nos den mas que cero

Thy hanged him on on his throne
And nailed him in the ground
The prophet, he upon the tree,
Sacrificed himself for the whole world to see
He bled for you, he bled for me

It was a day, forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still
It was for real
Upon the hill
The Savior gave his life
So you and I might live
He had to die
To pay redemption's price
It was the only day the angels ever cried
He died for you, he died for me
The lonely road on his way to Calvary
It was the day, forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still
Then came Sunday morning
The angels sang and the stone it rolled away
It was the day, forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still

housed in empty contraband

when we're only out at night
in some overcrowded room
waiting for our time to lose
While on the make
our new favorite lost his grip and fell from grace
as some brand new king came creeping toward the alter
we kept safe, we just gave up
chalk one up for our good taste

And the beach is white as snow
And everyone's got money
And no place to go
In a land of milk and honey
It can really make you smile
And if I had a ticket
I would stay in biscuit city for a while

All the boys are in the buff
With the baby in between and
That makes three of us
And the streets are all so quiet
And the walls are squeaky clean

The town of biscuit city you have seen
I'd rather be in biscuit city
With my banjo in my hand
Than take a big vacation
In some foreign land

"Down to the feline den I crawl
to join the feline force that waits
I strike a sort of katsy stance
as they look into my cat-like face
From behind their sable masks
Not a purring sound is heard
Their luminous eyes catch my every word;
Tonight's the night the tables turn
You've had your chance and now at last
You've been found guilty by the order of the cat
You've changed our laws and now because of that
Your going to live in the claws of a cat
Talons on and operating
We're sure that you're cooperating
Straighten up that feline face
And put your footsie pads in place
Practice up your katsy glance
And imitate my cat like stance
Tonight's the night the cats return
We'll corner them by the alley wall
Bite and scratch them until they fall
Lap their blood and steel their young
Finish them off just for fun
Tonight's the night the cats will run
Mommy I hear the cat at the door
I think he's cold will you let him in?
Lay them out and leave our mark
A cat scratch angle above the heart
On we'll go to another house
To play the game of cat and mouse
Why do you plead when we don't care?
We're the cats and we don't scare
You've had your turn and now it's ours
We're the cats and we've got claws",R&B

The world is turning, turning, turning
Day breaks
On a world that is waiting
Lighting up the broken stones of time
It stretches like a shattered road to Eden
Where love is standing flashing like a sign
In the cobalt blue of television
We make love turn off the world it's turnin' round
It maybe gravity that holds you while it's spinnin'
But only love
Can keep your feet on the ground
Somewhere east of Eden's gate
We ran a light at love and hate
It's tired and we're getting late
The wheels are spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning
Somewhere east of Eden's gate
We ran a light at love and hate
It's tired and we're getting late
The wheels are turning, turning, turning
Night dreams through a moon age darkly
That the breath of something powerful is near
And it travels up the shattered road to Eden
Breaking down the barrier of the fear
It stimulates the space that lies between us
Our two spirits through the senses of touch and feel
It maybe sanity that tells us what we're feeling
But only love
Can tell us what is real
Somewhere east of Eden's gate
We ran a light at love and hate
It's tired and we're getting late
The wheels are spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning
Somewhere east of Eden's gate
We ran a light at love and hate
It's tired and we're getting late
The wheels are spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning
It's not too late
OooooOoooo
East of Eden's gate
When ran a light at love and hate
It's tired and we're getting late
The world is spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning
Somewhere east of Eden's gate
We ran a light at love and hate
It's tired and we're getting late
The wheels are spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning
Somewhere east of Eden's gate
We ran a light at love and hate
It's tired and we're getting late
The wheels are spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning

"When I was young I did questionable things
My parents and teachers
thaught me quite insane
My priest kneeled me down
and asked me to repent
I said fucker get back
I aint even half bent
They junkyards my playground
I laugh as fools go to church
My parents threw me out cause
I was the Devils work
They singled me out like they once did to Christ
I said if religions so great
Why does it come with a price
They sent me to hell C.O.D.
They sent me to hell cash on delivery
They Sent me to hell C.O.D.
Into the devils arms he was waiting for me
Now I'm an adult it's a new different game
You'll die fast without power or fame
I go in a bar, all the heads turn to look
The regular boys say I came out of a book
The jocks and the rednecks
They just don't understand
Why I won't pay the price
To be in the promised land
The mothers they don't want
Their children near me
So they'll never copy the behavior they see
Now i'm down there looking up Kathys skirt
Trying to grab some nookie
But my fingers get burnt
I run in circles looking for a way out
The devil laughs and turns me into a trout
I look in the mirror and to my suprise
On Tom's forehead is stamped
My utlimate demise
They got me wrapped up
In yesterdays news
I looked down and read how I killed all the jews",Rock
"It keeps raining and raining
Tears from my eyes
Since you gone
All I do is cry
Won't somebody help me?
Somebody help me?
Can't you see
That my baby done left me?
She left me reeling and rocking
Walking the floor
She left a note last night
She won't be back no more
It keeps raining and raining
Tears from my eyes
Since you gone
All I do is cry
Won't somebody help me?
Somebody help me?
Can't you see
That my baby done left me

Walking the floor

She won't be back no more",R&B
"Who's in a bad mood, who's in a taxi?
Turning the clock back, avoiding a fight with this man he is meeting
Stands in the lobby, counting his questions in the neon light
Sinking under the river, sewer line touches the edge of the suburbs
Back to the beach where a family is waiting on rumors of summer
Lay out a blanket, bring something to feed the birds
With all the luck you've had
Why are your songs so sad?
Sing from a book you're reading in bed
And took to heart
All of your lives unled, reading in bed",Rock

Yeah, the one that laughed at me when I told 'em God was sendin' me a boat, but then he cried when DJ Quik came
A day in the life of a playa name Free
When John Mayer told the world he didn't CARE for me
But look at Obama in the office for the get back, mayne
I believe in takin', go to school and GET that game
Dark brown Cognac to the head
You can't tell me shit, nigga Michael Jackson dead
I only shed my tears when I'm listenin' to ""Off the Wall""
That medicine didn't kill 'em -- y'all did cause y'all talked about him like a dog
No, I ain't pickin' up no girl for no security, Jack
Didn't Paris Hilton finally get her jewelry back?
And Tiger Woods needs some back-up
Boy, don't you ever apologize to no prostitute, now hit the green and tee THAT up
But let a mack get 'er;
'member that sex scene on ""Baby Boy""? I woulda fucked them hoes just like Jack
Now I'mma kiss the ground like a 747 stack
Cause success is the greatest revenge, but it's gon' back

Yeah, Suga Free the P, man
Pomona style, man have them niggas crackin' up
I don't drink alcohol, but when I do drink I prefer Dos Equis
I don't need nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't care about nobody, I just care about me
Now my life, is backstage, wristbands, flashlights
Then, do the same thing we did last night - Jam
I'm retro Nickelodeon, I'm still all that
I even rock Jermaine just like Mike Jack
Addicted to the night life just like crack
But in the black Mercedes with the ladies in the back
I like to make you brick, it's what makes me tick
The way the team decided by just one kick
Now do the grand slam, damn
Take you back so far, I got you flyin' Pan Am
I get the club packed tight like canned ham
Sealin' all your artists, now pass your exam
Or get down or gon' get it knit up
I got a Quincy Jones in my bones, genes split-up
DJ Quiksta in the center like a pent-up
And I don't break down - I been up
I don't care about nobody, that don't care about me",Hip-Hop
"Each night I leave the bar room when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
I couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind
Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down
I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an ol' familiar way
Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down

About the bad ass Eazy-E
He was drinkin' whisky and gin at the age of three
Listen and listen well, he's a bad muthafucka
Gimme that goddamn book
Here let me read you this one, Christmas in Compton
It was a silent night, yes, a holy night
Until Mr. Claus turned into Santa muthafuckin', right?
Deck the halls with balls of holy
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Merry Christmas, muthafucka
Merry muthafuckin' Christmas and a ho, ho, ho
While I'm ridin' that cot under the missile toe
Now dashin' through the snow
In a candy right top 6-4, over the hills I go
Laughin' at this hoe, nuts on rich and rings
Makin' me feel right, oh, what fun it is to know
That I'm gonna get this pussy tonight
So ring them bells, ring them bells
She's takin' it all the way, oh what fun it is
To watch her suck my dick this way
Hey, ring them bells, ring them bells
Shes takin' it all the way, oh, what fun it is to nut
While she's suckin' my dick, oh, yay
'Tis the season to get busy, Compton crime lick
And I'm smokin' on this stick
Ho, ho, ho, come sit on my face
I'm mean lap and tell me
What you want for Christmas, ho, ho
I want a slay ride, a CD player
A fifty rum,  and I'm gonna cum
A VCR  some porno flicks

Crack a dough by the nuts, oh

I made him drop to his knees
Yeah, you know what's up
I said here's some candy canes, eat 'em up
 bonapatite with a condom in a tree
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth, my two front teeth
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
Yo, where's ya rhyme, tell me Buck Wheat
Buck Wheat is a waskal, that's no Christmas
And all the toys, boys and girls, fuck ya wishes
I got happy over joy in this muthafucka
No indo under my tree, so Santa be a sucka
 when I was young, I was the only kid
Who had enough guts to be good ole hearin' on the East
I'd stay awake just to let America know
That Santa was a fake
I used to believe in Saint Dick when Elvis was alive
But all the fuckin' bullshit got played when I was five
Years, oh, just stay young, bold datin'
Singin' 'Silent Night' Carolin' recitin'
Now all I want for Christmas is my indo wreath
I got my two front teeth, uncle Eazy be the 
Just spread me a leaf, little kids don't cry
When you find out the Santa Claus is just a fuckin' lie
On the third day of Christmas
My homeboys gave to me three pounds of indo
Two birds of cocaine
And a muthafuckin' K bitch
Eazy-E, oh, Eazy-E
Show us how you treat those bitches
I saw mommy fuckin' Eazy-E
Close the door little bitch

Shut the fuck up, bitches
And go back to sleep
Yo, black, what you want for Christmas?
Yo, black I want a job  corn on the cob
But a nigga will eat them chicken
And chitlens, watermelon, corn bread and some food
Whos climbin' in my window, smokin' up indo

And she wouldn? t let me hold her

Something strange got into her last night.

Lord we sure do need to talk
But I guess I? ll just stop at noon
And maybe call her on the phone

To just let her sleep and rest
But it? s killing me wondering
If I? ve done something wrong.

"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
And thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men.
And in despair I bowed my head
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.""",Folk

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms
Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink
I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me
I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I",Pop
"Now that San Francisco's gone
I guess I'll just pack it in
Wanna wash away my sins
In the presence of my friends
You and I, we head back east
To find a town where we can live
Even in the half light
We can see that something's gotta give
When we watched the markets crash
The promises we made were torn
And my parents sent for me
From out west where I was born
Some people say
We've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost for what we've lost
Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life
Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild, woo!
Though we knew this day would come
Still it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born
I now see through a dead man's eyes
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.

Always tried so hard to leave a tragic story
It's tearing me apart you never really care
Never met with your approval from your higher category
Found life at killing pace and wanna have my share

So I'm not gonna dry out draining

King of the mountain
Devil has taken my reason
I got spooks in the attic
We dance on the mountain
And pleasure replacing my reason
Got spooks in the attic
I'm a family kind of man I've lately started number ten
Too alien to find somebody home
Hyper salivation - hyper ventilation
Heading for the grail across the sea of lubrication
I'm out for it while rather on my own

And I even beg or steal if you wanted me to

A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what

I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends

I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get

He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out

"Er is een engel uit de hemel weggevlogen

toen ze alles had gedaan om weg te mogen
kwam ze met zachte landing in m'n warme bed terecht

en in haar ogen staat een grote regenboog
er is iets hemels in haar aardse lijf verscholen
ook al zie je dat niet met het blote oog
Zij is niet van deze wereld
zij is niet van deze tijd
want ze tovert met haar handen

en het lijkt als zij me aanraakt

Er is een engel uit de hemel weggeslopen
en nu ligt ze hier verlegen en verdwaald
heel voorzichtig gaan haar mooie ogen open
en wat ik daar in kan lezen blijft voorlopig onvertaald
Maar ze streelt me met haar zachte lieve handen
en dat vind ik voor het ogenblik genoeg
wat een geluk dat ze nou net naast mij wou landen
ik heb met haar een zalig leven voor de boeg
Zij is niet van deze wereld
zij is niet van deze tijd
want ze tovert met haar handen
maakt de nacht een eeuwigheid

Gotta check myself or let that alcohol be the reason
So I just poor a little liquor on the concrete
For my dead homies and the ones who ain't gone see the streets
Locked up with the rest of the locs
But whatever the reason my folks are walkin the yard
Or gettin they guts some
Tryin to make it home but I think they
Safer in that pin cause niggas on gin be lettin them Mack 10's
Bust 32 times
And niggas who ain't in it gettin shot by
Standards on the block
Smokin like bomb
Fools given up they cell
Gettin sideways leaven them t-shirts soakin wet
Retaliation is a must
So now you know them niggas you was funkin wit
Gone be at yo do so
Keep yo hand on yo nina in the valley

Walked in the party 10 deep and only left wit one
Real nigga on your team
But you know how it is
Can't even trust them niggas that you knew since you was kids
It ain't no thang
I let them niggas have it to
Bitch up and I switch up on that ass before I blast you
And fools better watch them hoes in they mix
Seen them chosen and you bid on that set up for a six
foot ditch with your family in front of you
So many niggas slip
That's how they slide a bitch up under you
I wonder whose the next nigga
To catch a bullet for sex nigga
Thought you was cock until they chopped you with them tecs nigga
I think the game is on its last leg
Trigga happy niggas wit no heart
It ain't no used to be
For your life

Snortin that Peruvian
On Hennessey you know they gone
can't tell a nigga shit in the 9-5
All about they scrilla doin niggas in on the side
Bellin through yo hood buckin fools down
Gettin caught slippin with they mutherfuckin pants down
Sleep with one eye open in the valley
cause everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali



California niggas be plottin on fools
Jackin mutherfuckers for them daytons
And leave that ol' school
Sittin on with yo face in the dash
two in the back of yo head
Rip yo pockets of then laugh
Then you got them fools on the track pullin out glocks
Pistol whippin niggas till they drop
Reach in they draws and take they rocks
They money
They rings and they chains
Without a skimask on
But can't complain
Its all in the game
Follow one of them ballers to they residence
tyin niggas up
Lookin for them dead presidents
Its for the money
You know the scratch but now we call it scrilla
It turned them kali niggas into straight killas
Set trippin on a daily basis
Vietnam ain't shit on what a nigga in the hood faces
1-8-7 case
Cop into a lesser charge
Three strikes
Hit you with that L
Lock behind bars
Bellin wit a strap
Punks seem like its waitin
To catch a nigga slippin or get killed over conversation
Fuckin wit bitch will get you killed quick
Niggas let they hoes mow down they homies on the real beitch
Fools come to kali thinkin club med
Caught up in the cross fire when them sets bump heads
Keep yo hand on ya nina in the valley
Or everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali

She'd love it too

Leave her now
Leave her now
She'll be back online, give a little time
So leave her now
Leave her now
She'll make it through somehow
She'll be back in style with a little smile
But leave her to be
For a while
She reads what everyone has said
And hangs the cards beside the bed
It dulls the ache
She lies awake
At first she cried, but in the end
She knew she'd cope, and she had friends
So she was strong
And life goes on, and on, and on

Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin' tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin' Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she's away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc' backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so

All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I'm a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name but I'mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said ""I'm glad you ate it, where my cap & gown?""
Told her ""I can be your chauffeur,"" dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that's my M.O
Red bone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty

Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven screaming ""Oh, Hell no!""
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favourite restaurant she order for me, cause she know me
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows

Because the weather man said that you have to have one at all times
Because it's going to rain cats and dogs
Uh, welcome back, yeah
One liner flow
See it in my liner notes
The kind of ideas make it seem like the thoughts took 365 nights
I picture the high life
Poolside, made my own terms from lonely nights
?
They say old soul with kids energy
Steals off of my torso with enemies
By any means, I've seen what it's worth
A curse, snakes and centipedes is venomous
Seems the only safe place is Venice Beach
Try to wrong my rights, try to right my wrongs
Try to write my songs
Shine lights but the night is gone
Daybreak becomes the encore
Can't tell the day to stay because I'm on tour
A young kid pumpin' De La Soul
Spit live, you could say loco
16 not a day, no flow
I grew up with nervous skaters
Some headed for greatness
Others served as waiters
Some nameless, others were stars and straps
Ain't famous
Steel that ain't stainless
Hi haters, peace signs, see ya later
Lyin' for no reason
Quit tryin', it's greasy
Easy target, walked up in Florida gators
Origin lost angels, support Lakers
Four finger discount, ? my fortress
Fortress of my get down, live from Belgium stages
LA made him, LA grazed him, then LA saved him
It's back to the beach bitch where Miss Taylor raised him
My momma opposite of Sarah Palin
With no gat, from Russia lookin' back like, quit playin'

Cats were believed to represent the wind

Different animals represented different weather

And make love to all the beautiful ladies
And I'd eat cheeseburgers with bacon and extra grease when I was
hungry
And drink Windex Colladas until my skin turned blue

My lifestyle, it is rearranging
For debauchery may be fun and entertaining
But it is also very bad for you
Do you know how many diseases you can get
Making love to someone who has not had all their tests
So nowadays, I am celibate
And I wear a condom, in case I have dirty thoughts
I never drive my car past the speed limit
And I always wear my seat belt when I am in it
I traded my Lambourghini for a Honda Civic
Because it is more fuel-efficient and practical
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!
Being boring is the way to go!
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!
Having fun is bad for you!
I can no longer smoke my cigarettes
Because I found that they are a major cause of death
The tar and nicotine have not killed me yet
But if I got pregnant, they could hurt my baby
I used to love my swarthy complexion
I tanned myself to perfection
But the sun can give you a cancerous infection
So now I'm white and pasty and I never leave the house
I used to eat like there was no tomorrow
But then I found cholesterol is full of sorrow
The last thing I want to do is to have to borrow
Somebody else's heart, because mine is full of fatty deposits

A road leading into the distance
Space inviting upwards
Anxiety tike on my way
A shadow dismal
Makes me return to the past
From which I'm longing to escape
But there's no sense in escape from myself
Will it last long if I find a new state?
To return to what I've gone through silly
To after myself may be
For everyone you're just
One side of the coin
But nobody sees the reverse
And you're left in private with it
In collision with solitude
Struggle or indifference
In search of yourself
Inside your own senses
The target that makes you live
The meaning & values of your deeds
Who are you for others,
Who are you for yourself?
And the wind anew,
And the road once again
And the brilliant stars
On my night-time way
Wonderful skies in the new space
And there's sense for a while
To escape from myself.",Metal

"A wish so sinful
A sin so tasteful
A taste so painfull
A pain so wishfull
A mind confused
A cry in the dark
A soul seeking shelter
In another torn heart
Words of discourage - struggling for hope
A touch of protection - from a promising hand
Between two worlds - caught in decisions
Visions of freedom - remain as illusions
Invisible ties - a spider's kiss
Perfection of lies - drawn toward the abyss
The look of temptation - the fear of sensation
Imploding desire - feeding the fire
We're band - we're branded
Forever we're stranded
That's what it does to you - the taste of taboo
Upside down it turns you - the taste of taboo
A need so joyfull
A yoy so shamefull
A shame so lustfull
The lust so needfull
Forbidden desires - craving for more
Unknown pleasures - willing to sin for
The lack of perfection - so weak the will
The needed injection - the ultimate thrill
The burning flesh - the sensitive skin
The destroying fire - comes from within
Dangerous games - playing russian roulette
With your life at stake - how far can you get
United in hell - paying the price
Living for sins - dying for vice

Before you decide that you're gonna leave me
And do things you've never done before
Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
The two lips that once held sweet surprises
Surprised me and said goodbye today
And those two lovin' arms that use to reach for me

One kiss roughly expressing all that lips are for
Where do they come from?
Doesn't she speak?
Where can they go from here?
Forever or never
Or once in a while
Their situation's clear
One kiss, never too late to miss
One too many a broken-up affair like this
Spinning together
Drifting away
The song of love is strange
A never ending
See you soon
Too late, the music's changed
One kiss, what kind of end is this?
One more touching impression, one lost love, one kiss
Just as he's trying
To open the door
He fumbles with the key
Clumsily playing for time
Without words
Some things you can only feel
One kiss, lost in shade
One tear, ever so slowly falling left to fade",Rock

Save me please embrace me hold me
Kiss my bleeding soul

You surely wouldn't turn your back on me

You had me there for a while
I was so in love with you
I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee
Boy, I got a wake up call
And it left the message
That you just don't care at all
You can't expect me to
Believe that she doesn't mean anything
You say that you love only me
Your kinda lovin' my darling
I just don't need
HOOK
Then you woulda been sincere
And I wouldn't be in tears
And love woulda brought you
To me last night
Oh baby why
Why do men think that love's just for the moment
Not over time
Please tell me why
Why should I think that
You're gonna be sincere
Are you deservin'
Don't blame me if
I just don't believe
I just don't believe
That you'll always be here

"Years of famine and years of sigh
Reaps our land that fell from crest.
Creatures, serfs and men hanged high
Yet no remedy.

Gather the chiefs and sages.
What will save the tomorrow
From these Dark Ages.
Slay and sacrifice our king,
Coat the statues with noble blood.
Intensify the holy smoke
With a royal lamb.

"
 Are you still here? What are you waiting for?
Your lives to change? An oracle to speak?
Some version of the wounded matador
Who turns toward the bull his other cheek
And entertains you with a torn physique?
Some prisoner in pyjamas dancing lewd
Trablinka waltzes, while another freak
Hangs himself to concentrate your mood
And sweeten up your putrid solitude?
 My drummer is the only one I trust
Let the drums go rolling through the night
And let them pulverise my deep disgust
With steady thunder, whips and dynamite
The man of sticks and skins is always right.
I found him near the cremetorium
Humiliated, begging for a fight.
I wrote the name of honour on a drum
O drummer tell the people why I've come!
O listen to him and his saxophone
 Our musical genital unicorn
 He's very well hung with his golden horn
He'd like to be standing out here alone
The light on his hands, his mouth, and his bone.
 So take your solo now and loose your way
In every fingered hole and brassy groan...
You'll soon begin to choke on what you play
 You're choking now exactly as I say!
 Annointed ones and truely different
Whom orgy doesn't satisfy at all
Who loathe the horizontal argument
 It is to such as you that he was sent.
 I understand the loyalties that insist
You burn a child or shoot a president
Or tattoo numbers on a woman's wrist
I know the sorrow of the good idealist.
It is to such as you that I was sent
To speak directly to your deepest shame
And light the fires of experiment
And burn all hesitation in the flame --
I claim you now, I claim you in the name
Of that which you have never done before
And having done it never be the same.
The victim shall be smitten on his sore.
The haughty one shall have a visitor.
 Your subtle derivation from the beat
 Which I established with an iron fist
A thousand years ago, a small deceit
To be enlarged until you have complete
Control of the mood and the atmosphere --
Your crooked time endangering my defeat --
Now all your instruments must disappear
And on your traitor's face pursue your
dark career!",Rock
"There's a man out there talking speaking in tongues,
losing his hair, bleeding gums,
saying things about my sister, things about their son,

throwing out lines like a submachine,
don't know why or what he really means
because he hasn't been there, and he hasn't ever seen
He says he was a soldier, he told me that he served,
but he never left the barracks only a reserve,
now he making off with another racist word,
I think he lost the war, but won the purge
Take him down some, take him down some,
take him down some, take him down some
Now he's fighting for justice and praying to God,
while he misspells his name and keeps his fingers crossed,
everybody knows God's been dead since 1914,
you can't bridge the gap for the underneath
He has four babies with four different girls,
he has four houses, he has four worlds,
but he has no money
though he's wearing someone's pearls,
and he'll take from your pockets and fumble their curls
In his son I can't see his father's eyes,
because the boy is an angel, the boy doesn't lie,
though he's still one of his lowly four,
his eyes may run, but his blood won't pour
He was bred from the devil, bred just to take,
where they screw up their own in the belly of a lake,
who the hell takes a baby to a dead man's wake,
when the dead man's a racist, the dead man's a snake
I'm gonna wake up in the morning and get myself a gun,
not to fire at anybody just to keep him on the run,
and then drive in the screw and rust it in the sun,
like he did to me, like he does to everyone",Indie

Treated like a criminal but also like a patient

And that side's alive and inside of me
So if you're strong enough, let's push it back in me
Suppress all the pain
Otherwise they'll be another casualty

And I don't even really want the world to see

Flipping the switch now I'm off the wall
If life is a game I need an audible
Go silent and drift away
Go find your gift today

Better beware boy before the shoddy make ya body prostrate

Liftin' crime rates
Shiftin' earth plates
Casual amongst the ranks of greats
Bitch niggas get treated and took out like dates

Have dat ass beggin' for another day like Nate

Banned, canned and jarred

Life is turned.
The day I knew you would leave
I can barely breath
Can you hear me scream

Now he walks a-lone

The eyes they drown in tears

"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand.
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Hope my life is right with Christ before its Armageddon

Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
They're saying
Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot
To come 
She's saying

I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where
we belong
So would you be my baby
Ooh-ooh

She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
If love was red then she was colour-blind
All her friends they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined
She's saying
Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith is
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars

Mamma never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch

I can hear it in my head
I can see you lying on your bed
I can see Mom in the kitchen
The smell of coffee in the air
Wishing that her little girl was there

Trying to make it on my own
I guess I could turn around
And come back home
But I'm too far gone

Though it took me half way round the world, it seems
There's all this talk and promises for better days to come
And it sounds so good, it keeps me hanging on
But I'm too far gone
Trying to make it on my own
I guess I could turn around
And come back home
But I'm too far gone
Sometimes at night my heart cries out for you
And I wonder if you hear me when I do

I can't, get you out of my mind
Your love is, one of a kind
You've given so much of yourself
I swear, don't want nobody else

I'll give you my time, give you my heart
Give you the world if you want me to
Life hasn't been easy
Knowing that you love somebody else
Ain't nothing I can do about it
All I have to blame is myself, and I can't
I thought I had you fooled
With the girls and the things that I was putting down
But little did I know
Miss Thang was spreading business all over town
I don't know what she told you
But I bounced upon the love one time
I took her to my house, laid her on the couch
Set it affray, then threw her ass out
So what about the girl in the 6-4
She didn't mean a damn thing to me baby
She needed a ride from the jam
And being the man that I am, I said ""you can""
And what about the girl in the drop-top
With the lollipop, at the light, by the bus stop
You musta beel fooled into thinkin the kid was slack
Girl I did my thing, but now I want my baby back
Girl I can't

Damn, just picked the wrong time to mess up
From the time you left me, up until this moment
I just couldn't get you off my mind
But I know if we could start all over again
I know things won't be the same
I can make it better, I swear, I swear

The beauty of the roses the sweet song of the robin
The warmth of the yellow summer sun
And the two of us together running through the meadow
Laughing making mem'ries having fun
It's a long way back to winter and the plane that came from Denver
Bringin' you to spend the summer son with your daddy to spent the summer son
This year we're gonna catch that big ole fish we saw swimming through the stream
We'll fly your kite and ride your bike maybe camp out overnight
And I'll take you to a Big League baseball game
And hopefully we'll have some time to talk about what's on your mind
And maybe I can even help you some
For I was once a boy your age and you're goin' through that special stage
Where you need your dad a lot this summer son
And I'll be there just like the summer sun
Like so many single fathers I live just to see the summer sun
Just being with my little man helpin' you to understand
Who you are and what you can become
Broken homes aren't easy but think about it this way
You've got two homes where you've loved instead of one

Every time I look around it seem
Like I'm in trouble, pressured by the devil.
Lord I love You and I really trust You.
Wish that I could hug You.
Disappear from the grain and the rubble
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under.
We ride, Eastside, blowin' in the wind.
Each time I try, they lie, no lie!
Judgin' from the outside lookin' in.
Never had a clue of what Id really do.
The ghetto pushin' through, but I'm a do it right.
Never buckle, never stop to struggle!
Layzie gotta muscle through the pressure,
Bust pipes, my life, highlights,
Bright lights, all right! Story of a warrior.
My flight, final destination, thug motivation,
Time never wastin', pacin' my stride.
Tryin' to get it good! Feel the hustle and flow.
You know we are them mighty soldiers.
Had it been for all the shit we been through
And doin' whatever but God surely knows.
So here we are steady on the go.
Its too late cause we been through crazy.
Everyday seem to bring a twist
That take us on a loop but we don't let it phase.
Raisin these babies through it.
We never run away from responsibility, but where you goin'?
Youre gonna have to face the music anyway.
Livin' through a true reality but you be blowin'!.
If they test you make em feel the pressure,
Let off some aggression and yo the flesh
Will really give em something to stress,
More likely even less.

Livin' crooked like I could.
Get cha for your goods! Make it understood! Put it on the wood!

A couple wicked rhymes
That I wrote really helped a nigga shine with my folks.
Cause, nigga, I was broke.
Eazy heard us go. And Eazy said,
Whoa, yall niggas dope!
Five niggas loc, five killer flows, y'all finna blow!
So temptation made us sign the papers overnight sensation!
Clearly chasing satan.
Niggas really famous.
Got a lot of haters, calling us the greatest,
Number one and can't nobody fade us!
Got that top spot 
And then came back fallin' down. 
I don't know what happened?
What happened? Why did Eazy die?
Whats wrong with Bizzy? He alright!
Is Flesh really comin' home? Is Bizzy comin' home?
Just wish he'd come and take Henny the dome!
I'm so high, stay faded. 
Might feel a little better but the pain stays there.
Its OK, the real gotta spike.
Everywhere we go, the hood ?
They can relate to the fight, the real from the fake.
Sound good hes alive.

As I wake up early in the morning.
Light my cigarette and wake up all my bitches.
Take a shower, quickly tell The Lord I love Him!
Didn't invite the devil cause I gave him ? evil.
I never ever thought I'd keep my candles-lit up,
Get em' hit em' get em' ? Bizzy!
Nobody know my struggle nor my hustle.
I'm a certified rider! Gave up all my children.
Women in my shit and dipping,
Now you know the Lord is always with me that's my only weapon.
Talk to every sinner Bless em'.
Then I raise my seven ? and I don't give a fuck either!

Every now and then I'm chillin'.
Nigga this is my life and I'm a live it
And give it right back to God.

"Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread
""I never even knew how much I wanted you,"" she said.
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete.
""O baby, I have come too late."" She knelt beside his feet.
""I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love.""
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view
With a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood
She said, ""I'll make a place between my legs,
I'll show you solitude.""
He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon
She took his much admired oriental frame of mind
And the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind
She took his blonde Madonna and his monastery wine
""This mental space is occupied and everything is mine.""
He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track
She said, ""The art of longing's over and it's never coming back.""
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance,
She mocked his female fashions and his working-class mustache.
The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get
A woman's education but he's not a woman yet
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy
Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy.
So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed
It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.

It's good to spend a night without him checking my phone for you, baby
We talk about life as she caught me up on drinks in no time
And oh, before you know we'll be falling in drunk and I'll be letting you know
That when you wrap me around your fingers, baby
And you make me do that shit I never do
And you pick me up on Sauchiehall street
I know I want you to myself again
The bar that you loved
Lock us in and let us keep on singing out lungs on the barstools
On the walk back to yours you made me fall in love with Glasgow
And oh, before you know I'll be carrying you over the threshold
'Cause when you wrap me around your fingers, baby

"Uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh, South side
What y'all niggas know about the dirty south?
One time
Lord forgive me for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again, and again
Yo, when you hear talk of the south side, you hear talk of the team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh, huh
This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
They roll with Easy Rider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects workin' for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat, heart me in my heart
To hear that nigga snitched on Pat
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was  was snitchin'
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX-R
Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin' jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I thought of names of games who dealt with pies
Like L A N Y's, L got shot in the neck, then told us connect
Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks
Fuckin' Dominicans turned around and gave 'em more bricks
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again, and again
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu Ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin'
Life's a bitch with a pretty face but she burnin'
Man, I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Popo under pressure too, they know what they facin'
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Patty Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
'Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royce's with Louie VaTonne interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizin', but son I'm dead serious
Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to watch the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Fed's couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again, and again
Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey
Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky, Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick, shit, a lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writin' rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Comin' up I heard sippin' too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
I'm forgettin' Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin'
And started robbin' diners, shout out to Clanvis and Clutch
Bob Dre, Black Will, if the flow don't kill you the Mac will
Lord forgive me for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top

"Touch me
I want you to be the first the last the only one to touch me
If there ever was an angel then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven here on earth then this must surely be
I want you to be the last one to touch me
The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep a thinking how happy you make me
I want you to be the last one to touch me

Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
And if I know that you've touched me then I can sleep in peace

I was oh so young back then

I still believe in happy songs. When its all chaos I sing along

Yesterday was hell
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again
Trust you is just one defense
off a list of others, you don't make sense
Beg me time and time again
to take you back now, but you can't win
Take back now, my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again,

Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you
And when that memory slips away
There will be a better view from here
And only lonesome you remains
and just the thought of you I fear
it falls away
Yesterday was hell
Today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you

Will I make it or continue and
Look at all the s**t you in
Eazy does it like happy like the s**t we used to do
5 niggaz comin' out the C-P-T so f**k you
Time changed for the good
Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this s**t back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothaf**kin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, s**t ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin
that your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me
Chorus X2
Yo mothaf**kin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your b***h, but you know this s**t is tight
Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothaf**ka's bread
I hear their b***hes sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time
Chorus X2
I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, f**k 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that b***h, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of s**t
Invest in drug money, s**t, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this s**t gon' repeat

'Cause I got number one love for New York, niggas, you heard?
I love niggas, I love niggas 'cause niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot through shit
And to all niggas that do it, I love
To all my Brooklyn

To all my Uptown

To all my Bronx

To all my Queensbridge

Back up, chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin' weed, flippin' ki's, makin' crazy Gs
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots on the avenue
Take my loot and I'm baggin' you
Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out and blow they motherfuckin' back out
That's a real nigga for ya
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho'
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho'
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery
Rough very not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. 'cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up Northbound, first stop, Watertown and fish scale
Where the hand scales are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover, doo doo stain remover
Yo, G, pass the buddha
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho'
When I was young, my M.O. was to go hand in hand
And even my P.O., she called me the 'Ginger Bread Man'
I cut ya new case and tell her ass catch me if you can
Don't let your people feel you're awkward, I tame, I'm not lame
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. Style, watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off propa
There's no place like home, New York, New York
I run this city and now I dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy 'til they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama, really
Pushy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics like Milli Vanilli
Even the hood, they feel me, I'm on fire
Niggas out in Philly, they feel me, they bump my shit
Even bootlegged, you know, bump my shit, bitch
We the realest, nigga

I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jealous of us to love us
You ain't it, G-Unit made it and Obie's comin', D-Twizzy's comin'
You sick to your stomach
50 percent is 50 Cent
The other 50 percent is who's color skin it is
Well, if you're even considering takin' our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin' to get too intricate into it
I'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit
'Cuz then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates into some other shit
Then I'ma flip, then I'ma get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's gonna feel like there's so many feet kickin' you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinkin they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggity dock diggity
Mixed with a little bit of the jiga jig jiga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cuz we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records
We the label fo' sho'
We the realest label

Talkin right, like she bout to let a nigga wear it out

And thats when she asked me had I ever did the nasty

"The moon and stars, they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him
One final breath He gave
As heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken
The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death, where is your sting?

Forever He is lifted high
 Forever He is risen

A sound that the world seldom hears
Praying, her words were pleading and dear
The sound of her voice as she spoke my name
Brought tears to my eyes, My heart filled with shame
Praying, praying for someone like me
I was walking one night and I felt so alone
My heart was so heavy from the trouble I'd known
I hadn't noticed a church that was near
Till the sound from within seemed to fill the air

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, ""Sit down,"" I stood up
Ooh...growin' up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing

Ooh...growin' up
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere, and you know it's really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth, but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car

A hint of perfume it remind me of you
Take a look at the moon it remind me of you

Actually, I'm a little scared, I'm sorry
Let's not make promises, you never know when tomorrow comes
But I really mean it when I say I like you
Don't smile at me
If I get attached to you, I'll get sad
I'm afraid that pretty smile will turn into tears
Don't try to trap us
In the word, love
Because it's a greed that can't be filled
At first, it was half excitement, half worries
But in the end, it became an obligation, trial and error
Day by day, I get nervous, your innocence is too much pressure on me
But tonight, I want you to stay
Don't expect too much from me
I don't wanna lose you either
Before things get too deep, before you get hurt
Don't trust me
You always call me
A selfish bastard
Let's not fall in love, we don't know each other very well yet
Actually, I'm a little scared, I'm sorry
Let's not make promises, you never know when tomorrow comes
But I really mean it when I say I like you

"He's in a rush run
He has to hurry dash
He's in a rat race
Never at a slow pace
Forever dangerous
And never serious
Up on your energy
Expect no sympathy
Appreciation is overrated
Resting is for fools
He lets his blood boil
Always in turmoil
Blasting his every way
Throughout the shortest day
Forever dangerous
And never serious
Swimming against the stream
And steal all of your dreams
Aggravation is appreciated
He'll use you like a tool
Association is overrated
Friends are for fools
He's in a rush
Fever round his eyes
I do not dare and cross him
He'll smash you with his lies
Ever so dangerous
He'll haunt you seriously

"As I lay me down too sleep
I pray to lord my soul too keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray to lord my soul to take
My cup full I'm laid back, I'm bout mine you know that
I'm rag racing, zoom zoom, in a rush too get all that
Cross my heart, I die hard, come through your hood in all black
If you real you'd recognize
All I do is grind and pray, riding through the streets all day
All I do is grind and pray, riding through these streets all day
They don't ever see you like I do
First thing when you wake up, before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
'Cause me and you ain't the same, you ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission, I love your ambition
And I know how it is to hit the block and get the gwop
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damm I hope somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
'Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make, so girl you know
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Single mother in college, working hard for them dollars
Girl we got something in common, making money with ballers
See you pussy popping at Onyx, keep it clapping at Magic
Got them niggas tricking at Palace
Come on making this happen
Girl I love seeing your back bend, they cashing out
And you cash in, they going broke and you working
Back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be, when income is uncertain
Hustling just too make a way, know you're thinking damn I hope
Somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
'Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make, so girl you know
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
That money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
We grind together, we shine together
Show the single folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strong's make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty, stacked up shawty
And if I ever need it, she the back up for me
Blacked up foree, his and hers 'cedes
No hoes to the house, just the first lady
So gon' get your money, don't let nobody stop that
Even if you gotta pop that 
We do it big, an no together we about to do it bigger
My little mama hustle harder than a lot of these niggas
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Make that money girl it's yours

To gigs and back stage passes
Ex-boxing champs, West end clubs
Americans in dark glasses
Driving ten grand cars, they drink in hotel bars
They're even making money in bed
They wouldn't be no loss, they aint worth a toss
It's about time they all dropped dead.

Take 'em all, take 'em all
Put 'em up against a wall and shoot 'em
Short and tall, watch 'em fall
Come on boys take 'em all
Well tough shit boys, it aint our fault
Your record didn't make it
We made you dance, you had your chance
But you didn't take it
Well, I gotta go make another deal
Sign another group for the company
I don't suppose we'll ever meet again
You'd better get back to the factory.

Take 'em all, watch 'em fall

It wakes your nightmare again

So just run
Run as fast as you can

No honest man's words can bear all this cutting
Bored cities the babes drugs round
Filters ill-fitting and labored
Drown
I've covered my tracks with mistakes
Unasticking the stars mirrored backs
The sky leaks
They're looking with eyes glittered black
No heart breaks
How's it not enough when it never ends?
Well, I know
It ended long ago... I wish
So many people clung to the shore
Each one's now singing
Much better than before
Look at those people
Clung to the shore
Each one's now singing
Much better than before
Better than before",Indie

First chapter
You stole my heart away from me
Made me believe true love could be
We were so close you changed my life
How could a love so strong not go right
Where do we go from here?
When it's said our love would stay around
Why do I even care
The way you looked it can't be found
My heart is broken down
I'm turning pages once again
It's time to make this story end
Time to close the book to this story
I don't want to read it no more
Time to close the book to this story
Another writer will come along, I'm sure
Final chapter
I say goodbye, I made you cry
I did what I could, you know I tried
There's no more to say, so I'll go my way
You know that it hurts me
But that's the price we pay
Where do we go from here?
When it's said our love would stay around
Why do I even care
When I looked it can't be found
My heart is broken down
I'm turning pages once again
It's time to make this story end

about that lil' dog that couldn't see too well
He was crossing a railroad track one day,
when the train cut off a part of his tail
He turned around but never looked up, just to peep over the rail
And she said he lost his whole head, trying to find a little piece of tail

Too much responsibility and no one is

Circles and cycles

This pointless masquerade
A dangerous game

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Well baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Consumed by the shadows

Somehow I made it through the heartace

I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith
Kept my faith
And the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
I don't regret a single moment
Looking back, when I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh, I just laugh
And the river was deep I didn't falter

When the valley was low

I want to be bathed in
sinking fish and sunlight
The vivid unknown
The magic that disappears when I stumble
The cracked sky visible beyond
the preparations
On the rooftops of the ruins
Enclosing the whisperings of struggling down feathers

Clad in the roar of the scattered light
We are a bouquet
Plucked wings
Words
Blown backwards without a breath
Scattering beautifully
Sea bird
In the midst of the ebb and flow
A lying star
twinkling in the sky
Leading us away
We row our boat
A midnight sea
A resonating salty wind and a brightly burning world
cover my cheeks
In the middle of a whirlpool
made of crowded voices
I hold your hand and go under the rain of needles
In the darkening scenery
I play with a falling upside-down heat haze
and dance with time

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line

It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss
One, two, three, four
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul

Rejection of society and the desire...
to destroy it.

Because back through time, many men have died.
It's all the same; many will be slain.
Long live the rebels, the flashed in the sky.
Iran, Pakistan, many countries lie.
Middle East in turmoil, ironic sick game.
Looks like the world's slowly going insane.
Bombs and arms, the missiles in the sky.

why is there still terrorism?

Ronal Reagan was shot here at home.
Oktoberfest murders in Munich, Germany.
Sixty hostages in the Turkish embassy.

And the wounds are hidden so you cannot feel the pain
For I have chosen the path of misery and sorrow
And my skin will continue to wither and decay
Happiness - where are you?
Will this grief be swept away?
This madness must stop or this world I'll depart
As reality blends into horrific dreams
My departure from Earth is getting near
And as I approach death, I'll show no fear
I need you here to ease this pain
For I fear it shall never dissipate
Yet you are so far away and the blood continues to flow
I felt your warmth - I can't touch your skin
Remembering, as the knife caresses my flesh
And I summon forth suffering and despair
Yet it is something I do not wish to do
My blood absorbs the poisons
Drugged, confused - the walls enclose around me
My mind is so high - my spirit continues to fall
And the anguish recedes as life slips away
Breathless, I beckon eternal sleep
For I shall live no more to be with you

My fear makes me blind
The room is cursed perhaps.

I can see my brother too.

I see him embrace our mother.

But Death reflected in her eyes of blue.
I've been a fugitive all my life,

Invisible hands are taking.

Smooth as Frank Sinatra with a m************ slick back
No rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks
Counting singles in my Shaqs, stacking Pringles from the crack
N**** I was on the bus with it
Had 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt
Andrew Luck with it
We had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it
Jay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it

The birds sweetly tune on each bough
And as I walked out for my pleasure
I saw a maid milking a cow
Her voice was so enchanting, melodious
Left me quite unable to go
My heart, it was loaded with sorrow
For the pretty maid milking her cow
Then to her I made my advances
""Good morrow most beautiful maid
Your beauty my heart so entrances""
""Pray sir do not banter,"" she said
""I'm not such a rare precious jewel
That I should enamour you so
I am but a poor little milk girl,""
Says the pretty maid milking her cow
The Indies afford no such jewel
So bright, so transparently clear

Get crossed up, death becomes untimely
While time keeps winding, niggaz keep grinding
Chasin paper, so outrageous, they just stand by, staring in amazement
You don't wanna be the one found under the basement
Gotta run your DNA just to find what your name is

With likeness to shades much deeper than dull
The infinite abyss forever holds

Brought down by stabs of rage without fear
Gashed hearts worked deep who refuse to hear

located the stash and he rolled up a jay.

he lay down on the couch and he went to sleep.

Finding out what went wrong
Why you made me cry
But if this fire alarm should start
I'm gonna run to you
We'll find the exit, climb the stairs
Into the sky so blue
And if this building now should fall
I will be crushed with you
It's just a reflex after all
But I wanna be with you
I've been ignoring you
Oh, why
Looking the other way as you pass me by
I've been avoiding you
Oh why everything's amber-lit
Since we said goodbye
But if this fire alarm should start
I'm gonna run to you
We'll find the exit, climb the stairs
Into the sky so blue
And if this building now should fall
I will be crushed next to you
In case you should forget to ask
I'm still in love with you
Aaahhh!!!!",Pop
"The subjects of sleep
Their faces once awake
on sodomy and death
and smoke and laughter
their feet no longer
underground
The snow hides the traces
never set in a first place
This negative kingdom
hey horrible and white
the angels all stone
passing their years
hoping to be saved
from oblivion
...by oblivion
And the miracle is that
nothing has happened
nothing has a history
or a name",Metal
"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it; farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and by
Faithful till death said our loving master; a few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates
Farther along we'll know all about it...
Yes, we'll understand it all by and by",Country

"You say your hurting is over.
It feels like you're back from the dead.
But still I can't believe it's over,
And I can't get your sight, your scent from my head.
It seems like these moments are lasting forever,
The times when we felt alive.
You carried my heart in the midst of this battle
In your hands.
This time I won't try to reach you.
You're already too far gone.
Slipped past and I didn't notice,
Did we ever sing the same song?
Two lives, two books of illusion,
A chapter in the essence of time.
The story we wrote in one season,
Came to an end in one night.
Remember the times when we started believing,
That everything would be alright?
You carried my heart in the midst of this battle...
In your hands.
And I'll wait for you. I'll become something new.
And I'll sing for you until this dream comes true",Rock

there must have been some magic in
that old silk hat they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around

was alive as he could be
and the children say he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me

so he said let's run and we'll have some fun
now before i melt away
down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
running here and there all around the square
saying catch me if you can
he led them down the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
and they only paused a moment when
they heard him holler ""stop!""

And I felt the sunlight sparkle warm
Out from his magic shoes
And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper

Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy, anne and I want you to hold me

I answer yes and he blew his golden horn
Then the violins and the trumpets rang out he led them all
In a coat of many colors patched and torn
And he swung me to a loving sound
While the fiddlers played and pranced around
He spun so fast 'til we left the ground
Then the music filled the heavens with a joyful noise
The stars would dance to greet us as we'd come
Then he'd wave his hand and send them back to the morning light
And we'd keep climbing through the midnight sun
On a rocking horse with wings we'd fly
To a place where dreams can never die
Lovers little children in the sky
So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see

Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man

Fear of loosing memories in the daily haze

All just fragments of disposable waste
A cesspool of terror, displaying hate
I have to face the day
Still denying this obvious truth

I don't know if I can face
All the fears, that is tearing me down
Yea, I'm trying to be brave
But I'm afraid, about to fade
I wanna stand but I don't know how
I look up and all I see is Your love holding me
When I feel like giving up
When my heart is hurt too much
Feels like I've reached the end
No, I won't turn and run
This battle will be won
When I've done all I can
I stand stand stand
I stand stand stand
Some days I lose my place
It's a fight to keep my faith
But You are with me, I am not alone, no
But all around my work is late
Toss like an ocean wave
You are my rock and the storm clouds blow
I look up and all I see is Your love holding me
When I feel like giving up
When my heart is hurt too much
Feels like I've reached the end
No, I won't turn and run
This battle will be won
When I've done all I can
I stand stand stand
I stand stand stand
On Your promise, I will stand
Oh look the ground is sinking sand
On Your promise, I will stand
Oh look the ground is sinking sand
Sinking sand oh who woooh
It's sinking sinking, yea ye
When I feel like giving up
When my heart is hurt too much
Feels like I've reached the end
No, I won't turn and run
This battle will be won, yea yea

I stand stand

When n****z get the beefin', I be laughin'
'Cause I can send my homies through to blast them
Stick 'em with the hump, or just slash 'em
""Now fool are you crazy?"" is what we ask 'em
But back to me and you shorty, decide, think
First I'll put the burnin', it's the G-string
Leave it up to me, we can do it my way
And get straight to it, skip the fore play

"Not many years their rounds shall roll
Each moment brings it nigh
And all your glories stand revealed
To our admiring eye
You wills of nature speed your course,
You mortal powers decay
Fast as you bring the night of death
You bring eternal day
You weary heavy-laden souls
Who are oppressed sore
You travelers through the wilderness
To Canaan's peaceful shore
Through beating winds and chilly rains,
And waters deep and cold
And enemies surrounding you
Have courage and be bold
The storms and hurricanes arise
The desert all around
And fiery serpents oft appear
Through the enchanted ground
Dark night and clouds and gloomy fear
And dragons often roar
But when the gospel trump we hear
We'll press for Canaan's shore",Folk
" intro
the word is not simply a scribbled symbol or a spoken sound
the word is not like a roaring lion that no one really fears
no, the word has power
and it can be you most trusted friend
or your most terrible foe
you see like a seed the word gives life
like a lamp the word gives light
like a mirror the word reflects
like water the word washes
like fire the word cleanses
like a hammer the word shatters
like a sword the word cuts
ohhh but like medicine the word heals
and like a consular the word comforts
you see the word is alive
and it is waiting, waiting for you to summon it like a soldier
and send it forth into battle

they tell me i sound like a prophet

mistakin theres been to much faith in
thorough nigga business we keepin it solid
im ready to teach and learn
educatin for this heaven on earth
overcomin all my family doubts

no man to observe
shit can get worse but we pull it through
im illuminatin that entire equation creatin
i no you cant see it right now
but im teachin my niggas to better communicators
they dumbin us down one by one huntin us down
i try not to sound like a preacher
but if our daughters and sons are kings and queens
they have to be prepped to be leaders
following order and steps the man with the plan
gets most the respect
so im bowing down with my hands together forever
prayin for anyone whose losin their strength
we in this together right

when found in what i was reading
and now i feel like its what i should be teaching

you cannot criticize anything that you do
if youre always a student to life
a product of truth
sad part if its hard to be yourself
you apart of it to
now im breaking it down
so its understanding me
philosophy comes with the proof
success requires a push
straight forward is the only way to look
i head if you wanna hide something from a nigga
the best way to do it is to put it in a book
so they make this shit difficult
imma talk about the principles
in general and individuals
you ballin, you made it, you happy, you flexin
every rappers story sounds identical

"Some are born to wealth, and given shelter from the storm
Some were always held and had a fire to keep them warm
Some are born to poverty with no roof above their head
Some are facing suicide and wishin' they were dead
There are those with flowing rivers right outside their door
Refugees in boats who may never reach the shore
Some pray for rain and the pay for it in blood
When it rains for forty days we are all victims of the flood
Somewhere a brave heart must survive
Yes someday the truth will bury the lie
Yah somewhere a brave heart must survive
Too many here been prisoners deserving to be free
Too many in the darkness and they have no eyes to see
In the middle of the night they are taken from their homes
And they dig a common grave to cover up their flesh and bones
But a new day in dawning for the beggars and the blind
For those who have suffered and were always left behind
But the chains will be broken and the fences will come down
And we will walk as brothers once again on the sacred ground
Somewhere a brave heart must survive
Yes someday the truth will bury the lie
Yah somewhere a brave heart must survive",Folk
"Some people often break up over silly things
And soon they will find out all the hurt it brings

Can we skip that part baby, in our lives, oh baby
You're never going to find a lover

The price you pay for love weights so heavy
And when it's gone you weighted down with misery

Oh, can we skip that part baby, in our lives
Stay with me, lay with me, baby

"The Power Of Orange Knickers Lyrics
The power of orange knickers
The power of orange knickers
The power of orange knickers
Under my pretty coat
The power of listening to what
You don't want me to know
Can somebody tell me now who is this terrorist
Those girls that smile kindly then rip your life to pieces?
Can somebody tell me now am I alone with this
This little peal in my hand and with this secret kiss
Am I alone in this...
A matter of complication
When you become a twist
For their latest drink
As they're transitioning
Can somebody tell me now who is this terrorist
This little peal in my hand that keeps the pain laughin'
Can somebody tell me now a way out of this -
That secret part of red stone could blow me out of this kiss
Am I alone in this...
Shame shame time to leave me now
Shame shame you've had your fun
Shame shame for letting me think that I would be the number one
Can somebody tell me now who is this terrorist
This little peal in my hand or this secret kiss
Am I alone in this kiss
Am I alone in this kiss",Indie
"It's a sea of thoughts where I will drown
The diary of my life is burnt
I can't pretend, can't drive your face away
Your intimate voice is dumb
I'll always see your wistful eyes
The tears you cried will never dry
Every word you said comes back again
Spread your wings and fly
Dance with my shade
Like the leaves in that stormy night you passed away
All my zest for life is gone
The scenes of yesterdays will never fade
Too many words are left unsaid
I'll spread my wings to be with you",Rock
"Summer is strange, not what it used to be
Sun's blinding me but it's still so cold in here
There's something in the air
Something, that I can't define

All I've done can't be forgiven
The selfish first born son, yes, that's who I am
I go on and on. I can't fill my greed
Destroy everything for a piece of nothing
Warning signals all around:
Prodigal son's been left behind
No one sees what's plain to see
We cause our own insanity
We made a warfield of our homes
Prodigal son's been left alone
How can you turn your face away?!
We dig our own graves everyday

'cause I'm a quick to stop a nigga in his tracks main
So lets get this shit out in the open

Now it's a whole different ball game niggas that carry guns
A sucka will kill you first, and you will be layin' in the hurst
Takin' a deep ass sleep knowin' it wasn't worth
Provin' you wasn't a punk
Niggas don't want to thump
Niggas just want to funk and shot up a niggas trunk
I met a bitch last week at the Orgen Room
Bought her a drink and said ""what's up on the telly room?""
Just then I felt some trouble kickin' in
Spotted her X-boyfriend who had just got out the pen
Motherfuckers get to baulkin' when the liquors talkin'
Drunk motherfucka' step on my toe and kept on walkin'
I said ""what's up with ya potna, say excuse me or somethin'""
He turned around looked at me and started mean muggin'
I guess he thought he pumped fear until I said
""Nigga don't you know I'll have you touchin' everything in here""
He went for his pistol and didn't know I was strapin'
Dag nab it, I had to let him have it
What type of nigga did he think you was E?
I know he didn't think that you were some kind of peanut or somethin'.
He must of been retarded to the fact that you get a thrill out of killin'
Now tell me somethin' why do motherfuckers wait till that nigga commits
Himself to realize that a hillside hillbilly is the wrong type of
Nigga to Fuck with? E do you feel me?
Yeah I feel ya sahob
Well lets take it to the next page then
Oh you mean that part about the dungeon?
You know!
The next morning, I'm sittin' in the dungeon-wonderin'
Should I be dissed nope I did it in self defense
I wasn't twisted, I hadn't even started yet
It happened to fast before someone could stop me
I wish I had some dank weed
While I wait out these 24 more hours before I plead
Freedom I'm gonna miss ya 
Made me some dice out of some water and toilet tissue
Now this the part that's fucked up
I walks into the day room manner room what the fuck
I never thought that I would straight make ah
The front page of the newspaper
Shut up a do wop, shut up a do wop
Man they bout to send me up state ah
Talking that shit about makin' me a motheruckin' faggot
I make a shank outta plastic and let a nigga have it
That's what's really goin' down
'cause when a motherfuckers down for the count
You gotta be about it or be without it
'cause what a motherfucker once told me see a mark sleep
Leave him sleep in the middle of the street
If you can't stand the heat stay up out the kitchen",Hip-Hop

"I will wait for you
Like I promised I would do
Although it brings me pain
And you always knew
What to say to lead me to
Believe it's not in vain
I was safe and secure
When you were with me
But it only could last
'Til the day that she
Took you back again

So I get by
On wishful thinking
That when you come home
You'll want to stay
Give me your hand
Save me from sinking
Another day
Of wishful thinking
Sometimes it's lonely
And faith don't come easy
And dreams begin to fade
Then you reassure me
How good it's gonna be
When you come back someday
You said you'd be back
After you said goodbye
I have to believe
That it wasn't a lie
And you'll be here again

I was safe and secure
When you were with me
But it only could last
'Til the day that she
Took you back again

Give me your hand

"One morning in the silence of nature
Two shadows dance in the sunrise
Never knowing what's on the other side of the wall
What is it hiding this absence of secrets
Behind the gate to the unknown
Lying obscure behind these highest walls
What is hiding in the garden of secrets, behind the wall
Who is the creator of these illusions of lies
A brand new project Eden
Evil seeds just waiting to bloom
Someone is testing human fate
Living in this world of secrets
In an underground sphere of science
Searching for the place where all evil began
Born into this state of innocence
An Arcadia of coming future life
Reality strikes
When the two headed snake bites
Fooled by the serpent
Who took a bite
Of the forbidden fruit
From the holy tree
Fooled by the serpent
Someone took a bite
Of the forbidden fruit
In the garden
What is hiding in the gardens of secrets, behind the wall
Who is the creator of these illusions of lies
A brand new project Eden
Evil seeds just waiting to bloom
Someone is testing human fate
Occasional sinners
That breeds
And form new life
One day someone will go back
To the place where all evil began
Only those who pray every day will find the light
With guidance on their way
Heading back to the land behind the gate
Back to the land of all evil
I feel cold
When the night takes over
Will we ever find our peace again
We must search for another home far across the fields
Towards what tomorrow will bring
We will be strong
Together we will make it
And never be tempted by evil again
We must leave
To find our new home beyond the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk to find the light
Fooled by the serpent
Who took a bite
Of the forbidden fruit
From the holy tree
Fooled by the serpent
Someone took a bite
Of the forbidden fruit
In the garden
What is hiding in the gardens of secrets, behind the wall
Who is the creator of these illusions of lies
A brand new project Eden
Evil seeds just waiting to bloom
Someone is testing human fate",Metal

So far away from home
So far away from me

I feel it's time for us to get back together

Is anybody even tryin?

Sometimes love has to drive a nail into its own hand
Sometimes love has to drive a nail into its own hand, into its own hand
One pair of Hands broke some bread and washed some feet
Opened eyes and soothed an angry sea
Belong to a Man who could see our deepest need
And showed us love the way it has to be
Cause He knew the price that love requires
And He laid down His own desires
He stretched out His hands to save His friends
And said 'no other love is higher'

Sometimes love has to drive a nail into its own hand, into its own hand

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love

Behind his mask
He knew the truth

Just pay today
Pay today
World's dressed in black
On earth's judgement day
And I?
I know it can't go on

I'm sitting still at home
And watching
Born in a mourning hall
Pale clouds feared the unborn child
Then it grew up with growing plans
Of suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear inside
That Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
It's frightening
Exciting to sit at home
And watch the burning fields
Get
Hypnotized by the TV snake
Obey and work hard
And feel no anger
Just sympathy for the higher class
There's no chance in changing things
'Cause I am
Born in a mourning hall
Silent cries ran out
When the cradle breaks
Broken dreams were unheared on
The other side
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear
In the new born child
That Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
And I'm a part of the machine
A puppet on the strings
A rebel, once
Now I'm an old man
Oh, I know this can't go on
But the ghost called fear inside
Lames my tongue, my nerves, my mind
Eternal fall down
Someone cut the strings off
I can't move
To get back courage
I've to face the truth
But not today
Goodbye
Born in a mourning hall
Caught inside a web called life
The only way to get out soon
Is suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Pale souls built a frozen world
Infected brains
Will never reach the other side
The other side",Metal

This is the life in our own divine comedy
Wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and gluttony

" Charlie Hust`, Busta Bust`, let`s do it

Hehehehe, Flipmode, Sic-Wid-It
You know what`s best for you, you better get widdit

I heard him talkin, but then he walkin, now tell me why
They never been incarcerated in a correctional facility
For doin this kinda street chemistry 
I`m an original rapper, retrospected by plenty, hated by people
Me, 40, we took it back as street soldier
You got my back I got your shoulder
Peas and toes, tryin to make it, it`s all oh`s
Impossible is a hit never get caught diggin in my nose
Ex d-boy used to be a big time neighborhood rock star
Although I never owned a gui-tar
I-uh-I`m lyrically inclined with my start stutter scrilla
Type delivery, 40 and Busta Rhymes, was drinkin
And smockin hickory, on the porch one time
When I came up with this line: I was perkin
Off of some of that Carlos Rossi wine -- whatcha playa patnah got
Flows, like a latina female orgasm
Hoes, be yellin and screamin causin contractions at my
Shows, they take off they clothes and throw they pantyhose on stage
Any appliable age from dookie braids to suki braids, deal widdit
Chorus:
Do it to me baby, do it to meeeee!

Just do anything you want to do to meeeee!

Do it to me baby, do it to meeeee!


Just do anything you want to do to me

Just do anything you want to do to me


Check it out yo
Do it to me I`ma do it to you
Rubber you glue, bounce off of me I stick it on you
Weather whatever you could never ever measure my pleasure
Dig in my treasure, be making your lungs cave in together
Blow smoke out my face, pick up the pace
Speed up the race, never let a hot joint go to waste
My dogs`ll bark when your marksman trespass
You better use caution, your body parts might get auctioned
No need for you to keep stalkin, HELL but what you talkin
Have you dusted like a zombie lookin straight Christopher Walken
Shorty tried to call me and warn me and E-40
About these other corny rappers that ain`t got nuttin for me
You know they all blew it, time to move it
Blow the spot you knowin how we do it, capitalize
Upgrade to gold now we platinum-eyes
Keep my flavor holy sacred and pasteurized, WHAT!
Chorus

We doin this to blow through it til you suffocate, losin your breath
Til you satisfied, you know we do it to death
Ay you know we do it to keep you flippin, do it for whylin
Doin it for me to get my hustle on, do it for profilin
Do it for the love affair because I`m lovin it
When we clubbin all you hear is the live DJ rubbin it
Runnin it all into the ground, doin it for days
Do it for money, know I gotta keep my bills paid!

My reals be pokin and stickin out like nipples
The felines, be lookin at us like we some popsicles
Busta Rhyzzzimes, and Charlie Hustle, or should I say Fonzarelli
Poppin they collars and workin they star jelly
Up in the club, order the one, the party`s just begun
Love, batches outnumber the fellas ten to one push come to
Shove, forgot my gun, but it won`t hurt fool
My music come up out the woodwork, beatch!

"I have the reputation that's known throughout the land
They say I'm master on the draw of any livin' man
They call me a bad man, they say I kill for fun
They say the only thing I know is how to use a gun
But they don't know the reason they branded me as bad
It started many years ago when I was just a lad
I rode into a cattle town, a boy of twenty-three
So young and yet that very day I carved my destiny
I walked into the town saloon that sad and faithful day
Then I began to gamble to pass the time away
I thought I played a hand or two then hit the thrill again
But Lady Luck was with me and I began to win
The dealer kept on dealin', the stakes were gettin' high
And pretty soon there was no one left but an old cowboy and I
The minutes seemed like hours, you couldn't hear a sound
We've been in race until we'd lay all our money down
The cowboy smiled and showed his hands, three aces he did hold
But I laid down the royal flush and reached to claim my gold
The cowboy stood and faced me, his hands hung on his hips
A look of hate was in his eyes and the smile had left his lips
He said, ""Young man, slap leather, I'm known for miles around
To keep my reputation about I got to gun you down""
White lightnin' speeded through that fire, one life will be the cost
The cowboy crumbled to the floor, his reputation lost",Rock
"Hear that lonesome whipoorwill he sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever hear a robin weep when leaves began to die
That mean he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry",Country

There's a young girl dancing free
Twiling in circle by the front porch light
Out on the street of dreams, out on the street of dreams
Further down there's a family
there's a young couple in their teens
Their baby smiling at a barking dog
It was down on the street of dreams
There on the street of dreams
And they still go where they want to
And the will be who the will be
Cause there are no walls around their hearts
On the street of dreams, their on the street of dreams
Two older men talk of days gone by
And of a world they've never seen
Their hearts are young but they've traveled far
On down the street of dreams, their on the street of dreams
And they still go where they want to
And the will be who the will be
Cause there are no walls around their hearts

You can be who you will be

But your heart's a million miles away

But I won't give up cause I believe
Love is still alive in me and you
Together we can pull it through
Let go
We can leave our doubts here in the dark

"See the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig
And then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been there a crying
Over some sad and silly late, late show
And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
So afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
Found her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robins sing, she went away
And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
Yes, one day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories
Of honey and I wake up nights and call her name
And now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed that honey loved
Yes, see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

Soft as a rose that blooms in May

Dressed them, amused them pullin' wool over our eyes

"God dammit Amy, we're not kids any more.
You can't just keep waltzing out of my life,
Leaving clothes on my bedroom floor,
Like nothing really matters, like pain doesn't hurt.
You should be more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt.
You kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I made when I was a kid,
With a disassembled disposable razor I stole from my dad,
When I thought that suffering was something profound,
That weighed down on wise heads,
And not just something to be avoided,
Something normal people dread.
God dammit Amy, well of course I've changed.
With all the things I've done and the places I've been
I'd be a machine if I had stayed the same.
But you're still back where we started, you haven't changed at all.
You're still trying to live like a kid, like you can always have it all.
You know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I hid as best I could,
That I covered with ink, but in the right kind of light they still bleed through,
Showing that there are some things I just can't change no matter what I do:
The tell-tale signs of being used,
Of being trapped inside of you.
You're a beautiful butterfly
Burned with a branding iron
Onto my outsides into my insides
As a simple sign:
To show off your ownership.
Burned into my naked skin,
Onto my outsides into my insides.
It's not even love any more,
It's just a claim upon my soul.
It stains my skin, yeah it's on my breath,
And I'm ashamed to get undressed
In front of strangers in case they see
The tell tale signs that you have left all over me.
God dammit Amy.
You'll always remind me of scars on my arms that I know will never fade.
And it's not like it's something I think about each and every day -
I just occasionally catch myself scratching them, as if they'd ever go away.
But these tell tale signs are here to stay, and in the end you know that's OK.
You will always be a part of my patched-up patchwork taped-up tape-deck heart.",Indie

"You know youre past
A mid-way mark
Yeah its too late
To turn back
Tomorrow will be
Clean of this day
Dont worry so much
You will find your way
And you wish it would rain
Cos youre thirsty again
But it wont hurt a bit
Like a kiss on your lips
Take a bite, heres a light
Theres a hole in the night
Just go through
Its for you
Itll be alright
Theres still time
If we run
Some reasons are
Best forgotten
The night wont wait forever
It keeps getting better
And better
Hold me close
Pull me near
There is nothing to fear
Let it go

Cos the frost is all gone
Theres a light in your eyes
You can drop your disguise
Cos youre so brand new
And theres so much loving to do
Look at you now
Youre high as a kite
Head full of stars you are
Travelling light
Youre on your own
But youre not alone
If you look around
You will find you are home

"Everything,
O everything is different from what I felt in the past
Somehow it changed to an informal mass
The changes, they fill me with restless seeking
The mark,
O yeah the mark it vanished in indistinct clarity
The mark that was given to me by his hand
I know this way I have to wander
I know this change I have to get through
Every step in this bewildered way
Every breath from the wheezing chest
A mistaken attempt to find my way
To see the things beyond the flesh
Derisively talking in every direction
Resounding echoes inside my empty head
Hungry watchers with eyes like cunning snakes
Awaiting my collapse under the tremendous weight
Exhausted by seeking tired of the unknown
He is the same though another to me
Yet I am the one who is the variation
The word will remain in my alteration
The word will remain",Metal

"
I watched my mom die, I wanna go too but I won't
My girl kicked me out, left me homeless and alone
Sold my car for cash, spent it on booze and dope
Guy on the couch, barely moved for the phone
Truth is, I was born, emotionally broke
And music's, how I handle all the ominous tones
Almost sold my Supras but I took 'em on the road
I know I can be super, I'm just starting slow
Gotta walk the tightrope, avoid curve balls thrown
Give me Trinidad's gold, even I wanna glow
I've always been afraid of not pushing envelopes
Now I leave myself notes and they all say 'no'
Even MTV folk, tell me that dope, though
Most people in the game hide behind cloaks
I guess they say God says you gotta keep hope
Even Agnostic AWK gotta keep it on the go 

Go! Gotta go gotta go gotta
Tryna keep up
Glow! Gonna glow gonna go gonna glow gonna
I gotta glow! Go!
Gotta go gotta go gotta
Tryna keep up!
Glow!
I gotta glow!

I'm in a lazy Thunderbird, with some Minnesota plates
Scraping up the curb, just to get up in ya face
Ain't you heard, probably maybe
We beat, the breaks off, the novelty break beats
Toggle the safety, and follow the gravy
Passed out off a half a bottle a Jamie
I laugh now and I don't even know what ya said
You assed out like you got a whole in ya head
Clothing optional, we can't stop the show
And still, we pretend anything's possible
I got a whole lot a words for thirst
But the rest of the search, depends on the work
Standing on top of this dirt, so let me celebrate
It's another day, for us to elevate
I got nothing but go, we don't rest or play
I kinda like how it sound, what the hell she say? 


Yeah that's right, I stays on the move
'Til yall tired a seeing my face on the tube
'Til the clubs spinning my joints to make it pop
'Til my feet in white sand and ya feet still play the block
Ya still tryin chase that deal, aight guys
I'm chillin, got a nice little spot in a high rise
Execs still telling yall all the laws got bye bye
That sucks, just bought a truck and new bike that I ride
It goes, 'vroom vroom', with a fatty in a thong
Sorry I had to go, but I'm happy that I'm gone
Don't you wish you could rhyme and get at me on a song
Well yall can't and I can, like Nas, so run along
You won't break me, instead I'm a break free
And paint a clear picture for the world in HD
So put ya eyes underneath where your shades be
Baby I gotta glow, feedback, but I gotta go

Tryna keep up
Cause I gotta go
Ought to keep up
Cause I'm gonna grow
Ya need to keep up

Word up, I be the one they call Justo if ya didn't know,
Tryin' to check my man DJ Skee,
With his new mix tape,
Pick it up ya square,
Ya heard what I'm sayin?

It's another sad day in hip-hop,
We lost another one of my brothers,
Justo Faison,
We love you,
And we'll always miss you,
Mix tape king,
Forever...
We'll always love you Justo x4

I picked up my pen four years from the day,
Never thought I'd be rappin, or even signed to Dre,
I never been to New York, I had to find a way,
So I dropped 40 bars on a clue mix tape,
On a Birdman beat, then my name started buzzin,
Aftermaths young gun and now everybody love him,
I hooked up with Gavin, Foxy's lil brother,
He took me to K Slay and Slay put me on the cover,
Drama King I shoulda known, cause all of a sudden,
Emcees callin' my name and I'm beefin' wit Joe Budden,
That beef came and went, I got at him over Colours,
Then caught him at Def Jam, found out it wasn't nothin,
Look back at my career starin' out at the city,
Thinkin' about the biddin' war between Dre and Diddy,
If I was signed to bad boy, would 50 be on the math?
Probably not but maybe Justo wouldn't have crashed.

We'll always love you Justo x4

I remember when Funk Flex first heard me flow,
And Sway let me freestyle on the wakeup show,
Spit over a 100 bars then Miss Jones started to host,
That's when they started showing me love on the east coast,
Then more people found out, I was with Dre,
And at Bodega's I'm on 9 outta 10 of the mix tapes,
I'm workin' on my album and the world cant wait,
Cover of the vibe, and I ain't even have a release date,
Then I met Justo he told me if I stay hungry,
I'd go platinum and nobody can take that from me,
He joked about my rap beefs, I thought it was funny,
Gave him a pound then slid him 200 Bars and Runnin'
Went upstairs to change, got dinner at five,
Went to Houstons and that's the first time I met Nas,
Had billboard wit me and two months later he died,
So this is what it sounds like when thugs cry.

We'll always love you Justo x4

Markin' off days on the calendar I can't even sleep,
Like a convict, waitin' on January 18th,
When the documentary dropped, it flooded the streets,
My mix tape buzz made me gold the first week,
Double platinum in two months,
Record labels gettin' scared,
Cause the kid from Compton sellin like Sunny and Cher,
Mix tape awards came around, glad I was there,
To get my award, mix tape artist of the year,
Stepped on stage, and Justo let 'em know,
You might as well crown him the new king of the west coast,
A couple of months passed and we aint speak,
My sidekick went off 
I let everybody from Snoop to Busta know,
A car crash just claimed the life of Justo,
They say the good die young, if ya know like I know,
Live ya life to the fullest one day we all gotta go.

Give a moment of silence,
If you're wearing a Fiddy cap take it off,
If you driving, pull over to the side of the road,
We lost an underground legend,
Justo Faison,
Mix tape king,
Rest In Peace.",Hip-Hop

"Check it out, oh
Detroit city got me gritty I'm filthy I can't help it
I really hope to make it with this hand I was dealt with
Staring out my rear view, looking for a clear view
It's hard to pray to God when you feel the devils near you
Kids turn to burglars, streets are full of murders
Enough to turn you cold so we all pack burners
Junkies by the furnace and they trying to keep warm
Doing right ain't feeling right so I rather do wrong
The world is on fire you can hear the bodies burning
The oil is running out but the wheels keep turning
Tomorrow ain't certain so I'm living for today
I hope to go to college but prison's in the way
Enough stress to turn me crazed so I'm looking much older
You kill for colder if you turn the wrong corner
Life expectancy is shorter than you really can imagine
Hope to see 23, the only thing I'm asking
It's another day alone, it's a war to survive
I'm all on my own, hope to make it home alive
It's the street life, street life
It's the street life, street life
My heart's turned to stone man it's almost like it died
You could run and run forever but there ain't no where to hide
It's the street life, street life
It's the street life, street life
Now who the hell's there, someone's knocking on my door
I feel death is out to get me hope to make it out for sure
There ain't a star in the sky so it's hard to make a wish
I might be the next to die, hard to see through the mist
Blowing kiss from my mother, give a hug to my brother
Light a candle on the mantle, say a prayer, say another
It's a street life, we fight for everything we got
It's the street life, three strikes, the only thing we got
I make my money in the hallway, feast by the doorway
Sell a pack, make a stack, I'll be here all day
Hustle when it's broad day, forget what the law say
Welcome to the jungle you a long way from broadway
Never knock the hustle and they really would've see is
Pistol packin in my jeans, see the demons in my dreams
Now what does it mean when your body turns numb?
And you're scared of what's comin so you begin to run
It's another day alone, it's a war to survive
I'm all on my own, hope to make it home alive
It's the street life, street life
It's the street life, street life
My heart's turned to stone man it's almost like it died
You could run and run forever but there ain't no where to hide
It's the street life, street life
It's the street life, street life
Call the cops, call the swastik, gotta mend me a loose
Doose doose in my goose ain't no calling a truce
I spit the truth and nothing but it, now why can't I kick the bucket
I'm used to having nothing so I'm always having something
Have my mind on the front, why the hell would I lie
I know exactly where I'm going, why the hell should I try
Everybody's getting locked up, bodies turning chopped up
Girls are being knocked up, money's being mocked up
You could get socked up so watch how you talking
The whole city's scorching so watch where you walking
This can happen often so it's really nothing new to me
Usually, you could catch a kiss before puberty
People's screaming unity but nothing seems to change
Everybody's on the way, diamond knows what's in my brain
Enough to make a man insane, all I feel is the rain
I wanna welcome you to the city full of pain
It's another day alone, it's a war to survive
I'm all on my own, hope to make it home alive

"Who am I addressing now?
It seems as though I'm only ever talking to myself
The mirrors there, but I don't see my face anywhere.
No matter how straight I stare
Even when there's nothing there,
Still talking like its everywhere.
I'm just stuck, on everything,
Everything that I let get to me.
Its controllable, but
It just slips and rolls,
All over these fingers,
And these clothes
Until its stains,
Become the new plain,
And not even the rain,
Can make it change.
What should have been an itch,
Became a rash
Im just living in whatever hit me last.
Letting the blow to the floor,
Keep me from moving anywhere,
Or keep me from moving anymore
Just letting the blow to the floor,
Keep me from moving anywhere and anymore

Not too smooth, not too rough.

For what I can't let go of",Indie

voices from the valley bellow,

Voices from the top of the mountains,
voices from the valley below,

and the angels will cry... just like the time before.

Did she cook your favorite dinner last night 
Did she wear something sexy to bed

Hey now I've this feeling
That I've never felt before,
I know it ain't cool to say this now.
But I can't help the way I feel inside.
Around you I can be the way I am,
Be happy, pissed or sad.
But the things I always think about
Are the feelings we have shared.
Chorus: 'Cos when we are together there is something
That I have with you, trust!
And as we're growin' closer I can feel it
Flowing out from you, trust!
I hope you can feel the same way that I do, trust.
If there's one thing now between us that's a must, trust.
Look now, we can share emotion
Something that we both thought was just too tough,
Aggression, love and honesty,
There could never be enough.
All I wanna do is just let you know that I care,
And when things get too hard for you,
Look back and I'll be there.

You inspire me intensely
Without any doubt
You keep me thinking, help me try,
Show that I can do without,
With you there's more foundation,
More than any other time,
And when it comes to you my heart is true,
Until the day I die.

When you're hurtin' don't the time moves slow
Her soft warm fingers trace a tear along my cheek
She sure does make it hard to go
Her sweet lips softly whisper how much she wants me now
She's not at least too ashamed to let it show
And I feel her hand that tremble that's holdin' on to me
She sure does make it hard to go
Leaving her was the saddest thing I guess I'll ever do
The way I'm hurtin' only heaven knows
And knowing when I'm gone missing her will be much worse
That sure does make it hard to go

We know that it's the last time to ever meet like this
Don't it hurt to reep the seeds you sow
I'll hold her to me gently for just one more goodbye

To the Smithwicks and the Harp and the bottle, draught and keg.

How your man stayed up on the surfboard after 14 pints of stout.
I dreamt a dream the other night, jaysus I couldn't sleep a wink,
The rats were tryin' to count the sheep and I was tryin' to get off the drink.
There was footsteps in the parlour and voices on the stairs,
And I was climbin' up the walls and I was movin' round the chairs.
I looked out from under the blanket, and up at the fireplace,
There was the Pope and John F. Kennedy and Jack Charlton and the three of them were starin' in me face.
And suddenly it dawned at me, hey by God I think I'm getting the D.T.s,
When the Child o' Prague began to dance around the mantlepiece.
I went, goodbye to the port and brandy, to the vodka and the Stag,
To the Smithwicks and the Harp and the bottle, draught and keg.

I tell ya my heart was palpitatin', I was sure it was going to stop.
And thinkin' I was dyin' I gave my soul to God to keep,
And ten pounds to St. Anthony to help me find some sleep.
I fell into an awful nightmare, and got a dreadful shock.
When I dreamt there was no duty-free in the airport down in Knock.
II dreamt Ian Paisley was sayin' the rosary and Mother Theresa was taking the pill.
And Frank Patterson was out of his head be God and he was singin' Spancil Hill.
Goodbye to the port and brandy, to the vodka and the Stag,
To the Smithwicks and the Harp and the bottle, draught and keg.
As I sat lookin' up at the Guinness ad I could never figure out
How your man stayed up on the surfboard after 14 pints of stout.
I dreamt I was in ecstacy in Heaven and agony in Hell, I was bored in limbo,
And then I was in purgatory as well.
And there was original sins and venial sins,
And mortal by the score.
So I tied barbed wired around my underpants and I flagilated myself on the floor.
Then I dreamt I was in the confessional box and the auld Bishop said to me, he said,
""Any impure thoughts my child?"" - the fuckin' barbed wire was killing me!
And then I dreamt I was in the jacuzzi with that auld hoor in number 10,
And then I knew that I'd never ever, ever drink again.
I went, goodbye to the port and brandy, to the vodka and the Stag,
To the Smithwicks and the Harp and the bottle, draught and keg.
As I sat lookin' up at the Guinness ad I could never figure out
How your man stayed up on the surfboard after 14 pints of stout.",Folk

And in my heart I still feel - Real!
I'd rather die before I'd call it quits
Cos I can't feel the way that you feel
A commitment, that will remain inside
Just something I will never forget
Don't tell me, that it's just my pride,
A built in part of what's inside my head
I've sacrificed a lot and still feel strong - Still!
But odds were that it wouldn't last for long - Wrong!

People say I've changed, say I'm much different now

"On a Christmas cake day one Friday in August
In a bookshop in Charing Cross Road
I first set eyes on a girl and at once I did know
She had eyes like a poet and hair like a rainbow
Reflecting the lights that did glow
And the sadness she kept in her eyes
Struck my senses a blow
And so as by chance at the touch of a glance
We could find ourselves out in the road
With no crush of time to defeat us and no place to go
And I couldn't say how but the coffee bar crowd
Had appeared through the silence that broke
And she said, Oh my father's a judge in St Albans you know
Oh well, then perhaps I could help you
You know that St. Albans is miles away
And I've got a room in Swiss Cottage in which you could stay
She laughed, Oh I couldn't do that, for I've got
To be up in the morning you see
So I rang up to find out the first morning train she could take
And so in the gloom of a candlelit room
With spaghetti, two forks and a plate
She said, Oh I really would like to be free and escape
Oh well if it's like that
You don't have to go back
And you're perfectly welcome to stay
But I've not finished school yet
She said as she got into bed
And so as she slept and the pure morning crept
Through the windows to take her away
I thought you can't make people be what you want them to be
I could see my self nailed to a dormitory tale
Of a holiday night's escapade
And just yesterday she had seemed like a woman to me",Rock

And beat him wit it
He didn't see me wit it
And this is what I'ma do
Tie the crime to you

Indo sacks at my wack Sr. High School
But I told the Dean 'Bye fool.'

Shoot me to the left & shit
Cause my financial state was on defecit

Really didn't trip

A lot a rappers try frontin' on me
Bet they ain't got nuttin' on me
And ain't no way that buck can harm me

I swallow fools with no regurgitaion

When ya placed in my path.

I bust asses
Ya slow like molasses
As this continues
Then you know the fastest
Computing, looting, I gets the root of things
Bitches with problems
I leave ya jaw numb
I slap hoes
My rap flows along
With the flow of the song
As I flow on the bong
I use Jedi mind tricks
To find tricks
Bind tricks, tie them up
Then I try and phuck then they die
And what do I care?
I dare hoes
And prepare flows cause I never spare those lives
Who strives
With knives & slice
I parylize ya twice
With fear
Del is nice to your ears.

Not of hardest, artists going far
Jack off from Jupiter
Because I'm shooting for the stars
I'm a mack
Never come wack
Gimme a 30 second snippit
I'll rip it
Because the shit gets deeper
Creep ya ass as the floor rocks
We got the beat hittin' hard like four cops
Shorts out my last record
I write my rhymes nekkid
Let me give you a tip
I'm on the balls
So just expect it
My rep gets phatter thinkin' about those kids
They tried to step and got phucked like they momma did
By the Mr. Mostskill
I did ya hoe, still
She's askin' for waxin' and taxin' cause she heard a hoe squeal
Hoes I'm, getting more plays than Showtime
The demon got ya screamin' with no shine
No time for regular run of the the mill
I'm packin' with steel boy soldiers
Never no more the soul soldier.

So watch your back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't fuck about who the hardest
You lay where the people who mourn pray
Get your name etched in stones with your born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the glass, my mind starts packing this Louis Vuitton bag
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot going blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arms
Can't you see he got a piss bag
17 years old, and you niggas wonder why I'm so cold


Let me get a fifth of some brandy, a plate of some candy
Cindy, Sandy, Mindy Mandy
Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie
Man we, can't we all get along
Two shots of Patron, I did it till the break of dawn
Big fish in a pond, running my triathlon
Doggy Dogg keep the bone
One of a kind, blow you mind
Just like Einstein, born to shine
I'm getting mine prime time like 21
Get 'er done, everything in my life, I make it look like fun
Everyday of my life, I'm trying get my buzz on
Cuz on some other shit, I'm keeping it on the under bitch
So much pain I overcame, same thing
Me, E-40, and Game came from the same gang
But you wouldn't understand
I'm populating with my weeper's translation

"this is the dawning of the age of who knows best
and with each passing day i feel like i know less
they say somewhere in the world there's political unrest
but not as much as in my head
seems like this day will never end
too much confusion causing breakdowns
in the relationship that means so much to you and me
there are the kids who will always break out
out of the chains that keep them under lock and key
on their fucking knees
is this the first day or the last day of your life
is this the young idea that keeps you awake at night
fifteen minutes of talking hard equals fifteen minutes of pain
a lifetime with your closest friends is one never lived in vain
all this confusion won't cause a breakdown
in the relationship that means so much to you and me
we are the kids who will always break out
out of the chains that keep us under lock and key

"How sweet and happy seem, those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what repture sweet, my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
She used to pray that I, on Jesus would rely
And always walked the shining gospel way
So trusting still His love, I seek that home above
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day
If I could only hear my mother pray again
If I could only hear her tender voice as then
How happy I would be, t'would mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again
Within the old home place, her patient smiling face
Was always spreading comfort, hope and cheer
And when she used to sing to her eternal king
It was the songs the angels loved to hear
Her work on earth is done, the life crown has been won
And she will be at rest with Him above
And some glad morning she, I know will welcome me
To that eternal home of peace and love
If I could only hear my mother pray again
If I could only hear her tender voice as then
How happy I would be, t'would mean so much to me

Eyes closed, nothing more to say

A familiar name carved in ivory

Underneath this stone a truth so cruel
All so divine the scavenger awaits its prey

My own blood I let shed
My body so weak and sore
Waiting to be decomposed
Overwhelmed by this tragedy
Wrapped up in harmony

Feedback from those resting so wise

He put a ribbon on its head to make it cute
But it still looked like a chihuahua
He had me over to watch it sit and beg
It bit my knee, and made love to my leg

Whenever it's not peeing on my lawn

I wanted to exterminate it and all its kind

He puts his little pet in my forgiving hands

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may his His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

I want you to know

But I don't recommend it

I know you can't ignore
That I will die for you
And lay down my life for you
Girl I want to see
You standing next to me
Girl I apologize
For each and every lie

"I envision turbulence and murder since it's an everyday occurrence
It's 3030, yo, I get my hands dirty
They think they the pure breed, medically insured weed
Fuck the system, non-conformist humans
Walk around because of their ordinance, just ornaments
Super-thugs use computer bugs, all ignoramuses
Reduced to savage half-beasts off a crack piece
Not me, I'm shit-faced, which way but loose
In a hovercraft, not no bubble-bath, turbo-boost
Fuck Earth, I want to live on Mars so I'm closer to the stars
And farther away from dumb civilization with no mental stimulation
They changed the constitution for your red white and blue friends
Exterminate nuisance, no one listens to what you said
The online is touching your head
With brainwashing, with propaganda about your fearless leader
Who got two hundred bodyguards so you can't touch him either
Bodies disappear, obviously of fear
Lobbyists can't get near shit
Everybody's spirits are under control
Computers run with the soul
Elitists defeat us, they live by the beaches
Bubbledome over the hemisphere, so you can't enter here
We live in the dumps with mutant rodents
With blood red eyes, saliva drips for opponents
Scratch your ID chip off 'cause everybody own it
I envision turbulence and murder since it's an everyday occurrence 
They only teach high-tech in private portables
That float above commoners, they'd soon as bomb it first
Advanced safety features, from contact with creatures
Who either slave their lives away in outdated factories
Or may be bounty hunters in a land of apathy
I'm Butch Cassidy, style wild, uncontained
I steal computer disk files, drink water from drains
Metal detectors check ya, with reflectors in every sector
While I drink electric nectar
No one believes inspectors and spooks
They just lecture the youth about having respect and couth
Toward the US, and you guessed it
The rest get imprisoned or incisions in their medulla
No president, we have a ruler
""You are to be inside by 9 o'clock or we will shoot ya""
Missile launchers haunt ya in your nightmares
It ain't quite fair, little tykes ain't prepared
They've got your wife naked bare in the subway
For some thug play, neo-punks with cerebral pumps
For enhanced recognition of politicians and witches
Senior citizens are disposed against their wishes
Aliens landed and said our planet wasn't worth invadin
'cause all the natural resources are fadin

"You'll find there's more love in the arms you'll be leaving
Than all the good you'll ever find in goodbye

But lately they're gettin' harder to say

I know he's on your mind again today
I hold you close but it's never close enough
And I know that he's the reason why
You'll find there's more love...
Could it be you've been leaving without saying a word

Opportunities exist but often don't arise
And think of how it must have felt to watch you walk away and melt
I keep it all inside myself and in between my eyes
And it's no surprise what we've become
Since the arrival has begun
It hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright
I'm only concerned with the way we end up
I think I've been wrong enough to know when I'm right
So put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone
It hasn't been long enough
I feel as if I spoke too soon and ruined the whole afternoon
A feeling that we're more than doomed is creeping up inside
And good as it was bound to be there's something about you and me
It's negative in chemistry which makes it hard to hide
And it's no surprise when lights are falling
It's bound to re-awake some primal calling
It hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright

"based on the poem ""Tragediens Trone"" by John Henrik Svaren,
is translated by the undersigned,
and hereby dedicated to Kristoffer Garm Rygg
Hear!
From this day forth
are the heights of Horeb broken
and the sea of sulphur-ice.
And blasphemy!
in heaven's chambers:
Souls had fled their halls
and closed was the book of life.
And behold!
The great, white throne:
black
with sacred blood
Our father -
Dead by his own hands:
an epitaph
worthy no king.
And so is everything
a nameless lie.
Who, my god,
am I?
Man knows me
as Lucifer, the serpent of old.
The wretched hold my banner high.
Your gift
- all life! -
I grant a grave
Yet I am not your death.
Come carry forth the crown
to your once held throne.
Here is where my suffering should cease
- but alas; I am crowned
in grief unheard of!
In this lone monarchy
- without a friend of foe -
I greet the mourning sun
with strife and a song:
Please speak my name!
And leave me not
in the dust of death.
I am weighed down
beneath the tragedy crown, -
nameless,
and alone,
a fatherless son.

"Sitting alone in an old rockin' chair
I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who should care
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
Her hands were caloused and wrinkled and old
A life of hard work was the story they told
And I've thought of angels as I saw her there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
Bless her old heart do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry the cross that is more than her share
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
It wouldn't take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
I know some kids in an orphan's home
Who think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
I look at her and I think what a shame
The ones who forgot her she loves just the same
And I think of angels as I see her there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair",Country
"Come, take my hand, let's jump through the knot of the past
From the night where phantoms touch and tangle further, deeper as the day is closing in
Soft and fragile, there is grace in the dead of silence
As we drink gentle hands are shaping further, higher as the new day enters
Won't the mind run far away, way ahead of us,
And everything that will be and for us here and now
The old and the poor, from the way we hadn't seen before,
And the reality that shields us and clothes us makes us happy for things the day can offer",Indie

Mi tiempo se acaba, desesperacion

And we still put it down nigga even though we four strong
Flesh gone come home, Bone gone stay Bone
When the 5th Dawg gets loose it gone be on


It's the original bang bang and I don't give a f**k about none
of these muthaf**kas
Still get down foe my damn thang
Tell a nigga that I concentrate come on down to the land let us

People lookin at me like he's too nasty to date
Gimme my dick back we in the last days every second got a
muthaf**ka passin away
Fast to the bass that we fell wit the jazz and ah 
In a mask at my home with no men in a mansion to get a little
piece of this American dream
I spit venom thru the pipes as I smoke in em

It smell good and the weed still sell good for the lay bits
Talkin bad like you ready to blaze nigga you ain't mad

I give a f**k who you ridin with or that nigga that you slidin

He ain't a killa he just somebody to vibe with
Somebody tell this nigga motha who he died with
So silly!! 
Pumped up Big Willy I don't really think he really

Hit him with the crossbow monto-mental little lost soul

And a sharp looking agent who
Wants to find me certified dead

She's an infidel zombie
She gets depressed with duress
A love that cannot find me

I don't believe it
There's a bullet with my name on it now
They caught me once while I was out messin around
They put me in cemented wedges but I didn't drown
I'm back on the streets and running for my life again

From behind your bedroom shade
Are you ready to give way
You're running low on sympathy
From a space just out of reach
In a comfortable misery
Your foundation has been shaken
So you got a story no one else can claim
No more waiting, no more warning
Somethin's gotta change
You're hiding out from all your friends
There are no words they can send
Nothing you have interest in
You're hoping for a chance to cheat

I let go of the light

To the blackness I fell,

And alone with the memories of the dead
Every single step I fear to take
No light at all and no end in sight,
I must find my way
I must find my way
Now that I'm living here
And there's nowhere to go,
Speaking to me are memories of the dead
How to cope and endure
And survive all of this
I must listen to memories of the dead
In this place I must control my fear
By myself I must learn to be comfortable in darkness
To be comfortable in darkness
Is this darkness within and is life just the one
Is all of this in my head?
If it is I can choose
What I think, what I feel
These things I fear are only real in my head
Now I found the choices I can make
I choose to rule my fear and not to break
I will master my own darkness
There is no step that I now fear to take
The world within me, is mine to create
My fate is in my own hands
Now I understand
How it can be, how I can see, how I can find a way
To be comfortable in darkness
To be comfortable in darkness

In the face when you place ya hands on her ass
In class, and give a spank a banka full of fun at recess and be fresh""
Okay, I'll try it and die if she does but she did
And turned around and socked me like Rocky
I feel like a heel for real but now I'm older
And told ya to keel over 'cause now it's different
No innocence and women sprints the way
You sway to the forces of evil
And we will bust that ass fast and quickly

Mack you and attack you

Ya crew is on a mission every weekend
Freakin' and kissin' with other van ya man
Let's turn the sands in the hourglass
And your power lasts less and guess
And take a gander I slander ya name
And spread propaganda
And I demand ya ta stop
Hop on a train before pain'll be ya middle name
In the game of love and happiness
Yes, I caressed ya flesh but if you test
Ya caught out there without a vest
Mess around and you can rest
I found a new boo boo
Baby, maybe I can crave the one
That saves thee reputation, ya'll let's face it
Ya basin', smokin', leavin' niggas broken and open
But I scope in to ya brain gain and remain
And clues ya use for protection now who's next in

Woke up in a random room
I think I woke up too soon
I confess
That this world don't feel like mine

Strangers to this room

But I know life's not lived with ease
So get off your dirty knees
And wake up

When the body goes the soul may also die
So are we hanging on
To anything at all?
If there's nothing to hold but faith
There's nothing to do but fall
I can't relate
I'm too fucked up to understand
But I can offer you my hand
So hold on
Cause there is no master plan
Is it possible that God was born of man?
Don't be afraid to live
For everything you're worth
Everything you are is yours
From the day you're born to Earth
I'm awake
And I am all I need to be
And I am nothing if I'm not free

Watching fires burn from smoke to black
There's nothing she won't burn
From Styrofoam to urns, to someone else's ashes in a sack
You can scorch the metal, you can even melt the glass
You can pass the time here, fire lives into the past
An all-consuming flame, that refines and new begins
It'll take your family heirlooms,
But it can take your darkest sins
It's a good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die
And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes
Condemn their sons to Hades
And Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well
But there ain't no hell for a fire-watcher's daughter
We exercise the demons of the things we used to know
The gnashing of the teeth become the remnants of our homes
We think we're moving on, from materials we long
To forget we ever sold our souls to own
There's a chilling absolution that we're given from our birth
A powerful delusion and a plague upon the earth
But nothing scares me more
Than the stranger at my door
Who I fail to give shelter, time, and worth
Let the good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die
And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes
Condemn their sons to Hades

"It's not the weather, to wear no sweater..

Sometimes she changed like the weather
But no one loved me better
I'll never ever forget her
My brand new sweater
Nobody got her wetter
She told me in her letter
I bought her food and fed her
My brand new sweater

Pee Wee? He went down to Montgomery Wards
Howzabouta Money-be	? He went down to K-Mart
Yo, Humpty! I challenge you to a game of dominoes
A game of dominoooess

I've been sporting sweaters ever since I was a child
But nowadays sweaters kind of cramp my style
Cause up around the collar they be getting me hot
Believe it or not, my sweater used to the shot
The freak of my nature, my sweet, stick thing
But like George of the Jungle she had trouble with the swing

Yeah, brah, she couldn't hack it
Started cock-blocking like a full metal jacket
Fingers did the walking, calling, tying up my phone
Boo had me under heavy surveillance at my home
Word to Mac Mone, suffocated my bone
Pulling on my hoodie in a nagging little tone
Where you going? Where you been? Who's Kim? Who's Felicia?
But I don't see no ring, I never met the preacher
I got to play you out, I mean the loving was phat
But you're a sweater, riding so heavy on my back

She wore a lot of leather
Baby, drove a jetta
I never used to sweat her
Yeah, but that upset her
No-one got her wetter
She told me in her letter
I'll never ever forget her
My brand new sweater

I got a brand new sweater
But I didn't get it from Mervyn's
Her friends be pulling wool but
My syringe pulls bull from the lens
Even then, I'll send you back for a refund
Plus she sport a good hat-terin 
That'd have been the end
If I let the sweater lay upon my skin
Great Scott, time for a rebate sale
We make mail, more than you think
As long as they're strong
And the cotton don't shrink
We can spend doe on a jane doe
Cause hoe got to have clothes, so
I buy the thread and let them weave
Leave it alone if you don't want to get worn out
I've got legions of sweaters for the seasons
I got blue when I'm sad, red when I'm mad
Pink cause I'm ticklish
When I'm being laid in green
When I'm getting paid
I don't have a problem if you want to jock me
See cause, gs is what you're gonna clock me
Go ahead, knock me if you think I'm not shit
But when it comes to sweaters?
Saafir's a perfect fit

Her cheese smelt like cheddar
She let me use the credit
Yeah, but just forget it

We creepin' in too, baby
We got five on that thing, man
We got, uh, Dru Down
We got the Luniz

Yeah, Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1
You say you got five on my tenda
You can bend over the table
But be sure bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brush?
No elementary school ground plan
Not a five dollar bill
But five double zero on the real, feel
I'm on the level, stair mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high speed
But still don't tap the B.B.s
I'm dizzy, Dru Down, baby
Like Nyquil, I drop fever, so either put your five up
Or ya gots to leave it like beaver 'cause see ya
Nigge Perk land broke and smoke ya spliff all day
Go home and buy big tricky with his pretty Impala
I got five on the Hennessey, Segrims and 40's
Cause this is how we do it like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland city, framed nigge is a gonna
Now I'm blowin' it up like Oklahoma
Put ya five with my fin, best believe we'll bend
Mo corners than you thought, to somethin' writers bought
More sizz-acks, believe that talkin', where you from?
Oakland
Smokin' in attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy, the whole town loves me
An every event I'm sacked up
So if ya need me, scream double R when ya see me
I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed
I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back
I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack
E-40, why ya treat me so bad?
40 makes it happen, fives gets slapped
And rubbin' them girls just a little bit of light weight
Flamboyant, potent fumes lingerin' mighty clouds and molten lights
You expect to bit the baron an you'll be violatin' my civil rights
I'm startin' to feel my scrilla but perhaps today my scrilla ain't feelin' me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools three
Pockets empty, pitchin' five, man I'm dusted took off my hat
Passed it around, sprinkle me
Me an E-40 to the head, comin' fifth, plus
You let the lead bust, ready to do a murda, man?
Curved off the Hurricane, hurled again
Witness we'll bein' off two-fifths equal
Killing people like Jason, facin' death every sequel

Bring the pain like Method neglected
Smokin' crips to the night to the brains for breakfast
'Cause for the indo fins do the evil that men do
Give me five and I shall proceed and continue
I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed
I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back
I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack
Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around heard young genome said, ""I've gotta be down""
'Cause new styles is goin' down, look around you
Tunes from the Luniz spread round an round you
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still brinin' satin for them draws
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the 'cause
Rollin' up the cannabis, hittin' the Mary Jane
Smokin' the five before it's twelve o'clock
Sippin' on Hurricane, ready to smoke on the indo
Rollin' up my window, fittin' to go to the land
With a hand fulla broccoli
When it comes to the sticky, I'm the man
Crunch nasty, I be hittin' the jank so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke THC ain't no joke
I got five on everything, let's get loaded and smoke
S P I C E about to hit it an croak
I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed

"There ain't no reason things are this way
It's how they've always been and they intend to stay
I can't explain why we live this way
We do it every day
Preachers on the podiums speaking of saints
Prophets on the sidewalk begging for change
Old ladies laughing from the fire escape
Cursing my name
I got a basket full of lemons and they all taste the same
A window and a pigeon with a broken wing
You could spend your whole life working for something
Just to have it taken away
People walk around pushing back their debts
Wearing paychecks like necklaces and bracelets
Talking about nothing, not thinking 'bout death
Every little heartbeat, every little breath
People walk a tight rope on a razors edge
Carrying their hurt and hatred and weapons
It could be a bomb, or a bullet or a pen
Or thought, or a word or a sentence
There ain't no reason things are this way
It's how they've always been and they intend to stay
I don't know why I say the things I say
But I say them anyway
But love will come, set me free
Love will come, set me free, I do believe
Love will come, set me free, I know it will
Love will come, set me free, yes
Prison walls still standing tall
Some things never change at all
Keep on building prisons, gonna fill them all
Keep on building bombs, gonna drop them all
Working your fingers bare to the bone
Breaking your back, make you sell your soul
Like a lung, it's filled with cold
Suffocating slow
The wind blows wild and I may move
The politicians lie and I am not a fool
You don't need no razor or a three piece suit
To argue the truth
They air on my skin in the world under my toes
Slavery stitched to the fabric of my clothes
Chaos and commotion wherever I go
Love I try to follow
Love will come, set me free
Love will come, set me free, I do believe
Love will come, set me free, I know it will
Love will come, set me free, yes

I wrap my fleshless arms around her
Come - the thaw, come within
Come, my love - and melt around me.
She buried me I dropped my wish
And now as love's true ghost lies dying
I'll raise my fist and victory
Never allow this pain, its clutches into me.
Hollowed dreams hollowed earth crumbling drive
We turn around step away and watch it all run down
forcibly we make these dreams into something real
a shattered cast a blackened mast a hail hung high in waning life
dancing wish and melting kiss I wrap my fleshless arms around her
kicking dusted dreams into the air I've come I've died I've won
come the thaw- come within- come my love- and melt around me.

"Sometimes in fond mem'ry my thoughts go back to the old country church
That I attened as a boy
You know it's kinda funny how we cling to old bygone days and bygone places isn't it
Why it seems like only yesterday that my mother took my childish hand in hers
And led me slowly down that long winding path to hear the word of God
And I seem to sense his presence more strongly there than anyplace I've ever known
There with the singin' of the birds and the humming of the bees
I knew that God was surely there
I knew it just as sure as if he'd laid his hand on my shoulder
And said welcome to my house son
Ah but years have passed and times has brought many heartaches and many tears
I've seen my mother pass onto the great beyond and many loved ones have followed
And I'd seen them go with dispairing hearts and tear dimmed eyes
And now in later days as I stroll along
The grassy footpaths to the old country churchyard
And I view the final resting place of my departed kin
I'm consoled by the thought that their sleep is a happy one
There in the place where God and men are one
And once again I seem to hear the voice of our gentle shepher saing
Welcome welcome to my house my son
Precious years with memory...",Country

"Words by Grian MacGregor
Music by Jay Ungar
The sun is sinking low in the sky above Ashokan.
The pines and the willows know soon we will part.
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken,
And a love that will always remain in my heart.
My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter,
The magic of moving as one,
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done.
Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?
Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping
Over the lake the stars shine.
They wonder if you and I will be keeping
The magic and music, or leave them behind.

The choices that you made
The prices that you've paid
Was it all worth it in the end?
When all is said and all is done
Where will you run to now?
The glory days are over
Your words are hollow
The vision you once had disappeared
So follow along to the path you have chosen for yourself
No one will listen to you now
Your time has run out
Everything I ever wanted you to know
I can just sit back and tell you now
Over the years we were so close, but you are dead to me now
You are dead to me
Over the years your time has run out
Over the years you've become dead to me
Everything I ever wanted you to know
I can just sit back and tell you now

Thangs can get rough, when you live in the ghetto
You gotta survive, no matter the pain
Nigga be hurting, life'll be hurting
But nigga for certain, this is the game
Man don't let them win, never let the system think they got you
If you relentless they can't stop you let em hang, they gone watch you
Yeah we the enemies of the world, won't let no territories homie
You got to get up, get out and get something, that's what they told me
Back in the days didn't have a pot to piss, went to throw it at em
Now I'm balling doing my damn thang, laughing at them dollars
Holla holla, if you hear me shorty, I'ma live everyday
Like it's my last, only the winner gone get the glory
What you thought I play for keeps
Put it down wicked in these streets
Heavily armored with the heat
Just in case a nigga want some beef
Being broke I know the feeling, that's why I'm paper chasing this cash
Better be smart and keep a stash, never know how long it's gone last
You do the math, hustling niggas multiply like mountains
Bone Thugs, Little Layzie 30 million and counting, come on

Money money, the mighty dolla dolla
Got to get my grind on, grind on, grind on
I don't want to be broke no more

You ain't worthy, none of you niggas could stop me
And none of you niggas could hurt me
If worse come to worse, I'ma get down and dirty
Though the Ouija can't curse me, NWA
Eazy E, that's the nigga that birthed me, hey
Thug style motherfucker, live forget ends
I'd never testify, Satan can't divide my piers
No weakness inside my fears
Drop tears, for niggas that died
I'm gonna safe divide, mind gone
And I think I'm running out of time
The god damn baby's daddy
And I'm gonna damned to hell, if I don't abide
and that's why I yell, B-E-N-Z we ride
Straight to the corner, down to the side
In the B-E-N-Z we
Roll around the corner with the F-O-R-T
S-C-V, and a nigga can't fuck with me
Not even the devil with B-O-N-E
T-H-U-G spell it motherfucker


Scandalous, straight up out of the hood type nigga
Stick up's, robberies, do we did gives a fuck nigga
See all ways to money so we mashing, we dashing
Get paid around parting give me twist a thug and I get up, in that ass
I'm here to get that money keep it coming, show me love
We made this, gotta get mine want to slip, it's about mine
It's harder to get, I'm serious not playing that's the pay wits
The streets have come back, real fast on that ass feel me
Cause I don't want to be broke no more
Standing in front of the liquor store with rocks no more
Cause my man, never had nothing to done that
It's like reversing time on my mind I can't go back, fuck that


I came up a nigga that never had nothing but hard times
I was always grinding, and talking up out of the hood
Into the bullshit, but I'm surviving
I got to get me some money man, put it down for the General
A nigga'd rob your ass, if I caught a nigga flossing cash
What it was four niggas, and we punk niggas
But you no niggas got us scared, a couple more green
To get up for everything reach the scene, clean
And we was the niggas that stood on the block
With a couple of rocks and a glock with the cops
Can't nobody have the nuts to say our name
They call me the Dummy Man
I'm sell him a fat twenty piece and then I reach for the bomb
The things they get awfully man
want to see what I put them shit come
Took em for they last dollar, holla
Man I ain't giving a fuck it's do or die
So get on the ground, lay it down
Give me some money my nigga POW
I ain't waiting I need it NOW
Ain't too much changed
I'm still on the grind in deuce double O deuce
I'm just a little more serious
Bout my reefer and my dough
Show me the money


Let me hear you say make money, money
Make money money, make it
Let me hear you say take money, money

While we're still in the club, show your pussy love

Open up wide, lemme show you what's it made for
Uh, like a finger, like a donkey
Lemme see you play, play with your monkey

"The best things in life are not free
But you don't need to have money
To get the things that you want to own
You just have to get a loan
When you buy, small or large
Just put it on your credit card
You can live like a king
Not paying for a single thing
Put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Every night, I pray and thank
God above for creating the banks
They have been so kind to me
With their boundless generosity
If you cannot make your payments
Well, do like the national governments
You can pay off what you owe
By taking out a bigger loan
Ya gotta put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Now I seem to have men after me
From the collection agency
And the bank came by the other day
Took everything I own away
Now I think that it is plain to see
That I must declare bankruptcy
But things aren't really all that bad
I can borrow from my dad!
And put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Ya gotta put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store",Folk

The creeping fears yeah we are them
So put your face on you ball of phlegm
We're the dark street at two am

We're the dark horse this is the race
Slow night in a desolate city
We are lions in a cage
Pet tigers fueled on rage
We're the moonlight we're the clouds
We are losers, we are proud
We are magic we are class
A hand with knuckles made of brass
We are good times, turned bad
We are the action you never had
Turn the heat up on my soul
Turn it up cause I'm feeling so cold
Slow night in a desolate city
And it hits like a slap in the face
We're the dark horse this is the race
Slow night in a desolate city

We are the sunlight we are the storm
We're the idea and the form
We are loving we are rape
We are magic caught on tape
We are splinters from a glass
We're the greatest we suck ass
We're united and torn apart
We are the ending - and the start
So turn the heat up cause I'm feeling so cold
Turn it up till it burns my soul
Turn the heat up on my soul
Turn it up cause I'm feeling so cold
Slow night in a desolate city
And it hits me like a slap in the face
You're the dark horse I am the race
Slow night in a desolate city

The pepper-box bell blowing my brains
But I made it go quicker with Spanish cocaine
And I looked at the cows and I made solemn vows

Well I made them, I made them
And who's knocking on my door?

I won't stop 'till I succeed

The system is flawed
It's time to take it to the street
I won't take the fall
Wanna leave 'em with no trace

Yo wake up it's the D crew up in here with the Black Spooks

Fool get a clue get a clue get a clue.
Now everybody want to tell everybody who to be with
Really doesn't matter to me long as I miss that H I V shit
And AIDS ain't the end of the world girls and us do kinky stuff
And there's way to muff without the fluids touchin
Never hide the truth if my body and hair is sacred
Then why we can't be naked in public
It's totally natural like sex is but this is
A law that had to be made by men with itty bitty penises
The streets of this world they are my playground I explore them
Meet somebody I don't like and I ignore them I don't destroy them
They way that you know who be he want me to hate like he hate
But I got too much m poopoo doo with me

People gonna always lay with who they want to lay with

It don't matter what another man say
I'm gone still do it all my way
Cause I'm slick like see-Bo's quick
I don't want to be down with yo gross click
I just want to snap photo flicks
With a freaky little trick puffin dodo sticks
I can live foul as dirt road hicks
I can make three plus two make six
Cut with verbal scrapes and nicks
I'm as ill as chicks with dicks
Scuff my kicks I'm bustin licks
Openin somebody up like Vicks
Purchase ism by the bricks
Plus I brick city hoes I picks
All in yo mix as I ease betwixt
Like sitcom vix be greasin dicks
I be skeezin chicks when the season switch
I be makin tricks itch like fleas and ticks
I swoop low and prey on tricks
Large I've got my own prefix
I'll stop twitchin where's my fixer
I gonna break shit up like Twix

Allergic to suckas and bustas and get to sneezin' and shit

You with the dark eyes and palest of skin
Tonight I am going from Santa Maria
Wait for me till I'm in your arms once again""
She held me, she kissed me, begged me not to leave her
To cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win
But a letter now tells me she died of a fever
I'll never see her in this world again
You are my sorrow, you are my splendor
You are my shelter through storm and through strife
You are the one I will always remember
All off the days of my life
I curse the ambition that took me far from her
For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair
She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me
Behold I am with you wherever you are""
I can still hear him. he calls to me only
What once was begotten shall come to no end
But the road is so long and the nights are so lonely
My soul just to hold him in this world again
You are my sorrow, you are my splendor
You are my shelter through storm and through strife

Don't have to be a soldier, stand down

Is it a dream, is it a nightmare
Or is it a competition and if it is
What if we don't fight fair?
What's bald in the morning
But in the evening has white hairs?
What's the cause of global warming
And could it be these things right here?

Anyone for another light year
Got a hit-list and a cloud of
Witnesses which is pricier
Well, my tears are mightier
Than my fears so mighty Earth
Provides me hurt that I keep buried
Until I convert it to writing
I was wounded, I was injured
I was made to move to Denver
I was taken through a new adventure
Paint stripped from it's first fixture
I was placed in another picture
I was rushed to a new landscape
And ripped away from family
Scraped into a politician's mistake
And what's left of talents in chests beneath oceans
Welled up behind eyelids has yet to be salvaged
A world of emotions, a guess that it might be okay
That it could be all right if expressed
Today you don't have to be a soldier
Don't have to be a soldier, stand down
It's okay to be as you were
Be as you were again
Am I a woman raised man-machine
Damaging everything I touch?
By not caring enough
Or too much?
Am I far flung fantasy
Setting free enmity?
And making friends from enemies
And bridges for the in-betweens
For the highwayman on the low road
The tired back with a large load
The trials spanned till I found hope
And I found more when I slo-mo'ed
Enough of the back to face front
Let those in the pack of the race run
I'm needing an evener pace one
Too hasty makes mistakes
Can you carry a song as strong as your arms
Can bear that you keep from harm?
And it will be there when you go wrong
Make a heart from your bond, your treasure's right here
And what's left of talents in chests beneath oceans
Welled up behind eyelids has yet to be salvaged
A world of emotions, a guess that it might be okay
That it could be all right if expressed today

Moon, should I try to hide

"Nothing comes during a sleep above a dream,
You better wake up and face reality,
You never get ahead just laying around in bed,
What you can see you really can achieve.
Dream means a sleepless fulfillment though I wonder why,
You wake up out of the darkness and let life begin,
Oh dream means a sleepless fulfillment oh I wonder when,
Wake up out of the darkness and let life begin.
Some people are living only on hopes and dreams,
But you've got to wake up to the plans and scenes,
The journey of life is only one step ahead,
But you never get there tossing and turning in bed,
You're facing the world with no plans for tomorrow,
And now you're wondering what's waiting around the bend.
Dream means a sleepless fulfillment unless you try,
Sleepers, they hold on t dreams while the world passes by,
Dream means a sleepless fulfillment  unless you try,
Sleepers, they hold on to dreams while the world passes by.
Dream means a sleepless fulfillment though I wonder why,
Sleepers hold on to dreams while the world passes by, one more time,

Plus I'm doing my thang
On the side
We won't let it ride
Nigga don't hide
Landlord innovator
Switch lanes no indicator
The general, cash generator
Master and savior
Nigga stay massive in nature
When tooth shatter ya die bone
In the savage cyclone of cops, sirens, and cases
Who read the bible for basics?
When I'm crooked eye with rivals
Horizontal in god's places
Suspicious of all
Now who dat?
Quick on the draw
Lick a paw
For loved ones blood runs cold in the winter wars
Check the criminal thoughts
Villains warp with the invisible force
Know the ledge
Stay focused like photo lens
And spread wings like cobra heads
Till I'm old and dead
Hot shit, toxic
You know we blocks shit
Traffic in the streets system
All in your jeep knocks shit
Julio for no reason back the fifth
And he cocks it
Rock shit, we make niggas mad
And wanna pop shit
Massive and attractive
Niggas is captive
Chemotherapy needed

When I hit hard
It get my dick hard
In my backyard
Analyze the stars
On how to defeat all odds
In a new zone
I'm on a new phone
Make most of the wackest rapper niggas
Wanna find a new home
Like rasco jeans
My style flip two-tone
Pass my blue chrome
Here's one of the best of busta rhymes own
My debut made you
Wonder who
Shit blazes so much
You wish you could play out
So you could blaze, too
Before I shout you
Or give reason to doubt you
I study shit and re-analyze everything about you
My rhymes on the preserve
Niggas know we deserve
Everything up in your stash and in the reserve
Fuck that!
Hook up all my lyrics on the echos and the re-verbs
Never fuck with these herbs
My squad remains superb
 walkin' through the streets
Undercovers follow us, stress
Muthafuckas on the regular to bust
Trust us
We don't get enough
Nigga wha-what?
Dirty baggy jeans
Black napsack with something for ya gut
Wooly-type skully
Fully strapped, black bulletproof, and match
Quick,
Whip up a batch
Of bullets to blow up the map
Shit
Collapse, perhaps doing this in the raps
In the long time, ya trapped
Buck make em react
God verse attack
Let em know the moon is still black
And it's a fact

"As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playin'
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start
Most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels

Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong",Country

goes she feels rejected miscommunication is expected
She's crying for direction lost in her reflection all the while pretending she's alive she's trying not
to show it but everybody knows it but something is just killing her inside
Like a recall on your television screen she was someone you would never want to see and things never
worked out the way she planned every drop of blood she had is on your hands

Maybe someday soon when she's alone she'll decide to take a life that's not her own lying on the ground
beside her gun never knowing she's not the only one all she ever needed was a voice telling her that she
could make a different choice now is not the time cause it's too late what good is god doing you when he
is only faith?

days is our bond. And with the sound of beauty I became silent. And with these sounds
a wave of relief flows through me hitting ma heart. From there my power of my love

"This evening the moon dreams more lazily
As some fair woman, lost in cushions deep
With gentle hand caresses listlessly
The contour of her breasts before she sleeps
On velvet backs of avalanches soft
She often lies enraptured as she dies
And gazes on white visions aloft
Which like a blossoming to heaven rise
When sometimes on this globe, in indolence
She lets a secret tear drop down, by chance
A poet, set against oblivion
Takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear
This opal drop where rainbow hues appear
And hides it in his breast far from the sun",Folk

He'll drop you where you stand
Lift the roof with his bare hands
and hand you down his just demands
as you huddle in your tiny corner
The door-to-door inspector now sits to eat his lunch
He scowls at last week's paper
in the worker's cafe, hushed
You made your choice whan mocking the ways of true grown men
Now may your woman-love protect you
as you face this grevious punishment you've earned
He'll drop you where you stand
then journey home to wash those hands
and to his bed he'll trembling go

Can he truly tell
Can he say he knows my name
Does he know who to blame
Can he see behind his mask
Does he know his task
Does he fear the life he leads
Will he walk where I do not know
A place I'd like to see and show
To view the world far and wide
A place where he can replace his long lost life
Do we see the thousand tears
he has shed through all his troubled years
The times that he was left alone
Never to see what he had been show
Is all he has enough to last

"Who is this, trapped inside of me?
An unfamiliar, violent breed
Raping innocence, vestal mutilation
Razor seduction, slicing devastation
My body twists and turns from the agony
My lungs scream as the air is drained
And with the scars as my witness
My arms are maimed
Carnal betrayal, flesh abuse
Bloodloss... And my mind's confused
Torn between decisions
Made between incisions
Malediction murder
Suicidal law
Afflictions choir
I draw the shortest straw
But suddenly I came to clarity
About the black beast inside of me
Contorted through submission
It took life to a higher position
I've felt the black light
Shining with strongest might
Guiding to the homicidal paths
And to unleash ungodly wrath
I've seen the black light
Blinding with strongest might
Showing me the homicidal way
As I slowly become its slave
..The price all must pay
There must be no mercy for the
insignificant and weak
It's no tragedy that all this misery must
be cleansed through me
Malediction murder
Homicidal law
Afflictions choir
You'll draw the shortest straw
Malediction murder
Genocidal law
Afflictions choir
Man will draw the shortest straw
When it all crashes down
Death is triumphant and wears its crown
And my work is done
Suicidal law... Yet I have won

"Hey, we got a job outta the way--
from Salt Lake City to San Francisco overnight.
Been a long drive, man--
ain't nothing to do.
We was bored of all the waitin'.
Me and Bill was up in the front,
I said, ""Man is that a UFO?""
He said, ""I think it is.
I think there's two of 'em.""
I said, ""Man, is that place Mustang Ranch on the way?""
He said, ""Yeah, let's call 'em up.""
Called the girl up on the phone
She said ""Hello?""
I said, ""How much would it be
for me to come over and get my-- my-- my--
...My ham glazed?""
She said,
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyy...
""Our price is love, baby--
You jus' gon' have to come here and see.""
We rolled up in there
'round 7 o'clock in the mornin'.
See a big ol' fat dude comin' up,
comin' around the corner with a gun on his hip.
He said, ""What y'all want?""
""We just tryin' to come o'er here an' get our ham roasted.""
He said, ""I need to see some ID.""
Showed him my ID--
He got up in the van.
An' Dagwood back there sleepin' like he always is.
Dude put his flashlight in his face,
Dagwood woke up an' said ""What's goin' on?""
He said,
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyy...
""Gonna need some ID, boys.
You gon' come in here an messin' with my girls.""
Went up in there,
and two big ol' fat girls come on,
sitting on both sides of me.
They say, ""What's up, baby?""
I said, ""Nuh, what's going on with y'all?""
They say, ""Whatchu want?""
I said, ""I just want my ham to get glazed.""
She said, ""Well c'mon here in the back,
let's talk about it.""
She said, ""You need a threesome.""
I said, ""I need-- it only take one
to get my ham glazed.""
She said, ""How much money you got?""
I said ''Bout twenty dollars.""
She said,
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
""You gonna need more than that, boy.
I ain't no damn street walker.""
Gonna rock that Ranch, baby.
Gets in the way you breathe.
Now Bill got the finest one in the house.
She came out the back all in her underwear,
lookin' fine and he was jealous.
She took him by the hand,
and he went back to the jungle room.
And his teeth were chattin',
And he was sweating bullets,
Cause he was so damn scared.
And she sat him down on the couch
Put her hand on his leg.
And said ""Whatchu wanna do to me""
He said, ""I want my ham to be glazed.""
She said, ""How much money you got?""
He said, ""Twenty dollars.""
She said,
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyy...
""You gonna need more than that, boy.
Thinkin' that you been gonna get with me.""

"She was sitting on a stool in a little bar
Called the Seldom Seen
When I walked over and said, ""Hi"", introduced myself
""And what's your name?"", I asked, she just smiled
She was wearin' a tiny gold chain
With the initials SS on the front
And I said, ""Wait a minute you are Susie Smith?""
She shook her head
""kay, you're Sally Simpson, Sarah?""
And before I could finish she put her hand on mine
And said, ""Look it's not important.""
And I said, ""Okay, I'll just call you Double S.""
And she nodded
And I said, ""What are you drinkin' Double S?""
She said, ""Scotch'n'Soda.""
And I said, ""Okay Double S one Scotch'n'Soda comin' up.""
""You live around here?"", I asked
""No she said just killin' time till the morning.""
""I got an early plane back to California.""
""I live near San Simeon.""
""Oh, and you'll be flyin' on a 7-0-7 no doubt?"", I said
""How did you know?"" she asked
""Oh, I guess I'm just super-smart.""
""You gonna spend the rest of the night in this bar Double S?""
""No,"" she said,
""I have a motel room I'm at the Surfing Sand.""
""Can I give you a lift?""
""Thanks, I rented a car but I don't drive it too well.""
She answered
""It's a stick-shift, haha
""Double S you are something-special."", I said.
And paid the man and we walked out
In the cool evening breeze.
She slid across the seat and snuggled up close to my side
And I began to run my fingers through her hair
It was soft'n'silky. I opened the door to her room
My lips found her lips and I held her close
And whispered, ''You are a super-sexy lady
She simply smiled.
I could feel her body slowly soften as her sensuous soul
Swiftly swept me into sublime serenity
Her plane left just as the morning sun
Began to softly streak the starry sky
She kissed me a soft so long, waved a sultry
So long from the window
And I never saw Double S again
Right now she's soaring somewhere above the clouds
And I'm walking home on one
And I just realized I never did find out
What Double S stood for
All I know is our time together was short and sweet...",Country

"I'm starting to believe that there's a god and he hates me.
I'm starting to believe that my mom lied about grace and divinity,
And it hurts like a sunburn,
Wakes me up from a deep sleep.
I parked on the street out in front of St. Mary's.
I watched people leave, from the mass in the evening.
With my windows down, I can still hear the gospel choir singing.
I stayed in the car, and the light from the stained-glass window didn't reach me.
The cicadas are deafening,
Their voices caught in the breeze.
You're not walking next to me.
All alone is all I'll ever be.
You're not walking next to me.

It's not a diss nigga dont catch feelins//
I'll pull out the pen d.o.c. gave me a kill it//

And this bitch from da Big Pimpin video starts to blow me //
In the phantom,I start to fantasize//
This shit get thicker than bitches in Atlanta thighs//
It's suicide.. if you think you could fuck with the seven time platinum driver of that land rover truck//

Half these rap niggas wiping they tears//
The other half wonderin how the fuck Game got here//
I took some weed up to frisco, came back with a demo
Drove to dre's studio came back in a limo//
It was that simple//
The crystal bottles and the bitches came later
And so did the haters//
As the doc turns the nob on fader//
And i turned the tv cause im tired of watchin the raiders//
Fast forward then Shaq gettin traded//
Then fast forward again the Shaq gettin traded//
And fuck all the time that was wasted//
Beefin with these wack niggas had me lost in the matrix//
If i wanted the crown I would just take it//
Put this 38. to yo dome bitch and just take it//
Im the music and its time to face it//
You niggas so fuckin pussy i can taste it//

"How he knows every wretch's death
None of them are crystal believers
They all shiver under fate's icy breath
But turn their face to the seeming deceiver
Alarm to all the foul aberrations
Who feed off the disgust of the masses
All joined together to make a scrap of a living
The eye sees all, the eye says so
Off the foul gasping breath of those who are paying
He says all and he says so
Behold, their defective bodies in wonder
The creeps and whores, the wicker and deformed
Amazement paints the faces in the rickety bleachers
They scream for more of the modern horror
Such much as still the eyes of the happy
And burn us all away in the light life
Only the one knows the awful end
A justified torturous completion
Of all their wrong doings and black sins
Forcasted in crystal visions
Slouched over the clear seeing eye
He marks down each death and he quivers
How he knows every wretch's death
And none of them are crystal believers
Slouched over the clear seeing eye
He marks down each death and he quivers
How he knows every wretch's death
And none of them are crystal believers",Metal

"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",R&B
"24 hours to live
24 hours to live
Seven thousand four hundred twenty-three grains
Of sand drop from the hourglass
It's how much time I got left on this planet
Some motherfucker's gotta die
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma, she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's '92, now the year of code blue
15 hours 11 minutes 30 seconds
I'm a motherfuckin' wreck
Gonna pay back niggas
who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long, I'm comin' strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggs, kill up 10 pigs
 and fuckas are
 altered  by a 2
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin' kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
Sky diving, scuba diving
To Evil Kinevil stunt car drivin'
Bungee cord jumpin' off a bridge
It's hard to breathe with a fractured rib
I can't take this shit
Let me see how much more time I got to spend
Hit more skins, back up in her pussy
Up in the back, I gotta let off a few more nuts
I'm starting to panic, I'm starting to sweat
'Cause I don't really wanna die yet
Dizzy spells, flashbacks in my head
Niggas ain't want me to bein' happy when I'm dead
But I ain't goin' out unless 30 niggas die
I'm dying anyway so I'm thinking suicide
Run into a crowd of niggas dyin' by the pistol
Took the motheruckin' whistle
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
To sweep with the feet when he hit the concrete
Chop him up, dice him up and sacrifice his meat
Drag him by his ankles to the cemetary

Shut the fuck up nigga, 'cause you ain't seen shit
I'm 'bout to take this and straight up grip
I'm holdin' the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now I'm mad insane, red as 
As I strain for my heartbeat
To thumpety-thump to pump, it might burst
False alarms and no harm that will commit to the E
But now I'm down to an hour 23
Time is moving fast, but not that slow
I thought I had an hour, but it's seconds left the go
I ran into the office
No more time is left
I ran up to the doctor with a bomb to my

24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
As time winds down to it's last 24 hours
In an earth that weighs 60 trillion tons
Traveling 1,037 1/3 mph, how do you define time?
What is a minute? How important is an hour
When 24 hours becomes a lifetime?
Ooh, so define how do we define time?
Now you choose
How will you spend your last 24 hours?
C'mon, talk to me
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die

Oh why, oh why?
Must die

"Dear sir I write this note to you to tell me of me plight,
And at the time of writing, I am not a pretty sight.
Me body is all black and blue, me face a deathly gray.
And I write this note to say, why Paddy's not at work today.
While working on the fourteenth floor some bricks I had to clear.
Now to throw them down from such a height, was not a good idea.
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he being an awkward sod.
He said I'd have to carry them down the ladders in me hod.
Now, clearing all these bricks by hand, it was so very slow.
So I hoisted up a barrel, and secured the rope below.
But in me haste to do the job, I was too blind to see;
That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me.
So when I untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead.
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead.
While I shot up like a rocket, to my dismay I found,
That halfway up, I met the bloody barrel coming down.
Well, the barrel broke my shoulders as to the ground it sped,
And when I reached the top, I banged the pulley with me head.
Well I clung on tight though numb and shock from this almighty blow,
And the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below.
Now, when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor,
I then outweighed the barrel, and so started down once more.
Still clinging tightly to the rope, I sped towards the ground.
And I landed on the broken bricks that were all scattered 'round.
While I lay their groaning on the ground I thought I passed the worst,
When the barrel hit the pulley wheel, and then the bottom burst.
Well a shower of bricks rained down on me - I hadn't got a hope.
As I lay there moaning on the ground: I let go of the bloody rope.
The barrel then being heavier it started down once more,
And landed right across me as I lay across the floor.
Well it broke three ribs, and my left arm, and I can only say;
That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today.",Folk
"I don't know why
why you had to leave me
and i don't know why
you said goodbye
only if i try
can i feel the earth beneath me
and as days go by
i come alive
the fall of your hair
the feel of your skin
and the smile on your face
as you took me in
now i lie
and stare at the sky
still i wonder why
i don't know why
you said that you'd release me
no matter how i try
i still feel you
i watched a falling leaf
drifting down towards me
carried by the wind
it disappeared
i sat in disbelief
at what had become of me
and as the day grew dark
i rose to go
and as i walked along
i thought i heard you call me
alas i was alone
so i went home
the fall of your hair
the feel of your skin
and the smile on your face
as you took me in
now i lie
no longer cry
but still i wonder why
i don't know why
you were taken from me
i cannot forget
or say goodbye",Indie

Who likes to ride the bikes exercise and go running

And a dope biznitch to share the fantasy with me
And live virtually responsibility free, I want it all g

"Here I am, through the gloom stare
Again in hunger, and thirst for something new
Tonight - my hunger I'll please...
Your presence makes my pulse increase...
There she is - all in shiny black
Gothic queen, come with me
Let's get closer - let's unite
Let me enter you, and become as one
I beg for thee please bend down
I want to see you from behind
You move your hips, side to side
Feel me - go down...
Latex queen - feel my tongue in deep
Whirls around - climax is almost found
I rise to my feet - erection slides in deep
I pound you hard - latex queen feels so sweet
Feels so sweet...
Latex queen - feels so sweet
We become as one...

""I love the way - your latex shine""

"Keep falling in and out of love
In search for what I'm dreaming of
I long to find a love I'm sure about
That certain kind of love that moves all doubts
Keep falling in and out of love
Still searching for that special one
To whom I can give my love completely
And feel a lasting love so sweetly
Just when I feel sure love's here to stay
It seems to suddenly just fade away
Can't seem to find that everlasting love
That this heart of mine needs so much of
Keep falling in and out of love
Can't seem to find the lasting kind
It seems I can't find the joy I need
Love always somehow all goes wrong for me
Keep falling in and out of love
Keep falling in and out of love
I keep reaching out for tenderness
Touching a hand that holds emptiness
Well I'm looking for a love that lingers on
Long after that first kiss is gone
That kind of love that keeps burning bright
Long after we've said goodnight",Pop
"I can still remember
Every song you played
Long ago when we were younger
And we'd rock the night away
How could I see your future then
Where you would not grow old
With such a fire in our bellies
Such a hunger in our souls.
I guess I probably loved you
When those words rolled off your tongue
It seemed that we were travelin'
Under some ol' lucky sun
I know I couldn't save you
And no one was to blame
But the road we shared together once
Will never be the same
Hey, hey gonna fly away
Won't be coming round today
Hey, hey with a song I pray
And on the wings of a song I'll fly away.
I wandered in the wilderness
For a while I was so lost
To everything there is a season
And every blessing has it's cost
So I took what you left me
And put it to some use
Went looking for an answer
With those three cords and the truth
I come down from the mountain
I come walkin' in your shoes
I was taken for a gambler
When I had no more to lose
'Cause you put me on that pathway
How could I refuse?
And I spend my whole life out here
Workin' on the blues
So I carried on.
You can't be haunted by the past.
People come and people go.
And nothing ever lasts.
But I still think about you
Wonder where you are
Can you see me from some place
Up there among the stars
But down here under heaven
There never was a chart
To guide our way across
This crooked highway of the heart
And if it's only all about
The journey in the end
On that road I'm glad I came to know
My old friend.
Hey
Gone away
Won't be coming round again
Hey
With a song I pray
And on the wings of a song
I'll fly away
I'll fly away
I'll fly away",Country

I'm here right here my beloved

Not a care in the world got to me
But now I lay me down to sleep
I'm afraid of what I might see
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by
Used to feel like a man in control
Unaware of the storm in my soul
The sight of you took away my breath
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by
Now in this dream I'm in a room
All dressed up just like a groom
Watchin' shadows dance in the ledge
Suddenly you then appear you whisper in my hear
And I jump right over the edge
Just a dream that I seem to recall
Can't you tell me which doctor to call
Tell him please I'm not feelin too well
Everynight I'm hearin' wedding bells
I wake up screamin' when your dream goes by",Country

Almost time to get my fix, I just can't wait to see her pretty face

I found someone who really deserves me

My shit was tight, you blew it baby, word is born
And after all I've done for you
You messed around and blew the best thing that ever happened to you, baby

Now don't go and put this all on me
Since I left town, you've been tryin' to run down
On every girl you see
I can't believe you do this to me, ooo, baby

I slowly slipped through the kitchen door I thought I was doing right fine

I found the note into the wall and this is what it said
You done lost your baby lost your baby lost your baby tonight
You done lost your baby honey baby you just ain't been treatin' your baby right
You come home every night about a quarter past four
And then you come a sneakin' through the kitchen door
You done lost your baby lost your baby lost your baby tonight

I said this just couldn't happened to me this must be a dream that I'm in

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeers and his sleigh. So

I found your merit in a furrow nearby
Mourn to save you, your own beholder

They're painted handsomely so you abide

Numb yourself and you will stay inside

A feeble rodent can only withstand so much
Knives point at me when you are guilty
You are guilty
Pay it forward until you are free
Nothing else is worth it, only me
Settle your wounds
Fill your cup with something new
Settle your wounds
Strip yourself from what you knew

once again runnin' away with me.

Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

There's nothin' so hard about the life that you've led
As far as I can see there's no reason for goodbye
You're just runnin' scared and that's something I won't buy
So you lose, I won't let you go, there's nothin' to show but more blues
And all this talk about leaving's strictly bad news
So you settle down and stay with the boy that loves you
Oh, you settle down and stay with the boy who loves you
Yeah, you settle down and stay with the boy who loves you...",Folk
"I've never wanted wealth untold my life has one design
A simple little band of gold to prove that you were mine
Don't want the world that have been hold for fame is not my line
Just want a little band of gold to prove that you were mine
Some sail away to Araby's another land of mistery
But all the wonders that they see will never tempt me
Their memories will soon grow cold but till the end of time
I'll have a little band of gold to prove that you are mine",Country

Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm starin' in the wind

The darker gets the less fairer it has been
The hate, the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finga

Like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs
Sometimes to believe me
Who freed me, Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps?
Or is it God's speed that we travel at
Endangered in our own habitat
Them guns and dope, man y'all can have it back
As a matter  fact, we them lab rats
You built the projects for, now you want ya hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it makes the pipes bust
From schools to prison y'all, they tryna pipe us
'Til you're political parties invite us
Instead of voting laws in spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fightas 
Fight in, our wars and your wars, you put a nigga in Star Wars
Maybe you need two, and then maybe then we'll believe you

Yeah, that's black America again

We go here, we go here, here we go again
Trayvon 'ill never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from cheap black smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
Made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slaves to the blocks cause on 'em we spray shots
Leavin' our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomach stay in a knots
We kill each other, more than the cops
I wish the hatin' would stop
We are at war, in a battle with us
I know that black lives matter, do they matter to us?
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass-incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony? or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova makin' more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need , , and Cory Bookers

I'm no angel, I got an angle
Back to the crib, bitch I'm tryna get you naked and bone
She's no angel, but with the blow she's a snow angel
The dangers of taking her home

See my fears and read my mind
If lawyers steal and doctors lie

Ask for the bill and then we'll split when she goes

Oh that night they wounded Old Ireland
And she's bleeding to this day.
The Border lies like an open wound
That only love can heal
For bitterness and cruelty
They will never close the weal
The mean of vision built a dream
Which the blind men stole away
Ah that night they wounded old Ireland
And she's bleeding to this day.
My heart it holds a vision clear
That thousands more can see
Of Ireland free from hatred
And death and bigotry
Where Irishman to Irishman
Can in friends clasp a hand
If we banish fright from the Ulster night
Then we'll free Old Ireland.",Folk
"Open to discussion
Were the moguls from the top
I didn't want a failure
And they didn't want a flop
So I drew the plans up carefully
With the strength in the design
And I signed it with my signature
To show that it was mine
But I waited all that morning
And I waited all the next
Preparing for an interview
By reading from the text
But they didn't get my letter
So they couldn't really tell
So I made this bomb for the GPO

"Well I've been lockin' myself up in my house for sometime now
Readin' and writin' and readin' and thinkin'
And searching for reasons and missing the seasons.
The Autumn, the Spring, the Summer, the snow.
The record will stop and the record will go.
Latches latched the windows down,
The dog coming in and the dog going out.
Up with caffeine and down with a shot.
Constantly worried about what I've got.
Distracting my work but I can't make a stop
And my confidence on and my confidence off.
And I sink to the bottom and rise to the top
And I think to myself that I do this a lot.
World outside just goes
It goes it goes it goes it goes it goes
And witness it all from the blinds of my window.
Three, four
I'm a little nervous 'bout what you'll think
When you see me in my swimming trunks
And last night in New York I got raging drunk
Remember one time I got raging drunk with you
Now, I can recall a time when we made the city
Streets our playground, kissing in the fountains
Filled with cigarettes and bottles
Sped through Italian city streets of cobblestone
Because we had to
Because I loved you
Because the damned alcohol
Because what ever at all
Now I've grown to aware of my mortality
To let go and forget about dying
Long enough to drop the hammer down
And let the indolence go wild and flying through
Because we had to
Because I loved you
Because we had to
Because we had to
Because we had to
Because we had to
Because we had to

If you seen how niggaz hit the club, they pullin' out Uzis
Sometimes bruisin' and grazin', mostly takin'
No more sleep for the shooter, no more of hangin'

Six in your truck, get you each a casket
Put termites in your box, let 'em eat your cabbage
A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic
Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active
If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes
But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic
Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail
Cops on the payroll, show me and Quinn live well
And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well

Spark up a dutch, Game, put niggaz in a coffin, too much
Turn niggaz kids into orphans, too much, in God we trust, nah

Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts

"There we go, there we go
I think we're live again
Yeah
Check it

All alone, unplug my phone
Back in the zone, been home but been gone
Prioritizing life in case I do not live long
And finally found some time to sit down and pen this song
Might as well try to tell you how I feel when I feel
And not just when it's time to pay some bills, life is real
You can miss it everyday, trying to get a little pay
Fill the page with some change
Try to feel a little change on my mind
I be thinking about the rain but
Sunshine shines everyday but hey
What can I say?
This is sunny California where the phoneys run up on you
Cause they want you to be just like them
I'm on the corner 'bout to get a swisher from the liquor store
Twist the dro, sit at home, pen a song
Call a chick, get some dome
Play my shit, when I roll
Cause nobody knows my mental like me
Open my window let you people get a peep, peep
My life is simple, yo they think the shit is deep. Sheep
Be sleeping on me cause I finally got some sheets. Please
That's for wifey not just hoes that want to ride me
Cause they like me when I'm riding the beat
""To each his own"", niggas say. They gripping chromes
Splitting domes in they song, when
I just feel I'm pennin' a poem
Peace

I can't believe they think it's 
Even my peeps say it's 

Just because I'd rather eat in peace
My life's been a bitch like this chick named

Sitting alone on my own dick is 
And when I'm gone, ""home sick"" is just 

Yeah
All alone
Back in the zone. No, wifey at home
Been home but ain't boned though
Threw a few dollars to her
Told her get her comb out my hair
Turn a square to a spliff and lift my dome in the air
Above clouds where the rain falls all inside my home
Like, pain colored paint balls
Call it what you want
Niggas laugh cause my faith strong
All I know is no one knows the places that I've gone
Or faces that I've seen cry, seen laugh, seen die
Seen eyes with my life in all of them
Seen signs of falling but I caught hope
Will in my wings, halo, I'll haul hope
To faith like a new black pope
Fuck a debate
I am dope when I want to be
And flow when I'm on the beat
I stroke when I want to; need to skeet
Fuck the streets
They will fuck you if you don't
""Keep your enemies and homies on the ropes
When they supposed to be close""
Poppa told me. And the few that know showed me the ropes
Hanging on dreams to be happy, whether lavish or lean
I've seen enough to make a boy die nappy
Now a man on a search for the God that I am
But actually I'd rather be me
Is that ?
My poppa told me it was 
My old lady said it's 

Because I'd rather be all by myself
Instead of laughing with the crowd
If I don't care to be part of their gaiety
They'll often say to me, ""Don't be so proud.""
But how are they to know?
I'm looking high and low
For love that used to be my own...",Hip-Hop
"So ya never meant to hurt nobody
Well I think your full of it
'Cause if ya really really didn't want to hurt nobody
You wouldn't slept with my best friend
And I bring insult to my injury
You weren't a bit discrete
And while the world stood witness
To my embarrassment
You put a knife inside of me

How could you fall in love with him
How could you give your heart to him
Thought we'd grow old
As lovers
Together til' the end
How could you fall
Fall in love with him
Now I know we've had our, up and downs
And that I do admit
But sometimes lovers go astray
But you've made it permanent
Oh I can't be there understanding
My heart's just not that big 
And I can take the pain
Of infidelity
But I can't take you with him

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

It's like we stuck in a prison
Suffering from lack of wisdom
Suffering from lack of substance
The systems lacking some ism
Since it's killing the misery
Hope my children remember me
Since I sing songs of symphony
Somethings just gotten into me
Message don't kill the messenger
Message travel through seven seas
Ghetto passion is classic, been getting lashes for centuries
Aided by mostly separated by color deficiency
Free to you free the shackles my mental strain from my ancestry

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

Emancipation, castration, mass-hating, white washing
Black shaving patience, that I'm demonstrating, ugh
Segregation, separation, take my people, chain my people, ship them out, build a nation, picket lines, demonstration
Kill switch, detonation, this takes dedication
Guess that NBA our reparation governmental medication
The reverse of levitation, they put fluoride in our water
Guess they trying to kill our babies
Hearts racing, cops and robbers car chasing

Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

Whatever your purpose is
Hone in and hold your kids
All of this is distractions and nobody notice it
Feeble for knowledge we still in chains
Power tripping for digits we growing it every day
Fighting for freakom ? service with student aid
Can't afford to be sitting order pills to get paid
Taught to follow the system that institution be prison
These coppers turn me to zombie
I'm walking dead while I'm living

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

They saw me in sadness and pain
My wounds will never heal
Every time I walk in my garden of flowers
Trying to feel alive again, but I fail
Nothing more than a dead leaf I have become
Why am I so far away from home
The pale faces of my ten feet high statues
Are crying tears of blood
Their wings are broken and lies scattered in the snow
No more I regret my deeds
The gods created me this way
To hear the thunder before it strikes
To dream about things that will happen
To be the one you so much hate
We hear the voices from the past
Their anger spread among us
Some may hear it some may not
We who hear them are guardians of the truth once lost
Our path not yet revealed
But I know these lands are not meant for my feets to walk

"I wish I was in Carrickfergus
Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
The deepest ocean for my love to find
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
Neither have I wings to fly
If I could find me a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over to my love and die
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times spent so long ago
My childhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on now like melting snow
But I'll spend my days in endless roaming
Soft is the grass, my bed is free
Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus
On that long road down to the sea",Folk

Raising towers in Babylon.

To attitudes of your brain.

A life in ruins.

Please cross my path and feel my wrath
Deserving victim, now feel the aftermath
Now meet your doom

Don't ask why
Why do I criticize?
You're all that I despise
Now see the rage in my eyes
I am your judge
this is your trial, no sense in denial
I am your judge
Your sentence is death
Inhale the lead on your very last breath
Your executioner, that is I
Say your prayers ... now you die
Don't ask why
Why do I criticize?
You're all that I despise
Now see the rage in my eyes
I wish you could live through me
And feel the way I feel
And daily confront your fears
Never shed a single tear
It's always been like this
The world fears my labour
None understands  I've done
them a favor
If I could - mass genocide
None spared - None left alive

Could this be the Christmas I was searching for?
My mates went away and they didn't invite me
My parents aren't dead, no they just don't like me
But two blocks of snow and a pumpkin together
I made a friend who'll be with me forever
Cause it's a Minecraft Christmas time
Chilling with my buddy even though i'm offline
There's a whole world of joy and cheer
That's a very very very nice Christmas you're having this year
We built a house, well it's more of a shack
I got the wood and he's got my back
He throws his balls at the mobs so unruly
I deck the halls with this Lapis Lazuli
We ventured out just my snowman and me
We found a sapling for a Christmas tree 
We skip back home so happy and gay
No wait, I meant that in the old fashioned way
We had a roast chicken cos the game's not got turkey
We made mashed potato from the squids there so derpy
But the furnace was hot and when I awoke I found
15 little snowballs lying there on the ground
Cause it's a Minecraft Christmas time
Nothing seems cheery now my buddy has died
And there's a whole world of pain and fear
It's a very very very bad Christmas I'm having this year
There goes my phone, it's a text from my dad
An early gift; he got my internet back
Hop on the server all my friends are online
Turns out they've been waiting for me all of this time
Spawn into the world and what do I see?
A snowman party for my homies and me
Exchanging gifts, dancing without a care
Me and my snowman we're walking in the air

And we'd drive until that jealous sun fell down
Just to wash ourselves in the moonlight summer sounds

Candles burn, 'cause the world will always turn
I'll burn both ends until my fire's out
Lost in the darkness, I can still scream out

Sheltering in the Trenches again,
Crying for a lose,

So I took my last waltz,
Got caught up in the wire,
Wrote a letter for my love,

Way to the coast, bathe my wounds in the sea,
I'm in the hands of a ghost, im in the hands of a ghost
Their boats came on in,
I tried to run away,
I got taken half by the throat,
In the burning light of day
Set down with the iron punch,
So broken and alone,
Left my blood on the beach for the tide to take me home
These wounds that I shed inside,
Two years old
So my girl she gave up,
She had taken me for dead,
She had forgot all her promises and everything she said,
Living in the darkest dream,
I rose up in the cold
These wounds that I have outside,
Are two years old,
These wounds that I have outside,
Are two years old,

Living by the mile I toke the same walk down,
As I did as a child,
The flags flew for a man,
Unaware of the fate no one saw me walk down, on my very last parade,
So thoughts turn to dust,
As I headed for the mound,
I strayed up the part, waiting for the count,
Living in the darkest dream so broken and all alone
These pain that I have inside is two years old
These scars that I have inside are more than two years old

"Regret for every step I took
From Fisher Road to Hollywood
Feelin' bad and actin' good
Never was content
It was hostel moves and hotel rooms
Watch my friends promote their dooms
From Pontiac to Newport News
Nothin' made much sense
And I had to leave a few behind
When they replaced the apple wine
With cocaine and codeine pills
I knew I was done
And I didn't really say goodbye
They'll walk their path and I'll walk mine
I will find other ways
To tear my body down
I am staying here with you
I've done all I know to do
They say ""stand up straight and take your eyes
Off the wooden floor""
No, I didn't find what I was looking for
Still I had to go
From Fisher Road to Hollywood
Still I had to go
From Fisher Road to Hollywood
They taught some bigger words to me
At the university
Only it's a curse to speak
Without some regard
For the one I'm talking to
Do I sound like a friend to you
Do we even speak the same
Language anymore
I am staying here with you
I've done all I know to do
They say ""stand up straight and take your eyes
Off the ballroom floor""

The gentle lap upon the shore
Behind the green fern
Undressing though I could not swim
My body pierced, I threw me in
Just like the clean worm into the lake of sin
A secret knock there on my door
The sun is hot poured on my floor
I push it back out
And now it's cool inside the box
And as I pray, another knocks, I am so devout

In the springtime's golden light
The flowers, they dance in the gentle breeze
And the warm sun shines so bright
And of all the flowers in the forest
And all trees that do abound
The ones that please my heart the most
Are green the whole year 'round
Green the whole year 'round,
Green the whole year 'round,
The holly yew and the ivy tree
Are green the whole year 'round
When summer comes and the days are hot
And the birds are full of song
In the quiet shade of that leafy glade
That is where my heart belongs
For I know whenever I look for you
That is where you can be found
As you take your ease 'neath your favorite trees
That are green the whole year 'round
Green the whole year 'round,
Green the whole year 'round,
The holly yew and the ivy tree
Are green the whole year 'round
But the summer fades and the days grow short
And the autumn winds they blow
And the leaves of gold come tumbling down
To the forest far below
Memories of other days come tumbling from the past
To remind us, like the seasons do
That life goes by so fast
The winter lays her fingers cold
On dark and lonely nights
But christmas it will soon be here
To usher in the light
And when morning breaks and the bells ring out
It is such a joyous sound
To hear them echo in the trees

A bluebird lived in a jaybird's eye
Buckeye Jim, you can't go
Go weave and spin, you can't go
Buckeye Jim
Way up yonder above the moon
A blue jay nest in a silver spoon
Buckeye Jim, you can't go
Go weave and spin, you can't go
Buckeye Jim
Way down yonder in a wooden trough
An old woman died of the whoopin' cough
Buckeye Jim, you can't go
Go weave and spin, you can't go

"This is me, black and most hated in all fifty
From Genocide to Swastikas and right wing committees
This is me, the witness to governmental conspiracy
Overcrowded cells breed addicts to feed my street
This is me, the one the Aryan nation wanna touch
Burn my church, set me up, hog tie, wet me up
And at the same time my own block, hold a nine
And a bullet with my name in case I go against the grain
America sleeps, while children play with cyber sex
And my neighbor's hard to love 'cause I know he child molests
Money manifest the greed, greed manifest the murder
Murder manifest revenge to hold the cycle of the sin
But I shot Lucifer, Christ compelled me
Christ compelled me, we bring the truth to life
I shocked the world with it, shocked the world with it
A governmental conspiracy to murder me
Descendants of Charles Manson never seem to cease
'cause everyday man impregnates the belly of the beast
This is me, in the United States of Amnesia
Your state of a union don't address me
When my block is in the seizure
This is me, the revolution televised in the century
Millennium Armageddon, every time you ever mention
This is me, I fight holy wars with the dot coms
Raise wars and modern Vietnams, they yellin'
This is me, I circle your retreat
I'm standing at the foot of marshall law
And I watch my homies bleed
America sleeps, and money got the kids impressed
Put the president in jail, he in office having sex
Politicans ain't real, motherfuck the police
In the cells on the inside, the jails and the streets
But I shot Lucifer, Christ compelled me
Christ compelled me, we bring the truth to life
I shocked the world with it, shocked the world with it
A governmental conspiracy to murder me
I shot Lucifer, Christ compelled me
Christ compelled me, we bring the truth to life
I shocked the world with it, shocked the world with it

I am the Alpha to the seventh power
Omega in its last hours

All get devoured
Expose the cowards
Chaos and power
The Devil is yours, the Lord is ours

"When first I came to Louisville
Some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington
Was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks
Her ruby lips
Like arrows pierced my breast
The name she bore was Flora
The Lily of the West
I came to my love Flora
Some pleasure there to find
She turned in to another man
Which sort of stressed my mind
She robbed me of my loyalty
Deprived me of my rest
I loved my faithless Flora
The Lily of the West
Now down in yonder shady grove
The man who was to come
Conversing with my Flora there
It seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him
It sort of me oppressed
I was betrayed by Flora
The Lily of the West
I stepped up to my rival
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar
And I boldly made him stand
We met in desperation
I pierced him in the breast
I killed the man for Flora

Ain't nothin' comin' close to this high
Doesn't get any better in this life
We got such a good thang
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're lovin' each other it feels so right
From the beginning it's like I could read your mind
I knew what you were thinkin'
When I looked into your eyes
You gave me that feelin'
That's keeping me warm inside
And I would be happy
To stay by your side
Cause we got something
That's just so hard to find
Come with me
All the signs say this was meant to be
Sometimes love is such a mystery
But it seems clear to me
We got such a good thang
Ain't nothin' comin' close to this high
Doesn't get any better in this life
We got such a good thang
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're lovin' each other it feels so right",Metal
"When I go don't cry for me
In my fathers arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay

Would blow your heart away

In time my love would stray

And who, who's gonna love you like I do

Written by Babyface
Performed by Klymaxx
Verse 1
Ive been searching for someone
Someone who could show me love
I never knew, what love could do
Until the day, the day I met you
And in my search I found a love
The kind of girls like me dream of
And now I thank my lucky stars each day
Ive been so blessed ever since you came my way
Chorus
And all I keep thinking about is you
You make my dreams come true
Long as the sky is blue
I just wanna make my life a part of you
All I keep thinking about is you
You make me feel brand new
I wanna share this love
Feel so wonderful
And I owe it all to you
Verse 2
When I was scared and all alone
My best friend called me on the phone
And said Dont be afraid, it wont be long
You just keep the faith and keep holding on
And then you came into my life
And suddenly my road seems so right
I never knew what love could do
And Im so glad I wished for you
Chorus
And all I keep thinking about is you
You make my dreams come true
Long as the sky is blue
I just wanna make my life a part of you
All I keep thinking about is you
You make me feel brand new
I wanna share this love
Feel so wonderful
And I owe it all to you
To you
To you
And all I keep thinking about is you
All I keep thinking about is you
You make my dreams come true
Long as the sky is blue

All I keep thinking about is you
You make me feel brand new

"
This some intimate thoughts In a porsche
Sipping cris' through a straw
You wanted war trying get through her sure
I was bored, tried to get me a broad
Not a bitch or a whore
I'm talking rank, trying to settle the score
Diamond to dog, living like the kind in the air
Peace to my earth, I swear that she the mom of the year
Peace on my turf, ducking all the monitors here
Beating the dirt, success is like kilometers near
Stuck at my worst, karma talking dead in my ears
I'm writing this verse, same time I met with my fears
Quarter-century but way way ahead of my years
I been gone since Daquan seen him dead at the stairs
Stay strapped though
Never lack though
Watch your back though
Word to Fat Joe, we let them ninety-nine clap more
This the city called the rotten apple
Now you know if you didn't know, nigga better pop a Snapple

Sitting in the room like
While the room is spinning like the bitch in exorcist head is
My mind is always on lettuce
Paper chase
Shrooms laced
Herd the road is infinite
No chain, no pendant
No Range, no Bentley
My rhymes be shittin on lives of rappers you into
It ain't ironic I use a number 2 pencil
Better pay homage if ever we you bump into
Shotty pump hit you, momma grab the tissue
Extra magazine make a nigga want a issue
Saint Laurant leather i'm like Fonz with a pistol 
In broad day I'll address any issue
And undress any damsel in distress if she into
Dead niggas, and I ain't talkin about the presidents
Or the evil residents
Never see the bench again, All 4 quarters
It's onslaught pure slaughter
All aboard bitch cause it's all water

The messiah and the maestro
Pen prolific and now i'm twisted off nice dro
Thoughts gifted i'm not existing tonight ho
I hit her once slide shawty like the iPhone
So I shine regal for the people and parana
One kiss for my girl, 2 kiss for my momma
Parted from my pain won't dissipate
This is missions on minimum wage
Until i'm dug up out the grave; reincarnate
Pour her ass on the glass off the bombay
I get around, 2Pac, just like the song say
Gold frame of thought fuck your loss this is Fonzay
The columbine of the comic-con
I'm blowing up for the common kind
I told you pigs I ain't fond of swine
I got my own shit, while you ride in mine huh?
And we causing ramadan and you not a soldier
Need a shoulder you can cry upon


Run from the ops, duck shots and maintain
Timbs butterscotch, Balmain at all aims
I ain't never flop my name hall of fame

"I tried again, I went last night
Another date was just not right
And as I drove myself back home
A little voice said ""just be alone""
But sometimes I think
I see you in a crowd
It's not picture perfect you're just meant for me somehow
And I'll miss you till I meet you
Oh I'll miss you till I meet you
I miss you all the time
I love the world just as it is
And I won't lose my faith in it
But there are days I think of you
Saying ""Hey that's beautiful yeah I see it too""
It all goes by so fast, like waving hands
Wanna capture things
Find someone who understands
And I'll miss you till I meet you
Oh I'll miss you till I meet you
I miss you all the time
Can you keep me awake
I thought you could help
Just to feel my way
Find my better self
Oh I'll miss you
Oh I'll miss you
I miss you all the time
The morning's gone
All dreamed away
But that's all right
It's Saturday

That they might see
The next chapter of their destiny
And on Monday morning comes around
Get the work done but I listen for the sound
And I'll miss you till I meet you",Indie
"
I'm sitting here watching my daughter being born
Feel like I should thank God that nothing went wrong
Back in my days I was headed straight for the graveyard
Running from school cause enemies never stay far
Wear my colors watching colors chasing after my older brothers
Cause they was always into shit, good thing we had different mothers
Playing football in the streets with the homies
And local drug dealers kicking back making money cause the crack fiend
Was always there so I start selling that cane cause nobody never cared
Mama at the post office working that late night shift
Taking care of my sisters cause my daddy wasn't shit
Sweating over the stove and on a school clothes
Open the refrigerator like where did the food go?
Trying to do whatever I can to be a man, hope you understand
Even when shit goes wrong it's part of God's plan, Amen

Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed

Laying here staring at this Doggystyle poster on my wall
Banging Snoop Dogg spinning this basketball, what the f-ck is going on?
In a n-gga head, all of my homies gone to jail, or they end up dead
Got my first tattoo tear when I was 19, chasing a pipe dreams
Chrenshaw boulevard chilling, that was the night scene
And like the movies, n-ggas act a fool
When you pushing a beemer, who gives a f-ck about a School?
Mom's seta curfew, but I was breaking all the rules
Kicked a n-gga out the house so I started forming my crew
Getting a little bigger on my own, in the 12 grade crips scheming on me
Cause they know my trap self made, trying to get by or getting high
That's how I survived, be a leader not a follower, that's how them cowards die
Pay 'em no mind but keep my chrome to the end of time
Feeling like no n-gga can see me I think they're going blind

Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed

Seemed like just yesterday a n-gga was only 21
Showing the little homies how to use a f-cking gun
Now look what I become, n-gga was on the run
from the coptom slums, they right, like father like son
but I'm missing them days when I couldn't roll up a blunt
Bust the windows out of cars just to only drive it once
Yeah them was the days but now a n-gga getting paid
Pouring down rose for my n-ggas in the grave
My n-gga Big Will and my homie P D
Feel like yesterday we was just running in the streets
And I swear to God funny how the time fly
And the only thing certain is that we all die
So let your soul fly

Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah

If you'll just give it one more try I swear I'll always be here when you need me
If you can find in your heart to forgive me I'll try to keep my feet on the ground
Forgive a man so busy going up in the world

I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk,
I believed I could do anything,
you made the world dance,
you made the music come to life

This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gon let you go,

Whose Michael Jackson?
You're Michael Jackson,
I'm Michael Jackson,
We all Michael Jackson,
I guess what I'm asking is, everybody bow their head for a legend,
don't breathe for a second,
now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about,
so you can hear my message, my confession, someone tell Usher,
I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him,
like he touched me, like he touched you,
so carry on his legacy, something i must do,
and I trust you lighting candles, concrete visuals,
me and my brothers listen to Jackson 5 in the living room,
first thing i did when i heard was call puff,
cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us,
who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead,
him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge.

This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and i wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gon let you go,
As I'm pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker,
when list my air ones, MJ was my nigger.
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star,
and since I'm a Hollywood star Imma tell you my story,
never had a family that close,
never see Berry Gordy walking through Interscope,
but just like me, they always had Mike in a scope,
no matter what you say,
imma love him and hes still dope,
let me take you back to '85 when i was in a zone,
dancing for my momma, 'Thriller' jacket with all the zippers on,
now im doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston,
listening to Outcast, I'm sorry Mrs Jackson
anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king
so we wont Corretta you,
I'm writing this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids,
time to let us through.

This the type of song that make the angels cry,
I look up in the sky and i wonder why?
why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,
you were chosen from the start
never gon let you go,

This the kind of song that make the angels cry,
look up in the sky and ask God, why o why why

"On the day that I was born they say I came out wearing these same clothes
and since then I've been trying to find out where I got these same clothes
I went to every store asked every tailor there could be
wondering if somebody had the same clothes as me
and it took a while but I learned there's nobody with these same clothes
And when I wake this morning I'll get up put on these same clothes
And I'll step into the sunlight and start walking in these same clothes
And when the air turns cold and the clouds bring the rain
These clothes they will protect me 'till the skies clear up again
And against the wind I'll button up the collar on these same clothes
And when we first met I'm sure that I was showing off these same clothes
And when I gave my heart to you I did so in these same clothes
And before we first made love you pealed off each one from my skin
'Till there was nothing left to keep you from coming in
And you saw who I am in the absence of these same clothes
When they get dirty I wash them with care oh these same clothes
And when they lose a button oh they tear in these same clothes
Now most days when I dwell on not what is but what is not
I look at other people and all the clothes they've got
Until I realize I could have nothing but these same clothes
And our children will know what it means to have a loving home
But there are things they will have to figure out on their own
And I promise I won't ever try to make them wear these same clothes
No No
Ohh Ooo ooh
Ohh Ooo ooh
Oooh Ohh Do do do
When I leave this world please separate me from these same clothes
Just burn them into ash no one can ever wear these same clothes
And if you knew me well you know how much I cherished you
Remember that I wore these clothes the only way I knew
And I was happy and I was blessed and how I loved to wear these same clothes
Yes I was happy and I was blessed and how I loved to wear these same clothes
Yeah I was happy and I was blessed and how I loved to wear these same clothes

Afraid of what the future would bring
Drowning dreams in polluted visions
As I heard the mourning angel sing
A bloody wing came in sight on the ground

The prophecy of a spiritual deed
Seems to increase in moments
Where the morbid mental activity comes into force
You will ride through the dark meadow

Weeping over the loss of a shadow

Oh the sweet fields of gold beneath the big blue sky
Let it be
Home is me
You are mine
Oh the purple mountain's majesty is calling
And the northern lights still dance above the snow
Yes Amazing Grace is still the fire beneath this life
Let it be
Home is me
You are mine
Let it be
Home is me
You are mine
Let it be

Tryin to hustle for the tin
A discipline tracks for my niggaz that rap
But now I'm back and I hope ya don't do that
Soul is the heart of it I hope I can get every lil bit of it
But sometimes ya gotta slow it down
Like the few Mc's that do shows in my town
Back in 2000 the rap game was lackin'
Like some of them rappers bringin' two steps back in
But today is the day for hunger in the game
It ain't bout the fame its all about the brains
And if you got that and yo rhymes are phat
Gone on head and do that
But ya always gotta think
Ohh you thought I stopped rappin
Put yo money back in the bank on my rank I'm numba 1
You is numba two I don't know what cha gone do
Ya gotta think it threw but too all my Mc's
Back in the game this shit it like it was back in the day

Check it out now
My boy doe just ripped it
Sip it smoke it do sumthin' wid it
Get suppa sick wid it
Girl I'm headin' to tha south
I really want you to head down south if you know what I mean
Use you're mouth like you're in a bath ridin' on a rath
But to all my niggaz in the pin and some waiting to get it in
I want all y'all niggas to

Super hyipihe in this bitch smokin' on da litch
Throw that bitch right back in that nasty ass ditch
X on my side slab on my phab my car shoot bullets
Like the arm of Donavaon Mccnabb but think fast hoe
Four-four gone blow me and E-40 we got all the dough
But my boy doe he git it to he hustlin' at fourteen
Tryin to get a wagur too

I spent hours in the back of a Dark Greyhound bus.
When I was a child
I heard ma father curse the witch
The neighborhood punchboard.
I squeezed my eyes shut really tight
Whenever I drove by the cemetery at night
But during the day I drank whiskey and smoked cigarettes
In the same cemetery that scared the shit out of me at night.

Afraid to go in the basement
Scared of what was hiding in the dark.
When I was a child I had a father
Who never knew me or saw me grow up.",Metal

As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

the further she'll get from you
Where's the light now you've only got the shade?
well she took all the colour now it's back to black and white days

And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home and tenderly behold

On bended knee their rosary is told

Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become, yeah
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, you're there for me
You cure my disappointments
And you heal my pain
You understood my biz and you protected me
I treasure every year in place a comemory
And that's why, I want my unborn son
To be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend

I still remember, I called you cryin'
'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, ""Beyonce, I told ya so""
Instead you said you'd get one too

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do, ohh
You've given me tight security
No matter what mistakes I know, you're there for me
You killed my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood by biz and you protected me
I treasure every extraordinary memory, that's why
My unborn son to be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky, know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming, Lord why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling, I love you so much daddy

I`m far to Dumb to try.

Why all the confusion
Why I`m not the same?
Am I just a little freak in a crazy messed up game?
Why am I such a failure?
Why can`t I clear my mind?
I just want to be free of this!
I want to learn to fly!

Burn up the chaparral,
Light it on fire!
Break the horizon line!
Scatter the travelers,
Birds on the wire.
When I survey the city
From my perch upon a hill, there are dark buildings
Shrouded in fog, shrouded in still.
I would lay it all to ruin,
I would alchemize it all to sand,
I would watch metropolis crumble
To prove that I'm your man.
End this jag
Of anger and loneliness,
Of failure at peace.

Don't limit collateral -
Ignite for release!

And the laborers will crawl out
Of the smoking windows,
And they won't know who to blame,
And they won't know who to blame,
And the slumlords will be
Crocodiles before the council.
When the coastline's turned to ashes
And the movie stars have run away,

And there we two shall stay.

"Deep in the heart
Love has many ways
Of touching your emotions
Taking control of you
And even in thought
Love can make you change
There's no way of taking control
When it's part of you
Well you could be a married man
With two kids and a good woman
And you could give your heart and soul
I swear it don't mean nothin'
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel

There's never a time
Cause love will let you know
Love appears at the worst and even the best of times
Takes over your mind
Your heart is not your own
There's no way of controlling love
It controls your life
Well you could be a faithful girl
With a good heart and good intentions
And you could never leave your home

"Tonight in Carolina, the bleachers are empty and quiet
Not a ball's been hit my way all night
I hit a grounder up the middle, but the shortstop made the play
I'll never make it to the big leagues this way
But the smell of fresh cut grass and peanut shells fill the southern sky
And we'll be heading back to Birmingham tonight
CHORUS;
These towns roll by like tumbleweeds
Through the windows of these late-night trains
To those of us down here, it's still a game
I may never be a hero, and you'll never know my name
But if I broke the record, I would do it clean
Last week out in Greenville, about an hour before the game
A boy was watching warm-ups, with a big smile on his face
He put down his popcorn, held out a ball and pen
He looked a little awestruck, as I signed it for him
I didn't ask for money, I just smiled and shook his hand
You should've seen the spring in his step, as he ran to show his dad
`
REPEAT CHORUS
America's favorite pastime, it's simple and it's pure
We all still watch the big leagues, but now we're not so sure
But if you can catch a game in Birmingham, on a perfect summer day
I'll run out every grounder, that's how I learned to play

Sometimes I sit at home
And wonder how it'd be
If he had loved me
Truly loved me, yes
I learned a while ago
The kind of thing
Never happens for me
And so I go around
And just pretend
Love is not for me

I play the circus clown around my friends
Make them laugh and they won't see
That you never let them see you sweat
Don't want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord knows it's killing me

So I put on my make-up
Put a smile on my face
And if anyone asks me
Everything is okay
I'm laughing 'cause no one
Knows the joke is on me
'Cause I'm dying inside

On my face
On my face

Sometimes I sit at home
By the phone
Hoping he might call me

But he don't call me

But then I realize
Dreams come true
Aren't for girls like me
Not like me

And so I go around with my head up
Like it ain't no thing
And when the boys around with all my friends
I'm into other things
Because you never let them see you sweat
Don't want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord knows it's killing me

And so I put on 
Put it on, put it on

Sometimes it's hard to

It's not the life that I would choose

Let myself

Go

Locked in this Grid like a Tupac tale
While her-on rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this Illa-thought
With afro-centric stamps I'm mailing thoughts
To my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, with Hieroglyphics spelled in chalk
I guess the hustling is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle
I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel
 Bust it

I just want to rock you
All night long
All 
All night long, all night long,
All night long, on and on and on and on 
I just want to rock you 
All night long 
All 
I  just want to rock you 
All night long 

On and on and on and on

A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses
Opportunity and the beat knocks
Women, give me rhythm like beat box, but it's the year
Of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'
Who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike
Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got sight
Like a destruction worker, when it's time to build
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's ""Time to Kill""
In perseverance I'm a find a meal, and provoke
My Gramps used to trick off big papers at the Riverboat
It go

All, night, all night
All, night, you got it goin' all night
All, night, y'know, y'know it all night
All, night 

I just want to rock you 
All night long, 
I just want to rock you 
All night long 
On and on and on and on

Check it
I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein street
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguing over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggas in my box throwing suggestions
Had me checking myself and double checking, I popped the ""Resurrection""
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writing niggas with stripes, I hold posture with
Popping shit to fat broads, wearing ostrich
Giving 'em voice mail, tracks are like County
To them I voice-jail, if you believe in Heaven
Why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell?

I just want to rock you
All night long, 
I just want to rock you 
 All night long 

I  jus' want to rock you 
All night long 
On and on and on and on 

I just want to rock you

She waits in the gutter
Someone she'll never find
Just a sill and a scheme
It's a suicide machine
She cried about the world
She slit her throat to fight it
Someone had told her she'd had it
Just a sill and a scheme

Never wanna walk through the park holding your hand

It no longer remains and now its heartache and pain because*
She never really knew she wondered
Was she being untrue or was I being a fool because
I'm gone and I'm never coming home
So baby don't call cause I won't answer the phone
Stay out of my life baby just leave me alone

I never wanna kiss you again
Never wanna walk through the park holding your hand
No more talking all night until the early morning
It's such a shame to say that we'll never be the same...again

You lied to me, lied to me
Girl you told me you'd be there for me
Promised that you'd never leave
You lied to me
Now I'm closing the door
Put my heart on the floor
I don't love you no more

And cry behind the door

To all tomorrow's parties
And what will she do with Thursday's rags

Para saber si aun vivo, nadie se da cuenta
Que el cielo se ha caido

Es tiempo ya de irme

No es el major momento

Hold onto, something bright as

Common sense is in your town
Verse one:
I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in
That be scatterin
Over the globe will my vocals be travellin
Unravellin my abdomen it's slime that's babblin
Grammatics that are masculine
I grab them in, verbally badgerin broads
I wish that madelline, was back on video lp
Raps I make up like blacks do excuses
I feel like noah, hookin my mellows up on deuces
If a broad ain't got a mind or job or crib she useless
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
They say signs of the end is near
I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin a beer
Got more verses than a kramer, go off like a pager
Skills uglier than craig mack in your ear I'm the flavor
My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise
Don't watch the bulls as much, they got too many white boys
A million black men walkin, towards one direction
For sure, the cream of the planets... resurrection
Verse two:
A prophet, raised among black disciples and vice lords
Who don't give a fuck about mic cords and nice swords
Get up, together black risk your cup
I'm wishin for a change, my man want his change in a cup
Yessir, I'm in the mix-a-lot
Bitches put em on the glass while I'm puttin stickers on they ass
I rule everything around me like cash
On the rocks of reality, dreams get smashed
In jams I m*a*s*h like alan alda

Eighty-seven strip walker taught the code of the area
By staying, within the barrier
Exposed to stony stimuli, with that I identify
Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness
Skull-caps, murf puffy jacket, lug boots on
Steppin to me is like goin to the county being a neutron

I ride the rhythm like a schwinn bike
When in dim light
I use insight to enlight
Device up in da skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe
Imaginations in flight
I send light, like ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights
And in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like
I spend nights up in dykes
I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I got it made
I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums
Hooked on negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggaz
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruisin southside streets with no heat and no sticker
U ak got my back and we don't get no thicker
Eighty-seven got my back and we don't get no thicker

Silently flew away
Away from sun, moon and big dismay
Away from earth and all the stupid people
Away from thoughts and evil
Away from fruitless tries
Away from all the feeble lies
Round and round repeating in your head
Haunting memories nauseating your heart
Remembering the creeping pain of loss
Putting on a false smile
Trying to be happy man you're not
Remembering the creeping pain of loss
Silently flew away
with the memory of a reckoning day
All life you have run from failure
Looked in every corner for a friendly saviour

"On a cold dark winter night
Hidden by the stormy light
A battle rages for the right
For what will become
In the valley of the damned
A warrior with sword in hand
Travels fast across the land
For freedom he rise
And the sign from the master on high
He screams a loud and across hear the cry
For the kingdom of fire and ice
And the power to be alive
Four strong ride on carry on through the war
Four strong carry on living for ever more
On the wings of death
By the hands of doom
By the darkest light
From the darkest moon
Crossing silent seas
Over mountains high
All will stand as one tonight
On the black wind forever
We ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom my guide
When the master will call us
He stands high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light
In the valley of the damned
Days breaks with golden strand
Over pastures green it glows
To where night returns
On the shadows faces appear
Warriors wearing full metal gear
Join together one and all
Before the glorious light
Rise up gather around come and hear what is said
Use your senses open your mind don't you ever forget
On the wings of life
By the hands of hope
By the brightest light
From the brightest sun
Crossing silent seas
Over mountains high
To the valley of the damned

Left blooming alone.
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone.
No flowerer of her kindred
No rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes
Or give sigh for sigh.

To pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping
Go sleep thou with them;
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.

When friendships decay
And from loves' shining circle
The gems drop away!
When true hearts lie withered
And fond ones are flown

Moving through the deep
You chase dreams across your sleep
Scarecrows, waiting at your door
In the last days of the century
Leaning from your balcony
You said this is how its meant to be
Can't you feel it in the air
See that light come shining down
All the way to Chinatown
See it come from miles around
Reflecting everywhere
You wore black clothes
You quoted Shakespeare
You still make me shake
When you get this near
You look like a still from Cecil B. DeMille
When I saw you waiting at my door
In the last days of the century
Leaning from y our balcony
You say changes come so rapidly
You can feel them in the air
Whoever you pretend to be
You must face yourself eventually
In the last days of the century
Who knows who we were",Rock

After the things that you put me through
You stole my money, my cigarettes
I haven't see hide nor hair of you yet
I want to know, won't you tell me
I'd really love to stay
Take me to the river, and wash me down
She cleans my soul
Put my feet on the ground
I don't know why you treated me so bad
After the things we could have had
Love is emotion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen will never regret
Oh want to know, won't you tell me
I'll be in love to stay
Take me to the river
Hold me, love me
Please me, tease me
Till I can, till I can
I don't know why I love you like I do

Your sixteen candles are right on my wall
They tell me who made a fool of them all

"Autumn leaves are falling 'round us
Time to gather all those many thoughts
Of all the things that might have been
Or gained at such a cost
For some of us there's endless hoping
For some of us craziness too
Holding on to better reasons
Works for me and you, you know it's true
And when the stakes are higher
Never play with fire, leave it alone
I wandered through a country churchyard
And wandered what kind of life they led
Walked into a castle ruin
Of gentry that had fled
For some of them had endless hoping
Some of them crazy too
Holding on to better reasons
We'll never truly know, oh
Those trees will tumble down on a stormy day
And those leaves will fade away, fade away

With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi""
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?""
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun
And if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say

And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'cause she's made that way
And if that ain't lovin' me

Constantly reminding me how much you used to care
And losing you is one thing I guess I'll always regret

A crater in the place where your home used to stand
Your arms twisted reaching up to the sky
Asking for the answer why

They lined you up along with the rest that survived
You dropped to your knees and you started to pray
Never stopping when they dragged you away

My Mother was the blood of my enemies, and the Fire of the sun, my Father.
An invisible chain forged in thorns, embrace and unite my crimson memory,
to the crypts of Insanity and delirium, where I can't find the Reality....
Dark Motions, Black eyes, and and mournful Lust, The wings of solitude.
I'm cursed to follow the Dead, to see how they vanish to their Destiny...
To feel and envy their final trip, 'coz I'm not allowed to see the final gate.",Metal

If I cannot hold you in the day

Your love for me decays

Though coldly forsaken, it's you adore
And if you'd return then I'd make you my bride
Or I'd cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side
On the morning we parted, how sad the farewell
Our words, they were few, but our thoughts none could tell
And when lost to my vision far over the brine
I drank your success in a goblet of wine
Three times have I crossed to the ship as she lay
Becalmed on the breast of the silvery bay
And my crew are the bravest ever handled an oar
And not by the tempest, they laugh at its roar
No ballroom can tempt me nor raise my dispair
For there none in the dance that with you can compare
And to watch the young lovers as they swing 'round the floor
Brings tears to these eyes that may see you no more
And in beauty there's none with this lady could buy
She's as pure as the stars and the blue of the sky
She's as fair as a lily and as sweet as a rose
And there's nothing can tempt me, her name to disclose

They gave her an epidural so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out

"I can't hardly wait
Tonight the need for love, is here between us
And the desire for each other, we cannot hide
Cause anxiously we wait, to feel the passion
That the hunger in our eyes, can't disguise
So girl let's not waste, another moment
Trying to decide, right or wrong
Just come and hold me close, to your body
And let's release the love we've been holding back so long
I'm trying so hard to be patient,
But when you're near me I loose control
And there is no time for hesitation,
And if you don't give your love to me,
I'm going to explode from
Anticipation, anticipating your every move
Anticipation, anticipating what we're going to do
Don't make me wait, yeah
So girl let's put an end, to all this waiting
And let the power of our desires, tonight unfold
No matter how hard, we try to fight it
When the needle rises baby, it's time to let go

Sharing the life of the mad and insane

I'm staying awake while the city sleeps
Watching the low life, the pimps and the creeps

I'd pick a lotta cotton work my fingers to the bone

If you would be my baby neath the old India moon

Catch you if I can

Something that I know
Moving on is, easiest when I am around you.
So bottle up old love,
And throw it out to sea,
Watch it away as you cry

Tied to, a dream of being with you

Walk along the razor's edge

how to keep it
Hit the wheel and double mistakes
throttle wide open like a bat out of hell
and you crash the gates

Going for the back of beyond
Nothing gonna stop you
there's nothing that strong .
So close now you're nearly at the brink
so, push it

Welcome to the limit

Take it maybe one step more
The power game's still playing so
you better win it
Push it to the limit

With no one left to stand in your way
you might get careless, but you'll never be safe

I'm a depraved, deranged flea-bitten hound
-Chorus 2X-
Ain't hydrophobic
No need to run
I'm just a mad dog
Having fun
-Chorus-
Looking for a bitch in heat
Begging for a doggy treat
You know my bark is worse than my bite
You'll hear me howling in the heat of the night
-Chorus-2X
Feel my bite
Oww!!!
-Chorus-
Oww!!!",Metal
"On a Sunday afternoon 
Really couldn't get away too soon 
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd like to be instead of
Groovin'
Down a crowded avenue 
Doin' anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we could see
We could be anyone we want to be
And all those happy people we could meet just
Groovin' 
On a Sunday afternoon 
Really, baby, I couldn't get away too soon 
We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it comin' closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly
Groovin' 
On a Sunday afternoon 
Oh, really, I couldn't get away too soon, baby

'Cause darling, you sent me
Groovin'",R&B

"The woman in blue, she's asking for revenge
The man in white -- that's you -- says he has no friends
The river is swollen up with rusty cans
And the trees are burning in your promised land
And there are no letters in the mailbox
And there are no grapes upon the vine
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore
And there are no diamonds in the mine
Well, you tell me that your lover has a broken limb
You say you're kind of restless now and it's on account of him
Well, I saw the man in question, it was just the other night
He was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight
And there are no letters in the mailbox
And there are no grapes upon the vine
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore
And there are no diamonds in the mine

Ah, there is no comfort in the covens of the witch
Some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch
And the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride
He trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child
And there are no letters in the mailbox
Oh no, there are no, no grapes upon your vine
And there are, there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore
And there are no diamonds in your mine

"Ha ha nothin but the best from the best
You feel me? hear me
This is dedicated to that special someone
You know who you are and you never gave me a chance
I used to watch you walk to class fine as can be
While I'm standing here with K.K. and D
And I did a liitle bit of everything just to get your attention
But I knew you had no eyes for me
I used to get up sharpen my pencil for nothin
You watch me watch you rollin your eyes and you still was bumpin
So when test time came I was all in yours
With no bubbles on my papers just some low ass scores
I guess you can call it puppy love I was a scrub
Having fantasies of me and you up in my tub
Makin love in the soapy water,having my daughter
But I knew you liked them baller dudes and, I did'nt have a quarter
I admit on the rainy days it was sad
Cause it was'nt about who you was but what you had
Now I'm doing swell baby and you know it's true
Back when you had a chance you should've let me breath on you
Sittin in my room thinkin bout you
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin
I'm Sittin in my room thinkin bout you
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin
Now I called you on the telephone baby it's david
The last you gave a chance is the first to save it
And I'm just tryin to hook us up for another session
Because I have'nt learned my lesson
Plus I got positions never ending
Now I'm descending down into your valley baby work your tendons
Doing what I do to make you do what you did
To make me come so hard that we almost had a kid
Platinum that's how I descibe your thigh
Tell me how come your so young doin shit that fly
You must have came from the school of hard knocks
Lickin on hard rocks and blowin off tube socks
Now whenever it's time for fun
You got me blowin up your pager with 911's ha
Now show me a little affection
But hurry up before I lose my erection
Because I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin
I said I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin

And now I'm sittin in my spa thinkin bout you
And you baby doll don't even have a clue
I'm just sittin in my spa thinkin thinkin bout you

"I've tried to drive away her memory but each night it comes back to torture me
Cause once again there she is right on time
When she goes walking through my mind
She goes walking through my mind caring out a little bit each time
Her footsteps're gettin' louder all the time when she goes walking through my mind

I've tried to drown my thoughts in the wine
But a glass full of heartaches is all I find
Cause once again there she is right on time and she goes walking through my mind
She goes walking through my mind...
Tonight I will sleep though I'm not trying
For sleep makes me dream then I start crying
Once again I'll get the glimpse of what was mine
When she goes walking through my mind",Country
"There's no fool like a young fool with wild and careless ways
Who forgets about tomorrow and lives just for today
If she could only realize the sorrow that's in store
She'd try behaving on for sights and honky tonk no more
It breaks my heart to see her drinking there with tavern lights a shining in her hair
She won't seem sweet sixteen tomorrow as today
There's no fool like a young fool who throws her life away
Now the dim lights and the drinking seems like fun I know
But she'll find out one morning that you reap just what you sowed
The sad part is she'll be alone once she starts to fall
There's no fool like a young fool who thinks she knows it all
It breaks my heart...",Country

Well little lazy rappers, obviously we never figured this would be the lick and we'd be next to shine.
And we got everybody screamin' and singin' but these out-of-shape suckas need exercise!
So I'm-a get up in their mental.
I'm-a work 'em out over the instrumental!
Give 'em a criminal rhythm, the lyrical nympho!
Wanna see the wicked?
Better know what you're in for!
First, the fan side could be forgiven ' you didn't know!
Second time, I got up in 'em like ""here we go!""

And everybody want a little bit against a little Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh!
A little taste so they can test and make 'em see how we the best
And I'll be realer than the rest don't flex 'cause the pump gonna get 'em.
I'm like a bullet to the chest, suffer a cardiac arrest that's so hard

Come 'on, now let me take you back to The Land, you know where the heart of it all.
In 1993, when we was up out the scene.
The fellas with hell of a harmony with the flow hooked up with Eazy-E and shook up the industry and y'all just in time to get another phase.
This certainly is somethin' that you wouldn't wanna miss!
The drama when it hit the fan, we got 'em trippin' off the gift, and split a wig up with a pretty sick twist.
The Ruger like a surgeon and it's on, exactly what I cut you with is sharper than a scalpel. Actually, it's too many Bone Thug clones and they all malpractice, arrested, and send 'em to the gallows!
My trues brought a style that's unfound and you can feel it naturally.
But we ain't no magicians.
Really ain't no thing to make a fraud disappear.
Steady givin' what they love to hear, make 'em listen up close.
Everybody know we got the dough.
We choppin' nothin' but missiles, still the nigga who the greatest!
Y'all lost!
Can't even afford the cost, this is authentic and nothin' that's dealin' with them world-wide bosses!
We got the sauce, baby, we got the juice!
We keep 'em in a frenzy fiendin' for more!
On the ThugLine with F.B.G., 7th Sign, and Mo' Thug once again we about to blow!
We about to blow! Set it off, explode!

I'm-a treat it like a race and I gotta win it!
Ahead of you bums with the Bone flow, thug invented.
Haters wanna wonder why them thug niggas still gettin' in.
Nothin' changed the game like we did so we here, still with it.
Gotta tell the truth.
We changed things.
Bringin' somethin' new that's everlasting.
I'm-a keep it real.
It's next to nothin'!
Doin' the same thing 'cause less creating.
Flow just borin', the spit just corny.
What happened to old bitin' 'self?
Writin' battles done face to face.
I miss those days.
These days, ghost writers, fake artists with nothin' to say.
I'm-a give it Wish due my street dues.
Just stay cool.
I know I got you when I need to pop you'll let loose.
And you don't wanna see a thugsta hit with a Grey Goose.
Or we could buy the bar, just stay cool and we good.
Recognize we thug, could of been all hood.
The flow's all love, thugs could of been all hood.
Pick up on it, never fully get it - this Bone flow!
Smilin', hatin' but you'll see me on the low! 
In the game with the number one!
Straight from the Cleveland slums.
Straight off the block, never hustle to the floor though.
Kickin' 'em down how them Bone Thugs came through.
Yeah, yeah.
We took it to another level , level , level

As soon as I'm receivin' the call, now give me the ball, I run with the dogs, then keep the b'all. Now meet me at the mall, you can check on every shelf on the wall, they makin' money off the Bone Thugs!
Equipped with a saw, with a knife in my back.
Everybody rappin' fast, but the harmony ain't in it, and now that's too much to pass.
Now that's too much to ask when you pick up a crash course style to change-up, come on!  My trigger-finger's itchy, but my carpel tunnel was gone it was written and rippin' problems like water flowin' in humbles.
I'm workin' with seven shovels, the grave-diggers and others!
Nobody understand The Man.
Clones, now shut-up!
I'm quicker than a boogey-wicked-monster, never just like the movie.
We know when we pray to God.
Keep goin' we get the hustle on in the Spring, Fall!
In Summers and the Winter months, we gonna praise Jesus!
Don't even represent us, like we ain't said nothin'!
Present the flow then grown know where we come from.
Sun come shine in, Equinox rhymin', Layzie  perfect timin', grab my gun!

I didn't think you'd really go
So here comes the sad spell
As my heart expands from the gallows
But this pain I was feeling
Was far from real
I thought you were teasing
I let go of what seemed
I'll spread it out
Wildflower
Wildflower
You picked me apart
Forget me not
My petals fell
But never begin to rot
So now you all know what was I
This flower I speak of was no buttercup
But this joy I'm now feeling
Is much more real
I begin again as a seedling
Running fire to the field
I'll spread my joy

Wildflowers, flowers
Wildflowers, flowers
Through the pain we merge so much more power
So thank you wildflower",Indie

Seen no tailights there for miles
And nothin? much but static on the radio

Towards the far end of the night
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
Heard my own beloved cry
I heard my one beloved moan
What?s the use in all the ache we must endure
I had no good reason why
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
Not a rail to grasp ahold
Nor a savior there beside

And I know my love by his suit of blue
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?

But a troubled mind, sure, can get no rest.""
And still she cried, ""Bonny boys are few,
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?""
There is a dance house in Maradyke
Where my true love goes every night
And takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you know, now, that vexes me.
I know my love is an arrant rover
And he'll go roaming the wide world over
In foreign parts he may chance to stray
Where all the girls are so bright and gay,
If my love knew I could wash and wring
If my love knew I could weave and spin
I'd make a dress all of the finest kind
But the want of money leaves me behind.

I entertain the notion
That he did live this while
But he's dead to this world
Carved out just like my heart
Soaked up and washed so lovingly
Cherished son unconditionally

In our sacred love undone

?I fear we must fall back, that gray is runnin' like a tiger?

I crossed the line and all the signs were kind of warning. I saw the future like a mother fucking omen.
It's my decision to go with my suspicions.
Black magic woman I believe in superstition.
The way you treat me.
You might as well be tricking.
I'm leaving and I'll never come back.
No.
Now I'm stuck here with all your little lies and it's your fault i don't recongnize.
The back of my hand, the back of my hand I thought I knew you like the back of my hand.
You acted so cruel, you know I can't stand.
The things that you do cause you know that you can.
The limo pulled up. I saw your new man.
Bet he wouldn't hold up to the back of my hand.
The back of my hand. The back of my hand. I thought i knew you like the back of my hand girl.
All the lovin', the bed we made; they're all lies.
Girl I hung in forever hey; yeah i tried.
All the fun and the letters babe: They're all lies.
Now it's done and forget it babe; now I'm wise.
Now I'm stuck here with all your little lies and it's your fault i don't recongnize.
The back of my hand, the back of my hand I thought I knew you like the back of my hand.
You acted so cruel, you know I can't stand. The things that you do cause you know that you can

"Oh I'd work for you, I'd slave for you,
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you! 
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along.
I'd gladly move the earth for you, 
To prove my love and it's worth to you;
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along.
With all the words, dear, at my command,
I just can't make you understand;
I'll always love you darling, come what may,
My heart is yours, what more can I say? 

I'd sigh for you, yeah, cry for you,
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you!
If that isn't love, well skip it, it'll have to do,
Until the real thing comes along.",R&B
"
Her dying embrace still haunts within
through the blackest shade of nightfall
her enchanting voice it whispers serenades
a dark romance. . . yet never again
fate so tragic is mine to keep
forever will I miss her last dying kiss
As the sun sets before my very eyes
so lifeless she sleeps never to rise
an erotic dream of a winters kiss
so warm it melts like the snow in my hand
An ebony tear sheds only for you
beyond this sorrow deep within me
a promise we made evermore
I loved you and still I do
""The light of our dying sun
faded so long ago
captured by this immense nightfall
my sweet goddess. . .
so pale so cold
naked she lay to the virgin snow""
Her dying embrace still haunts within
through the blackest shade of nightfall
her enchanting voice it whispers serenades
a dark romance. . . yet never again
fate so tragic is mine to keep
forever will I miss her last dying kiss
The time we shared your virgin kiss
and that of mine you took from me
I surrender my everything to you
then you gave your self to me
Under a sunless sky
beyond the midnight hours
to dance in the shadows while the sun sleeps
I held you with affection in my weak arms
I wish I never let you go
As I walk the path of this lonely journey
dreamlike it rains sadness so endlessly
awaiting the dusk to descend
remembrance and my tears for you
shall fall eternal. . .",Metal
"The healing nails sting my bleeding heart
Takes my breath away
Tear myself apart
The little girl in my bed has a gun to my head
Looks into my eyes
And says she want me dead!
You know that sleep comes with drugs,
and I'll drink my fears away
I'm not a boyscout
I'm a lunatic
Lunatic,
The bitch is dead!
Lunatic,
The bitch is dead!
The fat lady sings tonight
That voice disgust me
I'm not a boyscout
I'm a lunatic",Metal
"For you it's very easy
For you to spread the blame
For you it's very easy
It's done in another's name
Holy water burns like acid
Incense subdues the sheep
You're as clean as the Virgin Mary
From your mouth the poison seeps
I used to think it was funny
But it's very sad
That so many can be fooled
By a poor man in drag
All you seek are confessions
Like you were a god
Giving rosary beads to the Irish
Giving tambourines to the Welsh
You're crippled by guilt
Like a blamed dog
She can't control her own body
She must give it to God
I used to think it was funny
But it's very sad
That so many can be fooled
By a poor man in drag",Folk
"What kind of move is the best thing
For leaving you in the I don't know
You can leave the best of a cool nest
But there's no master plan when you go
You hear the swearing and the laughter
Smoke coming in from the neighbors next door
My Christina had the toughest set of lungs
She could out sing anyone
She'd have them up on the small floor dancing
Anyone knew anyone
I hate to be leaving in the middle of this
What can I say but
This city is chorded there's rhythm in the traffic
Spokes in the wheels wherever you go
I'm just one exception to be sitting here
Trying to carve out some kind of a home
Everyone around here lets their cats loose
To control the mice
It's the kind of neighborhood with a few broken down houses
But it's kinda nice
Going through photos of places you've been
The places you part
It's the packing and the moving that really holds on
To the rungs of a lonely heart
Just when you think it's over
Something new begins
Somewhere in the grander scheme of scheming
Just when you think you're stepping out
That's when you're stepping in
It leaves you open windowed and ever dreaming",Folk
"Black flags with your fingers as their sign in the subways
They show me the right path into your home,
in the city's depth
Down here are the villages of hope for the artists
Their caves, wich the trains never can reach,
so I go by foot
Rainbows in the sewer rising just like me
I'll live in the hollows near you to plant our subway tree
Stumbling in your foot step traces only I alone
have the might to reaad your black flags, to know where to go
Targets 'round your brests and 'round your belly button
Tatooed like myself at the same points.
It's the same motif
You shoot me your views under my skin through my circles
Radio, I received things that I missed, Is this higher love?
Suck me through the sewer, in my heart your key
I'll live in the hollows near you to plant our subway tree
Stumbling in your foot step traces, only I alone
have the might to read your black flags, to know where to go
Give me your higher love
and receive my higher love!
Gypsies cross my way, they say: ""Join our Cave Bells Cult
then we will save your body's health""
No my direction is soul
My cure is when I come to my deepest love
Suck me through the sewer, in my heart your key
I will be the only brightness for you and our tree
Stumbling in your foot step traces, only I alone
have the might to read your black flags,
to know where to go",Metal
"I want to touch you but I don't possess the power
It turns me inside out to feel the pain of your distress
You push the needle deeper in your arm for every hour
I know you're life was beautiful but now it's turned into a mess
I've tried to understand you but the thought seems so unreal
That a person would forsake herself and try to break herself with pain
Just like a child you're so innocent and you long so much to feel
But instead you push the needle deeper down your vein
Sad so see you sad to see your sorrow
You know I've seen you in so many different ways
The reflections of your agony are scarred upon your face
You warm the spoon just to numb yourself from much much better days
And you hope that someone else is there who might want to take your place
Every time you scream I hear you though you scream so silent
And you're longing for your baby child to be in a much better place
So addicted to your loneliness full of self destructive violence
You still try to love your child and see the smile upon its face

Take away the pain and take away the sorrow
I cry in silence hoping you'll come through
Take away the pain you could be dead tomorrow
I wish that I could help you but there's nothing I can do
I WISH THAT I COULD HELP YOU BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
I feel as if I'm by your side even though you're far away from here
The poison mingles with your blood and slowly satisfies you
But what I wonder most of all is if you really want to disappear
You keep struggling with emotions mixed inside you
Please don't disappear you know too many people love you
But you see you're still the only one that can ever dry your tears
So don't rely on anyone below or up above you
You better grab your life and then get a grip before it disappears

That's what she told me
So she snuck me in her cell phone put it up in her coochie

"Last night when I went to bed
With tangled hair upon my head
In every way I really was a kid
It happened without warning
When I woke up in the morning
I can't tell you just what happened but it did
I grew six inches in one day
It's painful when it goes that way
And now my skinny body's really achin'
And my skin just exploded
With an inch of oil it's loaded
It's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon
My voice is changing
Out of thin air
And body parts that once were smooth
Are growing bits of hair
My voice is changing
What does it mean?
I guess I'll be a real man
Before I turn 13
I buy two pairs of jeans a week
I'm such a tall and awkward geek
I fall down when I try to play a grounder
At dinner every night I eat
A giant heaping plate of meat
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders
And weird emotions come alive
My hormones are in overdrive
I've turned into a girl-watching creature
And all my friends their marks are shot
But they don't care because they're hot
For Mrs. Smith the mathematics teacher
My voice is changing
I hate to hear it crack
I pray to God I won't inherit
Dad's hairy back
My voice is changing
When will it end?
And when will mom stop kissing me
In front of all my friends?
Pretty soon I bet I'll
Be right into heavy metal
But my parents say at least it isn't rap
I'll start wearing stupid clothes
And threaten that I'll pierce my nose
And tell my parents all they like is crap
The first girl that I ever kiss
Will be the one and who could miss
Our love forever written in the stars?
But I don't think our love will last
Unless the four years go by fast
Till I can use the backseat of the car
My voice is changing
Out of thin air
And body parts that once were smooth
Are growing bits of hair
My voice is changing
What does it mean?
I guess I'll be a real man
Before I turn 13

"Bring down the rain bring out the ghosts
It's twenty-five degrees out on the West Coast
Every thing's in bloom there and I don't care
I've been thinking about leaving too
You pack as little as you can 'cause that's what you do
You put everything in storage and give the dog to mom
She wouldn't mind there's a big back field
A long time ago they stopped turning yield
You should see the view there from up on the hill
I fell in love with the train last week and everyone there
I got the scent of everyone's laughter in my hair
We watched the landscapes click by hell I was the engineer
I saw the country from the dome car and I was outta here
By night we traveled slow, by day we went fast
And no one checked to see where we were on the map
You knew you hit the prairies and you knew why
You take a deep breath and hold it in
And every deep breath seems to quiet the din
You forget about the time zones, there are none out there
Home for the reckless home for the race
It's home for a moment of time and space
You lose all your sleep when the playing is done
You learn the rails and you're learning on the tracks
Someone tells a story of an old steam back
And a village comes together seven coaches long",Folk

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea

My eyes had a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command

But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers

A grass-stained tear around its neck

and leave this street in my dust
But I just keep running on
I cant be sure where to lay my sorry head
Looking up at the same old sky, stuck beneath the blue horizon
Lo la lo la lay
If I die the way our friendship did
No regret and no goodbye
A breath of air left in a line I write
No photograph or fight
But I just keep running on
I cant be sure where to lay my sorry head
Looking up at the same old sky, stuck beneath the blue horizon
Lo la lo la lay
If love were to die without apology
Take these tears you claim are lies
Wipe out the wishing stars wipe out the warming sun
Leave the moon to grieve the sky
So if I die before my mother does
Then let me fly beyond the blue
And paint the moon the color of her eyes
And give my shoes away",Country

che ne dici di un romantico a Milano?
fra i Manzoni preferisco quello vero:Piero
Leggi
c'Ã¨ un maniaco sul 'Corriere della Sera'
la sua mano per la zingara di Brera
Ã¨ nera
Fuggi
cosa fuggi non c'Ã¨ modo di scappare
ho la febbre ma ti porto fuori a bere
non Ã¨ niente stai tranquilla Ã¨ solo il cuore
porta ticinese piove ma c'Ã¨ il sole
quando il dandy muore fuore nasce un fiore
le ragazze fan la file per vedere
la sua tomba con su scritte le parole
""io vi amo
vi amo ma vi odio perÃ²
vi amo tutti
Ã¨ bello Ã¨ brutto io non lo so
io vi amo
vi amo ma vi odio perÃ²
vi amo tutti

che ne pensa di un romantico alla Scala?
quando canta le canzoni della mala scola
quasi centomila Montenegro e Bloody Mary
mocassini gialli e sentimenti chiaro-scuri
Cara
scriverÃ  sulle tovaglie dei Navigli
quanta gioia, quanti giorni, quanti sbagli
quanto freddo nei polmoni
che dolore
non Ã¨ niente non Ã¨ niente
lascia stare
se la Madonnina muore nasce un fiore
lui non vuole che la sua ragazza legga
quelle frasi incise quelle frasi amare
la sua tomba con su scritte le parole
""io vi amo
vi amo ma vi odio perÃ²
vi amo tutti
Ã¨ bello Ã¨ brutto io non lo so
io vi amo
vi amo ma vi odio perÃ²

vi amo tutti

"My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley
Like a long ago sunday when I walked through the alley
On a cold winter's morning to a church house
Just to shovel some snow.
I heard sirens on the train track howl naked gettin' nuder,
An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter
Just from walking with his back turned
To the train that was coming so slow.
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder,
Throw your hands in the air, say ""what does it matter?""
But it don't do no good to get angry,
So help me I know
For a heart strained in anger grows weak and grows bitter.
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own
Chain of sorrow.
I been brought down to zero, pulled out and put back there.
I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with black hair
And my head shouted down to my heart
""You better look out below!""
Hey, it ain't such a long drop don't stammer don't stutter
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter
And you carry those bruises to remind you wherever you go.
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder,
Throw your hands in the air, say ""what does it matter?""
But it don't do no good to get angry,
So help me I know
For a heart strained in anger grows weak and grows bitter.

Tarnishes with the year's tears
The golden golden copper sun
Old eldest dead
Over the blue milky seasky
Loss and lost and losing

All the birds wing and fall
Through the heavens
The cloudy clouds
Of snow of dew and of smoke
A shuddering reflection
Vanishing with the dropped stone

Under the molten starrain
The flashing falling planets

So far I shall fall

His shapes bends
And makes s smiling bow
He careers and spiral down
Falls

To fall is human
To hope is human

As the rain falls

"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

"Paranoia is the insect working its way
Through my subconscious thoughts
It's the larve of self doubt
Gestating in my heart as I spiral down
And everything I touch is breaking
And it falls to earth in splinters
And I shiver as every splinter
Finds its way underneath my skin
And after 22 years I can still make my skin crawl
Every shortcoming, a pitfall
On my way to making amends
Within myself to be what I became
Sometimes it feels like the whole wide world
Has made itself my enemy
But I will stand upon my own two feet
And raise my head up
I lick my wounds
Trying to cleanse the infection
Rabid and diseased reality fades away
When I pushed myself too far
A dream of emotional perfection
Has left a wounded heart
Trying to perceive the gifts inherent inside me
It's like squeezing the trigger
It's like opening first
On everyone who's let me down
On every beautiful lie that is only fiction
For the first time
I'm losing control and I like it
Freedom feels like the noose is gone",Rock

Changing my life with one wave of his hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

I want him everywhere
And if he's beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere
I want him everywhere
And if he's beside me I know I need never care
Oh but to love him is to meet him everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

And destroy the prettiest starry night. every evening that I die.

I am exhumed just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold.

I am exhumed just a little less human
So much more bitter and cold

I will kiss every scar, and weep you are not alone
Then I'll show you that place in my chest where my heart still tries to beat.

Whether serious or rehearsin'

Dope MC employer on ruthless and that's my label

You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gonna diss me if ya don't even know me
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound

To let ya know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall be dunn

Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the a-g-e
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed

Vow to destroy to the utmost
Thus my armies of upper Egypt shall sail upon the great Nile
For all the years of oppression and cruelty their souls soon shall fly
Fly, To heavens skies
Fly, Spirits rise
With my legions before me like a fiery flame in the nigh
A Hyksos vessel commands a force and confront us by the break of light
Upon them like a hawk I close in, Lions feasting on their prey
We continue to destroy on throughout until mid day
Take slaves for our use, years of abuse
War goes on for weeks
Their armies are becoming bleak
There is no where to turn
Their ships we shall burn

An arrow through my heart

Part Ahmose successes me

In early fall when the brown leaves fall then I'll catch a glimpse of you
Should you go first and I remain to finish with the scroll
No lenghtening shadows shall creep in to make this life seem droll

And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy
Should you go first and I remain there's one thing I'd have you do
Walk slowly down that long path for soon I'll follow you
I want you to know each step I take so that you may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road you'll hear me call your name

Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me

Facing the darkness

Deep in his castle he said
All land'll be mine

The triumph of shadow is near
Deep in his castle they sang

Until all will be thyne
All land is mine

Wash away all fear

No song no tale

And the victims of defeat

And look out for your kin

And with my ears you'll hear
You troubled my day
And you've questioned my strength

Controlled, broken, and lost
Without resource to sustain

Now everybody blames his old man for makin' him mean as a snake

Tie a rope around his waist throw him in the swamp

About forty five minutes southeast of Tippidoe Louisiana
Live a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
Well they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groc'ries
Named him after the man of the cloth called him Amos Moses
Now folks around south Louisiana said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest the meanest alligator and just use only one hand
That's all he got left cause the alligator bit him
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow
Well the sheriff got wind that Amos was in the swamp trappin' alligator skins
So he snook in the swamp gonna get the boy but he never come out again",Rock

"Memory of these blood stained faces,
In the darkest corners of primeval wisdom
She lays awaiting the masters of faith
Mistreated actions take form, in an outlet to avenge this rage
Drowning within the spiral of this hellish plane
A naked body layered with sigils of this summoning
These preaching altars transformed for consecration
Like blood and fire
In the sacred chalice of Satan
I hail the blood stained horns
The goat of a thousand young
Clandestine episode of inflicting torture,
On the self to culminate the powers of evil
An urge to take lives in these sadistic ways
Reflection of horrific gaze
Frozen with blurred visions
Trembled lips beg in whispers
To represent the force of this offering
Convert the virgin essence,
In offers of rape to the black goat
Sanctified gestures of the perverse
Attained in the source of anointing the God of fire
My name is spoken
Echoing through the void
Disciples of the damned
March into the fires
Treacherous disciples
That brand the names of hell across virgin skin
Forcing a trauma that induces this demonic hallucination
Bleeding soul of the virgin whore
Swallowed in the storms of flesh
A rising dawn of cruelty
Awaken the impure
Perception of the deviant, to the judges of mankind
Slashing her wrists and arms, in hell their hearts lie
This proof of devotion
It had death's face
Anticipate the cry of a hundred prayers for the release of pain
This eve of lucid conjuring
Defiled notion of praise
Fatten the beast with her flesh
Her screams are unheard, except for the dead
Adorn this whore of God with horns
Screaming fury of eternal escape
Conceptual journey to seek the birth of evil
Arouse her fury in various states of amputation

What can you see
Beyond without doubt - What to
Believe
What to believe
When all reality lost its mind
What to conceive
Dealing with the people when the
Problems
Don't fade away
And you find yourself dreaming
For...
Dreaming for another day
Inside looking out
Can you believe what you see
The unpleasant sight
For a place with so much greed
Infectious destiny
I find it hard to make my stand
I see no way out

"Hey, Skee, tell 'em I'm goin' away for a while
 Motherfukka's wanna see me dead
 Motherfukka's wanna see me in the fed's
 Bitches wanna give me head
 Dollars in my bank account
 Soundscan the first week out
 Motherfukka's on my dick
 Motherfukka's talking shyt
Hit a break down...
I'm the king, and you better respect it
All I need is Beyonce, and a Roc-a-fella necklace
Nigga you can ""check up on it"", I'm a Slim Thug
Cincinnati fitted, wit the red and black brim blood
Gave nigga's 300 bars, two mixtapes, and a DVD
I did it for the C.P.T.
Did it for New York, did it for Chi-town
Ran through hip-hop, and made these nigga's lie down
I'm going away for awhile, call it a California vacation
I call it a Bentley with a smile
GOD bless the child, wit incredible style
Nigga sicker than West Nile, who king of the West now
I'm putting my vest down, nigga's ain't going to kill shit
Shut the fuck up, nigga you ain't going to kill shit
Rappers don't kill rappers, guns kill rappers
And I be wit real crips, real bloods, real clappers
Fuck rappin, these nigga's will push ya grill backwards
Faster than Iraqis when Bush attacking
My flow semi-automatic, blhow
Touching pussies is my job, you a bitch, this is sexual harrassment
Nigga get a lawyer, when 'The Game' coming for ya
My jab, like Zab on the chin of De La Hoya
I'm the golden boy, and I'm making Hova noise
Got the whole world clapping, just like the Nolia Boys
Since a juvenile, I had to prove my style
Went from Kayslay to DJ Clue, and blhow
20 Magazine covers, nigga look at me now
You need a hot 16?.. I need 100 thou
Cause half of these rap nigga's just be running they mouth
The other half, in the ATL runnin' the south
10 Mill in the bank, 7 bedroom house
I'm rich, so on my 30th birthday I'm out
Nigga, I'm so ahead of time, and I spit better lines
Better rhymes everytime, nigga's hate on me so much, I feel like I'm Kevin Federline
Fuck it im rich, for nothing, tell the media to get off of my dick
You wit me, my next album going to sell like Britney
I beat on these rap nigga's like Bobby do Whitney
No more drama, no more beef wit 50
And if you just tuning in, welcome to the 360 
Right back where I started, in Compton, taking out the garbage
Where Crips and Bloods shoot it out like Pearl Harbor
That was '95, when Cube was in his prime
You brought yo Lethal Injection, and I brought mine
Rewind to '89, got my first mixtape
My brother brought it for me, they use to call him Big Face
But now, we ain't brothers, nigga we ain't shit
And you living in my shadow like Marcus Vick
And I heard about yo little rappers talking shit
Stay out my family bidness, or you get a coffin quick
I ain't change, same nigga that got off them bricks
Got signed to Dr.Dre cause his bars is sick
Getting head on the road, cause his cars is sick
And he whop so good, I had to pause this shit
I told 'em bomp, slow down baby
Got to get this shit firm like Foxy, NaS and AZ
She said 'fuck you,pay me
So I left her in AZ
That's what I get for letting her listen to my Jay-Z
Fuck a bitch, give me a 40, I'll take that
Dress up for the grammy's, but I still don't drive maybach's
Nigga I'm gangster, and homey don't play dat
Stand way back, or get ya ass clapped ASAP
Nigga this the payback, you want beef.. say that
I'll have a hundred hurricane hoodies where you lay at
Get yo whole clique wet, making up crip sets
Nigga got ran outta New York by Dipset
Then he got ran out of Compton by my set
Banned from Watts, can't even walk through his projects
Nigga so lame, talking he gangbang
Won't bust a shot, and the nigga know where I hang
I'm Big Daddy Kane, and the platinum chain
The fact remains, the game don't rap for fame
Game rap for fun, Game blast his gun
the game gotta rap in tongue, so that bastards done
Be easy, I might give you a pass this once
I'm ready to die, but I don't want a bastard son
Nigga, I rap too good, and I'm back in the hood
On the same couch, I put my demo in a package for Sug
After one meeting, I was right back in the hood
Red bandana hanging, selling crack in the hood
Now it's, Aftermath for good...
Any nigga mention Dre, get a Desert Eagle shoved in his fucking face
How that taste?
Blow yo shit out fa'real,
Call Nelly or Paul Wall, tell 'em make you a grill
I cook beef, like a steak on a grill
Got the clipse on hold, but I ain't Pharrell
Nigga I'm fa'real.. my flow ill, like smoke in ya lungs
I Spit sharp like a razorblade under my tongue
Nigga, I'm number one, motherfukka bar none
Who else kick knowlegde outside of Hova and the God Son
We can go bar for bar, cocksucker drop some
Watch me Take Flight like Tom Cruise in Top Gun
You might win some, but you just lost one
I beat on these lil nigga's like Dr. Dre drums
Look at these motherfukka's trying to prove theyselves
Thinking beefing wit hurricane going to boost they sales
Never that, motherfukka, I'm a clever cat
Kanye West in slacks, nigga, I'm as fresh as that
Ask Dre, ask Snoop, I'm nice
I'm Cube, I'm Jacob, I put rappers on ""Ice""
A skee , let me ask you a question
If you take the 120 bars, put it with the 240 bars
Then add the 360 bars, wit one Kevin Federline, what you get?
 Haha.. lets get the fuck outta here man..
Go find something to do",Hip-Hop
"What a beautiful thought I am thinking concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word
Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teaching but really they find no mistakes

I am glad I have learned of her meekness and I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Saviour's true look
When he comes descending from heaven on the cloud as he writes in his words
I'll be joyfully carried to meet him on the wings of that great speckled bird",Country
"Octagon sided summersun blinded my eyes
Though overwhelming curiosity itched in me
Exhausted arms trembled and touched a tree
Familiar senses hungering for more
A dry silence fell to pass by a feary whisper
This little maid seemed as helpless and lost as I
Then shimmering words asked for a favour
Lay down with me tall stranger
Simple words unable to reach my tounge
Songless birds never be the same without
Ruby hearted from then and ever after
Wet grass met my naked and frozen skin
Their purple clouds was like ours used to be
And the distant lovely laughter helps me remember
It hurts me to say I'll never see them again",Metal
"Stand not in our way, stand not in our way, Beelzebub;

Get behind us, behold the Yahweh,
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way,

I?m tryin'to resist all this temptation that I?ve been facing lately
Constantly praying that I can make it and keep on shakin' Satan
It?s drivin' me crazy 'cause he makin' the plate look oh so tasty
Then again, I?m knowin' that it?s only Yahweh that can save me
Livin'in this world today It's really gettin harder to stay awakened
But I'm not tryin' to get caught too drowsy 'cause I know we're waitin
Just contemplatin' on my situation, hopin' that my desperation eventually breaks my concentration
But I'm waitin' cause I'm aware that it's a snake in the grass
Can't wait for God to free us"" we can scream it at last
Now oh my God, God, God! God of my God, God, God  Steady all day
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way, Beelzebub;
Get behind us, behold the Yahweh,
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way,

Stand not in our way, stand not in our way, Beelzebub;
Get behind us, behold the Yahweh,
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way,
Beelzebub; get behind us behold the yahweh
As long as the Lord got my back, I won't be afraid of the evils around me when they surround me
I drop to my knees and I pray to the Lord proudly
Probably, these trials and tribulations in front of my face is a test so I be standin' firm in my faith
Stand not in my way, stand not in my way 'cause I'm a soldier ready for Armageddon, prepared for my day
Make no mistake-stake-stake stake; These bells above, they never break-break-break
You hear the alarm; We're headed for ruin
This world is so wicked; Controlled by the superpowers, the Federal Government
They' wagin' these wars for this oil, actin' like they love it
We rise above it 'cause they can't deny the truth
And the truth is to the youth; Better strap on your boots
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way, Beelzebub;
Get behind us, behold the Yahweh,
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way,
Beelzebub; get behind us behold the yahweh
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way, Beelzebub;
Get behind us, behold the Yahweh,
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way,
Beelzebub; get behind us behold the yahweh
Everyday's a replay; We always facin' evil people
Some have them wicked ways, some donate they lives just to make us not equal
And oh, my Lord I want to make it welcome in your home, but I must demand forgiveness 'cause I done did so wrong
I gotta make a stand in my way, whatever I gotta do, I'll do it; Lord, just show me the way
So I pray, yes for me, and all my peeps in here that don't believe
It's hard to seein' what we see, but you got to
Just let it begin and you will feel that faith inside you
Never alone, always right beside you

"It's early in the morning, way before dawn
I down a cup of coffee put my lucky hat on
Get down to the water, before all the crowds
Gonna have more fun than the law allows
With my hot rod, I go out to prove
When I'm on the prowl, I never lose
I fire up my Merc and put the throttle down

I open up my tackle box, it's so big!

 And scrape out its guts

I fish on the lake, by the sunken tree stump
Between the sewage output, and the chemical dump
Don't swim in the lake, says a sign on a tree
It's a good thing that fish can't read
I got my 10 dollar lure, the one that floats
And I make a big cast from my 20 grand boat
With my thousand dollar rod, or maybe it's more
Gonna catch me a fish that's 5 bucks at the store
 Gonna have some fun
 'Cause it's number one
 Gonna sit on my butt
 And scrape out its guts

But hat's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
'Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever whatever
You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'ma tell her, daddy's your umbrella
Give her the glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gon' be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?
Hey y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma
You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, her left the car seat, but I'ma tell her later
Forget the car seat, man, I'm hella-faded
She like ""I know you ain't high!""
Shit, ""I'm celebrating""
Now we in the car, she won't put on her seat belt
Screaming at the top of her lungs,""God, I need help!""
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine she pulling on me ""Stop I'm about to crash, shit!""
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
Them butterflies still here, am I happy? Hell yeah
I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think, think damn one of the nurses stuck their head out
They gave her an epidural so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
""Breathe, one, two, three, four, one more, two, three, four
""Push, c'mon T, push! God damn it, just push!""

Jennifer im really sorry for all the headaches caused by me,
and I realize you are always there, why I cannot see.
But I've got to let you know it's not in vain.
Confusions the best to describe the time shared by you and I.
Were on and off and on and off again, the cycle just wont end.
And your always ready to start again.
Chorus:
Each day I love you more than the day before,
And in my heart you'll stay my Jennifer.
Verse 2:
How can you and I be so in love, and still fight every night.
I think im still trying to find myself its hard to settle down.
And I know your ready to say I do.

"Yo no siento nada
Pero presiento que a chorros se escapa
La magia de mi alma gastada
Ella en la calle tirada
Algunas sirenas lejanas
Que suenan en la noche olvidada
Veloz caballo de acero
Tu gasolina, mi sangre y su cuerpo
Se mezclaron en el suelo
El gris de la carretera
Dibujando su melena
Y la luz se le apagÃ³

Se le apago la luz temblÃ³

Luche buscando una salida
Para ir a escuchar su corazÃ³n
Con las manos confundidas
No me mantengo en pie, no llegÃ³
Hasta la niÃ±a de mi vida
No porque no habla no entiendo
HarÃ© un momento me iba diciendo
No corras tanto que tengo miedo
La ambulancia volaba
Entre la vida y la muerte pensaba
Que echaba tanto de menos su casa
Amarga risa en la cama
Imagina que es una diana
Con todas esas agujas clavadas
Bromea sobre su suerte
Le harÃ© sentirse mÃ¡s fuerte
Entre la vida y la muerte
Se piensa tan diferente
Y la luz se le apagÃ³
Y su voz se le apagÃ³
Se le apago la luz temblÃ³
Le cerraron las cortinas

"The winds of chill December sound
The farewell of the year
And evening shadows gather Ã¢EËround
And cloud the soul with fear
But rest you well good Christian men
Nor be of heart forlorn
DecemberÃ¢Es darkness brings again
The light of Christmas morn
Ã¢EËTwas when the world was waxing old
And night on Bethlehem lay
The shepherds saw the heavÃ¢Ens unfold
A light beyond the day
Such glory neÃ¢Eer had visited
A world with sin outworn
But yet more glorious light is shed
On happy Christmas morn
The welcome snow each Christmastide
Falls shining from the skies
On village paths and uplands wide
All holy white, it lies
It crowns with pearl, the oaks and pines
And glitters on the thorn
But purer still the light that shines
On gladsome Christmas morn
The shepherds poor, how blest were they
The angel song to hear
In manger cradle, as he lay
To greet the Saviour dear
The Lord of heavÃ¢EnÃ¢Es eternal height
For us a babe was born
And He, the very light of light
Shone forth that Christmas morn
The chapel lights above the snow
Do warm the coldest chill
And manger scene, by candle glow
Inclines us to goodwill
Ablaze in wonder and in awe
As every heart adores
But brighter still, the light that falls
On gladsome Christmas morn
And oÃ¢Eer the child a guiding star
Shall lead us into peace
And still in souls, that childlike are
His guardian love shall be
Oh then rejoice, good Christian men
Nor be of heart forlorn
For unto you, in Bethlehem
The Son of God is born
DecemberÃ¢Es darkness brings again
The light of Christmas morn.",Folk

Give a nigga head and they don't know how to act

Call ya baby daddy, he ain't no where to be found

"If my years were less if my shoes were new I'd pack my things and I'd leave you
Hitch myself to some westbound train you'd never see me again
If I could dream as I once could I'd be gone it'd good
I don't want to live have never try in some old house where love has died
We once had love but it's gone now don't know when don't know how
We're two strangers under one roof no need to lie that's the truth
Love has gone there's nothing left I wanna leave can't help myself
Don't want to live have never try in some old house where love has died
Too many ghosts walk the floor ghosts of the love that ain't no more
I'd like to have what we once had ain't no way that's too bad
Cause you're too much a part of me for me to be ever free
So we'll keep living and neither tryin' in some old house where love has died",Country
"I walked with you and talked with you
And held your loving hand
We loved awhile and I lived awhile
And I thought that fate had it planned
Then someone stole my angel
And I lost what I loved most
I may never get to Heaven
But I once came mighty close
I may never play a golden harp
Or spread celestial wings
Or walk a golden staircase

But once I held your sweet love
And felt your tender touch
I may never get to Heaven
But I didn't miss it much",Rock

 Yo, there they go!
Ooh, I'm gonna do the whore!

""What you lookin' at?""
I replied, ""Nigga, you could get took for that!

we stepped to her butch calmly
cause no nigga can harm me
I'll whoop his ass in the grass

he got a soft spot
I'ma beat him down until he cough up blood
thugs surround
but they can't tell my men
with the locks got a Glock supportin' me
he tried to rush me
but I bust him in his grill
caught him slippin'
and I said, ""You oughta chill""
then his friend tried to jump in
I had to find a piece of lead to rub his rump in
suddenly the vice came
but them niggaz down the street in a dice game

Breaks me down into a sorry sad thing,
Not some iridescent grateful butterfly

Not the power of a mystic silence

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

All those grand historic paintings
Morning light on polished swords and burnished pride
Ancient smiles encased in whalebone
Spines of steel from head to tailbone
Cannons poised to blast the turning of the tide
It's a sad and a strange thing
But it's time and I am changing
Into something good or bad, well that's your guess

"On this site of reflection, you came to me as a ghost
Near this monument of the fallen, where one hears the sad last post
Celebration in the city of Ypres, again a new year was born
Not on this place of eternal silence, where quietly souls mourn
For time did not matter on this site, of the graveless dead
Near the leafless trees, we somehow met
On this site of reflection, you came to me as a ghost
Near this monument of the fallen, where one hears the sad last post
Born in different times, we never knew each other,
Born in different times, we never even met
But on this night when the world celebrates, believe met:
But on this night when the world celebrates, I regret your dead
On this site of reflection, you came to me as a ghost
Near this monument of the fallen, where one hears the sad last post
Thousands of names engraved, poor souls fate did not spare
The night was cold, the wind unkind, still wondering what brought me there
Born in different times, we never even met
But on this night when the world celebrates believe me: I regret your dead
Tragic appearance, your uniform torn, your skin full of dirt
We did not speak, nor laugh or cry, did not utter a single word
We kept an honourable distance, borders of time cannot be crossed
As ther is between the living, who hold on to live at any cost
And the dead, whose lifes and dreams along with their bodies lost
Here you appear, probably a trick of the mind that I might have lost",Metal

Queen will be quite pleased

The more that they wanna take

I got news breaker it's just a small technique quality
They what they blame it on
What you banging ban out thirty homes
I'm a grown man, and my past is a blur
And can't hurt playing axe if I was talking about her
The bad thing is she really wasn't sure
If she was a whore or a queen and I'm really not sure
If I'm a nigger or a king, you staying stand up
If you know what that means
It mean stand up if you know what I mean
Oh man, I talk to holy ghost
Now it's more like my soul's on comatose
And I wonder lead them through the light
I lead them through .. and boards turn to gun like turning half pikes

And report that you wanted more, you steal cause it's hard
We hope for depresses like Smeagul live in
We love Jay's life but we don't need baby seals story
I'd rather be annoying when I'm shooting the last
No triangles over my head but folks live rock to rock, block to block
I want them to do better so I try to find something else to rap about
Lord, it's hard, cause that's all that they see
I know they hate themselves and I know they hate me

To the little old church by the road
I could see the dear people and hear them so plain
Singing songs of that blessed dear Lord
I could hear my dear mother as she formidably prayed
Blessed Jesus help me carry my load
She was never downhearted never dismayed
In that little old church by the road

There my mother would pray
And my sister was saved
Singing sinners come and repent of your sins
There the angels were crowded and the sisters would shout out
And the bread was saved amen
It was there I met Jesus and gave him my life
It was there he took the weight off my load
And he freely removed all my sorrow and strife
In that little old church by the road
I remember the preacher so gentle and brave
As he told how the father above
Gave his only son Jesus all the lost ones to save
Such wonderful wonderful love
I will always remember when the preacher would say
Come to Jesus he'll lighten your load
So often he preached of the life giving bread
In that little old church by the road

I could never forget all those lovely old songs
That the people so joyfully sang
How they told the Lord's message to sinners gone wrong
And the echoes so joyfully rang
I would always remember how I truly believed
Jesus took all the weight off my load
And the joy of salvation I truly received
In that little old church by the road

"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured, as it was, by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence that was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them
They only saw shadows you see, without the truth to the eyes
The happy folk were blind
Falling out of airplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead
In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
It's rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the strange folk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain
Holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the monkey would stir from it's deep sleep
Then there came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany so immense
That it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then
Nothing
Oh little town in USA, the time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me out?",Rock

And when I am down I know that I can always come to you in prayer
Just to know I can always count on you

My head fell, I grew tired I just had to close my eyes
I didn't know how I stayed on the road but somehow I made it through
The only thing that I could do is lift my hands to you.

And know that you'll be there
Feels good to hear you say
You watch me everywhere
And when I am down I know that I can always come to you in prayer

The world is like a time-bomb
And it's about to explode...
There once was a young boy...a modestly done boy
Who seemed pretty normal on sight
Wantin' for nothin'...but wantin' for somethin'
But mama made everything right
Inside her protection he learned of rejection
By a world that was not quite his own
He took his reward in a double-edged sword
Now the poor boy is always alone
He built himself a time-bomb
A ticking, talking time-bomb
It's about to explode under me
His world is like a time-bomb
A walking, talking time-bomb

A young girl waits by the phone
Longin' for daddy...she's missin' him badly
She knows that he's not comin' home
So down by the levee...her heart weighin' heavy
She knows that she's got to break free
She falls when she sees him...she knows how to please him
They can't see the woods for the trees
She built herself a time-bomb
A walking, talking time-bomb

She's sittin' on a time-bomb

If there's another day...try to make it right
Find another way...shine another light
So now they're both older...their world growin' colder
And nothin' appears as it seemed
They look to their future...and the wounds that they nurture
And try to hold on to their dreams
This terrible twosome have really been through some
Scenes that they both know by heart
Mem'ries that jail them...support that has failed them
And they laugh but it tears them apart
We're sittin' on a time-bomb
A ticking, talking time-bomb
It's about to explode under me
This world is like a time-bomb

"""NOW I'M EASY""
- Eric Bogle
For nearly sixty years, I've been a Cockie
Of droughts and fires and floods I've lived through plenty
This country's dust and mud have seen my tears and blood
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
I married a fine girl when I was twenty
But she died in giving birth when she was thirty
No flying doctor then, just a gentle old black 'gin
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
She left me with two sons and a daughter
On a bone-dry farm whose soil cried out for water
So my care was rough and ready, but they grew up fine and steady
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
My daughter married young, and went her own way
My sons lie buried by the Burma Railway
So on this land I've made me home, I've carried on alone
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
City folks these days despise the Cockie
Say with subsidies and dole, we've had it easy
But there's no drought or starving stock on a sewered suburban block
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
For nearly sixty years, I've been a Cockie
Of droughts and fires and floods, I've lived through plenty
This country's dust and mud, have seen my tears and blood
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
And now I'm easy

You see a lifetime of dreams
Scattered in the wind

Easier to say
And so sad the song
Of just remembering when
Knowing the love of your life
Will never come again

OP shirts and slip-on Vans.
My life was so simple
I had not one pimple,
My everyday was made up of these plans:
To ride my bike to Thrifty's,
Run past the balls and ice cream and
find the Star Wars figurines.
Thinking of my action men,
Kung-Fu grip and all,
What happened to them all?

Running through my old life
Looking for my lost toys
Where has all my fun gone?
Now that we're all older
Before we grow much colder
Let's all look forward to the new dawn
An anthem for all lost toys
Now that we're all big boys
We'll stand together and sing this song
We'll sing this song
It's not too long
So everybody sing along
When I was a little man
Playdough came in a little can
I was Star Wars' biggest fan
Now I'm stuck without a plan
GI Joe was an action man
Shaggy drove the mystery van
Devo was my favorite band
Take me back to my happy land
Now my brothers and sisters
I don't mean to make a scene
But I lost my action figures
and it makes me want to scream
Greedo, Chewbacca, Luke, R2, and Han,
3PO, Yoda, Bobafett, Obi Wan
Green Machine, Suckerman
Silly Putty, Lincoln Logs
Sitting in my Underoos
Reading christmas catalogs
What happened to my action men and all?
What happened to it all?

The nations' split by false hands
While their prize slowly vaporize
Into a steam that escape their eyes.
A fool is he who cannot foresee,
Hell is what this, our land will be.
Yes hell what is this, our land will be.
Do you hear the clarion call,
It's calling out to one and all.
Which side will finally prevail,
While the other side will fail.
How many pretenders can we endure?
The land is bleeding, so not many more.
Who may better the royal sceptre sway?
Questions, questions,
You'll see at the end of the day.",Metal

Performed by the isley brothers featuring ronald isley
Thank you, baby
For the years you've given me
For each beat of my heart
For every breath I breathe
Thank you, sweetie
For the best times of my life
Through the good, through the bad
You were always by my side
I never thought I'd meet someone
Who loves unselfishly
But I appreciate the way you loved and sacrificed for me
I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry 
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die 
Thank you, lady
For the joy you bring to life
When I thought all was lost and gone
You brought hope back in sight
Thank you, honey
For being my best friend
When I thought no one understood
You would always understand
I used to think that I knew love
And what true love should mean
Now I know that I did not know much
'cause you taught me everything
Hook
God so loved the world
That he blessed us all with you
And then he gave me a heart
Now I'm giving it to you
And these tears I cry are tears of joy
My happiness, I do rejoice
In the love you give unselfishly
Your constant sacrifice for me

"City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
You've got a new horizon It's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I want to hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I don't get sleep, no
Windmill, Windmill for the land
Learn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is stinking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining them up-a like ass cracks
Ladies, homies, at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate, ha ha ha
Yo, we gonna go ghost town
This Motown, with yo sound
You're in the place
You gonna bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With yo sound, you kill the INC
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar header
Yo, watch the way I navigate, ha ha ha

"*sounds of smoking, coughing, and choking*
""Do you know what's green?""
*DJ Pam cuts and scratches Cypress Hill ""puffin on a blunt""*

Last night I puffed on my last blunt, damn that was a stupid stunt
Cause I done said this ten times befo'
That when my life has come to a crescendo, I would let that indo go
But I'm still kissin it like I'm under the mistletoe
So here we go I'm Mork'in with the steady swagger
Speakin with a stunt, steady stagger preachin with a Southern drawl
That sounds like Jimmy Swaggart coughed and played it off
Said I know I'm flippin since the last one G my laces are tied
So you can't trip with me, I remember 1988 December
Someone said, ""Puff on this before you go up in her""
So I did it and I guess it must have did the trick
She enjoyed it so I guess I must have rocked the clit
Felt like a man and I loved her with an indo trip
Don't know why, cause I couldn't even feel my dick
Ego trip lasted and I'm always gettin blasted but it's drastic
Cause sometimes that shit can help you get your ass kicked
Can't buy it with plastic so I'm off to drain the vein for days
I get complaints, cause the neighbors say my house stink
Call myself a saint, cause I won't touch a bowl of food
I gives a fuck, just don't interrupt my Looney Tunes
This afternoon cause I can find a job anytime
Step off my behind I'm in a Doobie Brothers state of mind
Run-D.M.C., AT&T;, yo they both Be Illin'
I smoked that blunt for last month's three hundred dollar billin
And I'm willing to admit that when provoked I smoke to cope
But if I didn't take a toke I'd be leadin a street revolt
So I make a mental note, and to my frustration
I decide I can't do shit about the situation
Put the spliff to my lips, flick the Bic and it's on hit
Coulda been my last blunt... but I can't quit
Cause then I have to deal with, some motherfuckin real shit
Squeezin me tighter than you gotta squeeze a cow's tit
But on the flip tip I know I gotta get a grip
Even though in high school he used to be hip
*coughing*
But shit I'm hockin spit like I thought it was worth somethin
My throat can't take no more, no future in my frontin
But it's rough when you grow up and the tough men roll joints
That's why I been on the bench for marijuana to this point
But it don't faze me though I take it lacadaisical
It takes a while for ways to grow and get out of the old flow
But I'm an old bro, I done passed two decades
I'm wearin shades so my eyes don't reveal the red haze
Caused by my yung, cause days like Frankie Beverly
Amazin em back it's tried again, no roaches and no safety pins
Now I'm pennin rhymes about gettin on the wagon
And I get skittish when I think of how the British
Put the opium in Asia, fat one to that tactic
Gankin black folks while they daze ya, if you're gettin perved
You're gettin served this economic, like the gin and tonic
Brothers get moronic from the chronic bionic, and it's ironic
Cause we're not gettin fucked up, we're just gettin FUCKED
Shit out of luck and we're stuck with our mind in a muck
So don't duck the situation cause I used to smoke fat Taylors
Til I figured out that the ganjah was a jailor
Wait a, minute, while I get up in a funky situation
The Coup is coming through, and there's no hallucination
So what the fuck they say that junk is good for meditation
If you smoke a sack, take some Ex-Lax it's mental constipation
There's no hesitation when I'm talkin bout political friction
Stoppin evictions
Government made afflictions and I have an addiction
That's a big contradiction so I must confront it
Cause ain't no revolution gonna come from a blunt
*singers sing ""Put the blunt down, oooh-ooh!"" 2X*
My partner's cousin's uncle got killed by a shooter
I'm depressed so there's a rumor Boots is gonna hit the buddah
Mary Jane will be alone tonight the only type of hit in sight
Comes from Pam the Funkstress, give it to her

"I need advice it's true
but I won't hear it from you
I don't remember when
you last cared for the things I did
I wish I could believe
apply all the sides you've seen
or you could be the only one
who knows the truth of me
am I the ugly one
it's easy to see past
all of the kindness that you've offered me
it doesn't last
it's just a thought I've had

I came to think this way
maybe you'd understand me now
sometimes our enemies
are closer than we think
sometimes the ones we trust
may have to give up listening
I wish it were the same
as it is in my mind
I'd lie to learn a thing or two
give me a reason why
why am I not ashamed
while I am standing still
you want to move in me like you did before
but I've had my fill
you say your time has changed
that you have faced defeat
we might be older now
but is it changing anything
it could be in a way
we've learned to carry well
oh how I wish I could
remove this doubt I feel somehow
I want the best for you
so I won't look your way
maybe the clouds will clear
and I'll be seeing you someday

"Reflections staring back at me in a perfect world, through a modern dream.
And the pain they cause...its developing.
Through another time to scatter everything.
Through mistrust.
Through violence.
When does it end in silence?
We're living and dying.
It's not a way of life to live in hiding.
To take away a promise that we made before.
To creep between the lines that we can't afford.
All the patriotic sentiment, a fallacy of truth.
The time had come, we'd run away.
Away from all the youth.
To these days, where we are forced to raise ourselves, we divide, and we die.
It's never worth complaining when a life is on the line in your mind.
Relax, be strong.
Some fathers aren't heaven...haven't any names.
Some estranged to this world, and some play tired games.
And the pattern of the art of war represents disease.
I don't know who your are, so, how do you know me?
To these days, where we are forced to raise ourselves, we divide, and we die.
It's never worth complaining when a life is on the line in your mind.
Relax, be strong.
OUR time.
The pictures painted in our minds are all we have today.

"Lately I been waking to
The bluest stars that I once slept through
The morning hangs like open chords
That I fill in with my own thoughts and words
I used to worry all the time
But I slowed down to live my life
To live my life now
College campus and warmest grass
We sit and watch the people rush to class
When did we to decide that life had to be
All fasts and cheques, that we lost mystery
We used to worry all the time

To live our lives now",Indie

Se quedo en mi corazn

Ni se olvidara, que de pronto aun me suelo rer
De las cosas, que me recuerdan a ti

In grey stockings, in all might
It was no loss

In a sea of delight
To tame champagne

Filled his lungs inside out
I sold his gold
For flowers and rice
Speaking fire, he would hire
Pawns and peasants just like me
To feed upon the conquered ones

In Dofasco stinking air

Hold on to your aching heart
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips

He fades a bit and then he slips
Down into the blast furnace
In the heat of the open hearth
And at the punch clock he remembers
Blackhawk and the white winged dove

Pointing up into the sky
We fell down to our knees

While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

Young shawty I'm the pimp, so you know my game cold
Brush all my teeth cause my whole grill gold
Step out my house, pink gators on my toes
Tryna hit tha club before they all close
Hop in the Lac, Fleetwood eight four
Twenty inch G's with tha triple gold spokes
Creep in the door with my pockets on swole
Limp across tha flo like both of my legs broke
Slide to tha bar to get me somn cold
Got a glass of Thunderbird cause I can't stay in mode
Put down my glass and hit tha dance flo
Don't get mad at me boy what you cuffin my hands for
If I want it I'ma get it ya know how my game go
? I'm pullin ya main woe
I'm chargin for this game, I'm givin you lames yos
Gotta line these girls up in a soul train row
I hit tha V.I.P. just to get my mind blown
Do I see Mista G he got that fire dro
All tha hataz in tha club what ya rollin ya eyes fo
Cause ya mad i'm pushin good and pimped out tha side door

While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

Now when I hop off in tha Lac, I swerve tha interstate
Just because I'm cheifin dro and i'm smugglin heavy weigh
Keep tha hood bout my G's and break um off a K
And sip on Hennessy till I start to hallucinate
Pull my way down tha block cause its mo money to make
And plus I got some mo cookie dough I need to bake
But you can buy a bag of mine and I betcha you gon' be straight
Cause tha soft ain't got no cut and tha wood ain't got no shape
Cause tha fiends run to me whenever they want to taste
Cause they say that mine taste like baked potato and steak
Well excuse me if I done took all yo pay
Cause I just set up shop and been workin for one day
You say you want to rob me, well hell that's a mistake
Cause I got atomic bombs that cause tha Earth to quake
It'll open all tha gates and cause heaven to shake
It not God man its me, cause I destroyed tha place
All because of this devious busta who tried to hate
When all he had to do was ask, instead he tried to take
So to stop all of that and keep my soul safe
I just hop in my Lac and head tha other way

While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

It's about 2:45 and we at tha red light
Looked in my mirror, and saw some head lights
Now any other time it would be aight
But tha group done checked around when ya on tha westside
Put my foot to tha flo, doin bout eighty five
Hit Fairview, headed to Riverside
They behind us kinda close, so hell I bust a ride
Ran on tha curb and scrubbed my damn tire
Man can't you mash tha gas and dash up outta sight
What ya talkin bout, I'm doin a bill five
I could pick up mo speed on a ten speed bike
Oh you tryna joke, better hope we don't die
Since we ain't packin gats it seems we gotta fight
When I throw a left, you best to throw a right
Pull up in tha cut so they can pass us by
Get down in yo seat and get off tha brake light
They pulled up in tha back and blocked us from behind

He said listen heyah Dirty, why you tryna hide

On the dark road to bring back the sunshine

And as long as niggas out here gettin' paid
Back to my old ways, who they gonna run and tell, huh?

Just You Wait till it Happens to You
I can get no attentionand your arms love to pick on me
I just wonder why you do me like you do
Just you wait till it happens to you
Now youre sittin there and youre laughin
So I guess the jokes on me
I just wonder why you do me like you do

Then youll realize the true friends that you had",R&B

I hate this mess, boy, you just ain't no good for me
This ain't the way real love should be

They said your tricks were over
Boy, you've gon' crossed the line
Took you back once, took you back twice

I've been tryin' to hold it down, and you steady tellin' me it's over now

That's just what we go through, and you know it's so true
Every time I slip up she behind me, gon' be right there to remind me...

And I had to deliver, but I been so caught in my hustle, tryin' to make this payment
And I should've considered your feelings
I should've been better about it
I should've been grown, not childish
I should've been way more polished
But my hustle done paid off, and I'm ready to spoil you, love

Want sunshine, then take a vacation

It's full of happy and sad faces, break it up to make up later

"The light is shining
Still I'm not so surprised
One thousand voice mails
For one thousand lies
Blind faith, lost trust
All along it was plain to see
Years passed, lost touch
Leads the path to insanity
Take another shot, show me what you got
It was never gonna last forever
Open your eyes, try and realize
Once is enough so tonight now I say
No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right
Dark nights, long passed
Waking up from a pointless dream
Brighter days, brighter times
Hides the fatal reality
Questions, answers
False addiction to nothing real
Lights fade, crushed to dust
Desperation in tragedy
Take another shot, show me what you got
It was never gonna last forever
Open your eyes, try and realize
Once is enough so tonight now I say
No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right
 Same old game we play together
 Time will pass, we'll still remember
 But tonight this game is over
 Strangers in the night forever
No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight

"Baby, I've been waiting,
I've been waiting night and day
I didn't see the time,
I waited half my life away
There were lots of invitations
And I know you sent me some
But I was waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come
I know you really loved me
But, you see, my hands were tied
And I know it must have hurt you,
It must have hurt your pride
To have to stand beneath my window
With your bugle and your drum
And me I'm up there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come
Ah I don't believe you'd like it,
You wouldn't like it here
There ain't no entertainment
And the judgments are severe
The Maestro says it's Mozart
But it sounds like bubble gum
When you're waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come
Waiting for the miracle
There's nothing left to do
I haven't been this happy
Since the end of World War II
Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
Waiting for the miracle to come
I dreamed about you, baby
It was just the other night
Most of you was naked
Ah but some of you was light
The sands of time were falling
From your fingers and your thumb
And you were waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come
Ah baby, let's get married
We've been alone too long
Let's be alone together
Let's see if we're that strong
Yeah let's do something crazy,
Something absolutely wrong
While we're waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come
Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
Waiting for the miracle to come
When you've fallen on the highway
And you're lying in the rain,
And they ask you how you're doing
Of course you'll say you can't complain
If you're squeezed for information,
That's when you've got to play it dumb
You just say you're out there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come",Rock

I have no clue what you are about to do, I have this thing and it's for you

Last night I talked to you for a while, i was intrigued about your style
you hammered me away
I can't speak clearly I can't think, I thought I was the missing link,
that would put together the chain
I thought I was your missing link
but now I know I was so wrong
I thought I was your missing link

What's the good, it's too late now

But why should you listen to friends dear

for our own safety

for you to hear our cries

of inhuman culture
before disappearance
went right through us

So I blame the ones that I love
When I am no one to act as a judge

Shadowed only by the land it has become.
Theres fog across the mountainside still I am shrouded in the light,
Theres nothing left in all the world from which to run.

The air is cold and time is far behind
And Ive been high now for a little while
And now my eyes are open wider than they ever were
I was stranded on a fishing boat abandoned in the storm
Solitude can lead your self out of the door
We only live for seconds in the relativity of all
Yet the majority of our ideals are flawed
I have been lost now for a little while
I was troubled by the silence of the night
And Ive been high now for a little while
And now Im leaving all my past
Im driving forward with the wind beside me
As masterplans
Fall into motion

On the outside of the windowpane

Make childish issues into wars

Dirty old town, dirty old town
Heard a siren from the dock
Saw a train set the night on fire

Shining steel tempered in the fire

Lives through the dusty
Pebbles while thrusting
Them onto the pond

He followed horrible advice
And hollowed his account
With a roll of the dice twice
Now the market's a rollercoaster ride

With no retirement in sight

Can't sit back

He's got to be moving faster
Today he's older
Tomorrow he's older than today
He's got to get bolder before he's older
And throws his life away
Those damn revelations
Running around his head
Increasing frustration
And motivation
Look he's scared to death
He's got to do something today
Before the terrorists start attacking
Before foreign policy instigates another Iraqi
With a suitcase who wants to blow himself up for Allah
Better to die chasing a dream than regret not trying at all
Tick tock the clock is getting faster
Can't sit back
And watch the world move backwards
He's got to be moving forwards
He's got to be moving faster
Passes time to forget time is passing him by
Tick tock the clock is getting faster
Can't sit back
And watch the world move backwards
He's got to be moving forwards
He's got to be moving faster

"Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
Where on the brink of love I kissed her and obeyed my heart's command
Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
We watched the sunset in the evening in a far and distant land
Oh here beneath God's blue heaven there's a place I must go
And the sunset in the evening is the only love I know
Where the deep blue pearly waters...

We watched the sunset in the evening seen the moon still low and pale
Watched the gaucho ride the pinto out across the pampas trail
Where the deep blue pearly waters...
And obeyed my heart's command",Country
"You can live your life in a crowded city,
You can walk along a crowded street.
But the city really ain't no bigger than the friendly
People, friendly people that you meet.
You might be a sweet young, sweet young pretty, pretty,
And at the dances you can't keep your seat.
But, if dances don't lead to romances,
You might as well be born, be born with two left feet.
You might be a sweet-toned sure 'nuff high-class talker,
You might be a stone, stone expert at kissing.
But it don't do too much good to be talkin',
Brother, when there ain't no, ain't nobody lis'nin'.
And if you are shy, just not much of a talker,
Don't impress the people that you meet.
You might as well be a lonely walker in a lonely town, on a lonely street.",R&B

Creepin' so I'm cautious
Catch a nigga sleep, six feet deep

Rip all of your soldiers scream but no body heard ya
Then pop in the clip if ya lettin' me doze off, you lost
Creepin', I'm drunk when I stalk me victim
Sleepwalk with the intent to kill him
Woke up and my shovel done soaked in blood
Put 'em in the mud
Don't know what it was but his gut was
Still drippin' off me fuckin' gloves, then I got me strapped up
Straight-jacked up, but man I'll be reapin'
Creepin' up under your dome, it's seepin'
When the sawed off get to creepin', fall victim
Me stalkin', chalkin' up bloody victims
Rest, the Ripsta, the sinister kill a nigga
Put him in a river, bodies shiver, pump blood now
Wanna rest with the Mo Thugs, buckin' 'em on down
What is it in ya, deep in the dead and we get fried
P.O.D. D when it comes to ride
Creep out your seat, but don't fall in the night
Once inside, forgettin' about remors forgettine
Tour curse'll ride, cry now when I'm ready to lie down
Then I awake in a mental state somebody gotta die now
I'll pap pap puttin' a clack back in a me gat
Not never to mention never to mention
It'll be over when I take a nap, me deadly
But then me put in the bullet, the wickedness in me
And I'm on a mission on murder
Roll city to city without no pity
Well, I got a clique see

Peep me creepin' out of the corner

Once the Mo comes up ther's gonna be murder
Killer when the night falls
And it ain't shit to kill, 'cuz I really don't love ya
Don't run, run, run, I like my knife
Run up with that gun, gun, gun, and take your life

"God dammit Amy, we're not kids any more.
You can't just keep waltzing out of my life,
Leaving clothes on my bedroom floor,
Like nothing really matters, like pain doesn't hurt.
You should be more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt.
You kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I made when I was a kid,
With a disassembled disposable razor I stole from my dad,
When I thought that suffering was something profound,
That weighed down on wise heads,
And not just something to be avoided,
Something normal people dread.
God dammit Amy, well of course I've changed.
With all the things I've done and the places I've been
I'd be a machine if I had stayed the same.
But you're still back where we started, you haven't changed at all.
You're still trying to live like a kid, like you can always have it all.
You know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I hid as best I could,
That I covered with ink, but in the right kind of light they still bleed through,
Showing that there are some things I just can't change no matter what I do:
The tell-tale signs of being used,
Of being trapped inside of you.
You're a beautiful butterfly
Burned with a branding iron
Onto my outsides into my insides
As a simple sign:
To show off your ownership.
Burned into my naked skin,
Onto my outsides into my insides.
It's not even love any more,
It's just a claim upon my soul.
It stains my skin, yeah it's on my breath,
And I'm ashamed to get undressed
In front of strangers in case they see
The tell tale signs that you have left all over me.
God dammit Amy.
You'll always remind me of scars on my arms that I know will never fade.
And it's not like it's something I think about each and every day -
I just occasionally catch myself scratching them, as if they'd ever go away.
But these tell tale signs are here to stay, and in the end you know that's OK.
You will always be a part of my patched-up patchwork taped-up tape-deck heart.",Indie
"Ooh, ooh
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever cry yourself to sleep?
In the middle of the night when you're awake,
Are you calling out for me?
Do you ever reminisce?

I know it's crazy
How I still can feel your kiss
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours
Since you went away
I miss you so much and I don't know what to say
I should be over you
I should know better but it's just not the case
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours
Since you went away
Do you ever ask about me?
Do your friends still tell you what to do?
Every time the phone rings,
Do you wish it was me calling you?
Do you still feel the same?
Or has time put out the flame?

"Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop  and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods; I don't believe the news
Or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again
You know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we got is lettin' a person feel that they're important
And a man can't get himself together until
He knows who he is and be proud of what and who he is
And where he come from, and where he come from
Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
Them guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans
You know, you know, you know,
One way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is
Lettin' a person feel that they're somebody
And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is,
And be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from",Hip-Hop

I seek souls like mines
so my mind finds inner peace
and then a beast
could never devour
my powers arrive
from survivors of this holocaust.
Please be hopeful,
never thinkin' all is lost
in my sector,
specter
slidin',
collidin' with my lifestyle
so I fight while they threaten me,
sweatin' me -
well I'm quite mild,
the world makes me gnarly,
but an introvert not hardly.
I deal with it.
I feel a bit
under the weather,
I need to pull my pieces back together.
Fallin' apart, stallin' a heart of sincerity
since there will be another stoplight
and its not right
so I might go insane of this brain
of mine
maintain a line that has been tame
before the tempest.
I'm looking to my better interests.
I never tried to post or tried to impress
anyone
so why do I got to suffer
every single day it seems the way of the world is rougher.
And then you wonder why I love to hallucinate,
because I never ever thought I would get used to hate.
So I imbedded my time within my mind,
and rhymin'
was the only way I kept from bein' confined
to quarters,
sure there's good times and bad,
but the bad time's are overwhelming,
and how the hell things
get out of hand I ask you,
you have to give an answer;
eating at my brain like it was cancer.
Worryin'.
Hurryin',
My thought processes.
I got offices
imbedded in my skull,
a million secretaries actin' scary
when they type 200 words per minute.
It just occurred to me I'm in it.
'Cause I'm the boss,
the head honcho,
at least to this mutiny.
The whole idea is cute to me.
so I entertain it
and let my brain get
deeper and deeper
until it vibrates like a beeper
and I can't maintain it.
So what's the verdict?
It's D.E.L. the visionary and I come with the absurd shit.

If I had not one friend I would be gooooone.
Way in outer space singin' one sooooong:
'Zippety doo dah, zippety day,
my oh my what a wonderful day
when my mind's dusted'.
Thrusted
out beyond the stars, I'm the satellite.
Transmittin, fit in situations that'll rattle tikes -
scare 'em,
dare 'em to go farther.
So then I go father,
burnin' my brain out with mental lava.
Scalding,
all things
rearrange so I never socialize,
when you feel my eyes.
The dilated pupils,
I violated scruples,
'cause I told myself I'd never do it again,
but now I grin.
Laugh on the inside,
men tried to strap me
in a straight jacket
when I laugh and I'm happy
for two hours straight,
these powers hate me
and they make me wanna cower,
but lately I've been feeling like a tower.
Tall and sturdy,
wordy, though I never say a word,
'cause when I say a word,
before it's like they never heard.
Nothing ever changes except within my cerebellum,
so I'll never tell 'em,
never tell 'em,
never tell 'em.
I'll tell it to my soul over and over
even though I'm locked within a room with padded walls,
I'm never sober.
Inspections,
injections,
keep me confined
to my inner thoughts
and this is how I lost my mind.

"Though your dark eyes, you can feel my every sin
When I walk right into a straight line, this world of yours
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
You're the fall guy in the corner of my gloom
And it feels like everything I see is nothing new
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye again
There's a door there that opens without you
And the door lies with open keys to my room
Flame of the torchlight fill my thighs, fulfill
As I crave, I consume 'em but I don't give

I wanna say it now for now is today
A love has been given so why not enjoy
So let's all grab and let's all enjoy

If the kids are united then we'll never be divided
Just take a look around you, what do you see?
Kids with feelings like you and me
Understand him, he'll understand you
For you were him, and he was you
If the kids are united then we'll never be divided
If the kids are united then we'll never be divided
I don't want to be rejected
I don't want to be denied
Then its not my misfortune
That I've opened up your eyes
Freedom is given to speak how you feel
I have my freedom, how do you feel?
They can lie to my face but not to my heart
If we all stand together it will just be the start
If the kids are united then we'll never be divided

lemonade . I met you another
year later, you wore a RED SWEATER with an alligator. We chased the ice
cream truck across the street and I
thought you seemed kind of neat. We held hands as we walked to the
swings in the park.
You're my girl, I'm your man. I don't care if we live in a
garbage can. I'm your man, you're my gal, I'm so
glad that we are pals.
You're not fat - you don't smell bad. You're always smiling - never sad.
I bet you take a shower every day... hey
hey hey hey hey.
But then when I saw you playing soccer with your friends, I knew that
day our love would never end.
And this whole time it blows my mind, oh well whatever - we're so good
together, when you matty me you'll be my
wife.
I'm in love, its great, see you again - can't wait, there's so much to
do. You're such a pretty girl, we'll travel round
the world, to see this love through.
And if you ever went away from me. I would cry, I would fall down on one
knee. And I would pray, Yes I would
pray, that you would come back to me someday....

Driving much faster now
Out on the highway
10 miles out on the road

Now where should we go
Nothing can take us out
or can stop us now.
This story is for you.
This story is for me.

with stories for you.Holding on to the ground.
Holding on for your sound.

Our ships never breaking down
Well what would we know
It makes such a lovely sound
Hits such a sweet note
I'll sing you a song of love
with headlines from above
I'm holding on to the headlines
With stories for you.
I'm holding on to the ground
Holding on for your sound
I'm holding on to the headlines
The things that ring true
The engines are shaking now
our ship is lifting off the ground.
Hold on darling
It's such a sweet taste
There's nowhere to run to now
But into Your grace
Nothing can stop us now
Our ships' lifting off the ground.",Indie

If you're not in our gang, you might as well be dead.
One, get a knife or a gun. Two, get some name brand shoes.
Three, by some jnco jeans. Four, buy some more.
Five, talk like a gangsta. Six, dress like a gangsta.
Seven, listen to G-boy gangsta music. Eight, cause trouble and be full of hate.
Nine, pretend to be so tough. Ten, get a rude attitude.

"SHEPHERD OF MY HEART
Writer Jenny Lou Carson
You're the shepherd of my heart so treat it tenderly
It's a heart that needs your ever-loving care
You're the shepherd of my heart until eternity lead it not into the valley of despair
While it's in your keeping guard it with your love
Shelter it from harm along life's way
You're the shepherd of my heart and darling honestly
It's a heart that will not ever go astray
You're the shepherd of my heart so surely you must know
You have but to speak and my heart will obey
It's at your command my dear because it loves you so
So my darling shepherd guide it where you may
If it be green pastures or a rocky road it will follow you and not ask why
You're the shepherd of my heart until the trumpet blows
And I go to meet the shepherd in the sky",Country

Through my thoughts and my actions
And the things that I've said
Sometimes by mistake and sometimes on purpose, Amen

Got a black Mac 11 and it hit like a Mac truck
Product of bad luck, play it out on that movie screen
And to scope with some killers, almost die for moving green

My grandmama died at 18, left me all alone
All I got is my guns, bandanas, some weed
Left me with 2 dead brothers, my enemies gon' bleed
I'm masked up, suicidal, rest in peace to Hayes
Wasn't no killers where my niggas seen some better days

Gotta pull that vest out

Laid out in the street, let his mama cry
White chalk, black streets
Red rag, coke killer, watch 'em leak
Black on black crimes
Killing our own brothers
But what the fuck can we do
When you got on the wrong colors?
Take a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off
On that Impala, hit the switch, lay it low
Soon as you walk out the crib, we gon' blast
Hit the 110 and now the one time on your ass
In 4 minutes, you thought that you got away with it
Thought that shit was a dream, let us pray
'Cause when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes

A brown crust on my fingernails
A sudden pain in my back reminds me of my dream last night
I'm close to you and take your hand
You trust in me but I wouldn't feel safe

The marks on my wrist make me shiver
When I went to bed they weren't there
My shirt's torn apart, dried blood adorns the sleeves
I'm feeling empty inside
Murders at night
I freeze to death again
The urge will be victorious again
I'm burning once again
The figures of disguise
What happened last night? I can't remember
What have I done when I thought I'm asleep?
The wounds burn, a light wind brings relief - an irony
I look into your eyes, embrace your neck
A graceful sight, I'm choking more and more
Your fingernails furrow my skin
I smile - suddenly you are still
My desperation never comes to an end
I wash my hands and I'm mirrored
The shapeless face on my body smiles at me
My victim of last night",Rock

Fury of the darkest evil cry for war
Far beyond the boundaries of hell and starlight
On the road to lands unknown forever more
Through the caverns far below our quest will lead us
Onwards through the ice and snow forever more
Standing fighting full of hate the time has come now
Stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war
On wings of glory we will carry on
Far across forgotten lands towards the distant sun
And in the darkness shinning far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come
Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Trough the forced of power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, fury of the storm!
We are the chosen one we can not fail now
Spilling all the blood on the fires below
Smashing through the boundaries with the fire and fury
Killing all the mortals down the winding road
Hell fires are raging the storm growing strong
On the path to victory towards the distant sun
And in the darkness shinning far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come",Metal

I take out them older brothas
Started out sellin' marijauna
But now I'm sellin' yola
Shit was gettin' hella funky at first
When a nigga was snatchin' up bitches purse
Ended up gettin' kicked up outta school in Vallejo
They clocked me like a circus

I was the 'lil mannish mufucka showin' out in the back of the church
My momma was quick to hit me witta switch and I'd say that hurts
Get to the house, start some shit and start some trash
I never believed a hard head made a soft ass
'Cause I be movin' fast and I be tryin'na stash
Beat up the pizza man and I straight dash
Disobedient sports cut my days short
My mama got tired of takin' my ass back and forth to court
I said momma I'mma straighten up for you and I promise that I'mma work
Got me a job as a paper boy, 21 dollars a month
5 o'clock in the morning, damn I'm slavin' for the fuckin' white man
21 dollars might buy me some porage call me chicken George
I'm tired of muthafuckas fuckin' over me
How can I find a way to make some real money?
But you don't feel me, I was tired of being broke lookin' tore down
I came up off a twenty dollar break me down
Next thang you know, I was up to about a quarter of a key ballin'
Niggaz wuz trippin' off me cause I was a young muthafucka ballin'
Gettin' my fetti on but when it was funk I had to stall
Time to go get them choppers and bring out the u-haul
I'm extra mannish-I make ya vanish-I play for keeps
Investigate that ass till I find out where you sleep

Bars nuttin', best believe that I'mma bring the uh
Fully automatic tommy with the info red and say I'm sorry
Before I pump yo ass fulla lead and dump the body
""Extra mannish"" thats what people be callin' me
Oh we can be cool until you gets to threatenin' me
I lose my temper and shit, my eyes turn red
Blow my top and get real hot at the head
I guess I'mma failure, I got no future in my frontin'
All I'm able to do is sell dope and hit the blunt
Don't ask me why? Sometimes I go to church and testify
The preacher preaches and I be dang near ready to cry
Rebuke the devil, I gotta get up out the ghetto free
Sometimes I wonder if mommy and daddy was ever payin' me
Who would ever think that a nigga like me
Would become such a bad ass youngster?
My mommy and daddy done fucked around and created a damn monster
Why didn't I wait till I was bigger, before I started drinkin' malt liquor?
I guess I was a nappy headed stubborn 'lil mannish ass nigga
Guess who comes thru

Its me the Y O U N G M U T Z
I'm just as mannish as I wanna be I pack a 30-30
Niggaz wanna blast me because I'm down and dirty
Extra mannish is how I'm livin' and I'm fuckin' my neighbors bitch and
She's lovin' every minute of the dick that I be givin'
Bitches on my jock bitches on my jock
Niggaz on the block know I got a glock
Bean cocks, Pecos, and all that

"Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Centuries through mankind's eyes
In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself
Slowly walking, pacing front
See through these blind eyes
Stepping on shadows, touching air
Stones move as I stand still
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes
In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself
For years of space technology
Still we haven't learned
Like children we explore
Things we can't yet comprehend
Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Carrying our own cross
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes",Metal
"Bust it
Hey yo, I just left the studio, and it's about 2 in the morn'
I just finished doin a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
In this good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jumped in the jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep
My voice is harsh, barely can speak
I called back on the cell
It's Coley, mad as hell
He told me to listen well as he started to yell
""I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room in the Holiday Inn""
""It's my wife, you sure?""
""Yeah I'm sure
I saw the whore as soon she walked through the door""
""Yo, say no more, which one?""
""The one in Jersey, son, right over the bridge""
""We goin' hurt those hoes""
""And hurt both of them kids""
Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change
I can't wait to touch the lames and them fuckin dames
Reach the destination, grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Coleone holdin the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cup
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
""Yo, who that in the background?""
""It's Tommy Giss""
""Oh, I didn't recognise you with your hat down
Son you ready, we got this whole shit mapped out""
""Yeah, wo goin to take the backroute
And pull our gats out and throw our mask on
We ain't leavin till everyone's dead and all the cash gone""
""We goin to get our laugh on when we're through
But right now we got a job to do""
""So let's do it""
Hey yo, I stepped to the deskclerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her to listen up before she get hurt
""They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?""
She paused and said ""212""
Took the steps now I'm out of breath
I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes goin be the cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pase
I felt disgraced, I should've shot the bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in
Each had a cannon
Ready to take care, how we done planned it
""These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate""
We know they got stacks
Cause they don't move with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the ducktape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we be lettin 'em loose
""Hey man, I kicked Mike in his face
So I just had your back
You want to live and tell my nigga where the stash at""
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 keys in a stash
A 100 pound of grass, and 2 million in cash
I was dumb glad
The sit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth
And put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Coley done popped them punks
""Hey yo', fuck it L, we might as well pop these studs""
Man that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money threeways
Now we all laughin hard, gettin nice and weeded

I'm worried you working so late
Is it just your job that keeps you away, Lord
I know the temptations are gray
I'm just a wife, I'm just a momma
It's not too exciting I know
He pulled me close and whispered those same words
He told me that night long ago

"I remember the day the day
When I had to take you to the airport
And put you on a plane
And so you left me
Left me alone on an empty tube train
Deep under the ground
While you were bathed in sunlight
High above the clouds
I needed you here
To be my sunshine in London town
California's had more than its fair share
You left me to these small skies
And to rain-soaked concrete
To Morrissey and Robert Smith
And complicated streets I know
On which you lost your patience and your way
The way you always did on steel gray rainy days
I needed you here
To be my sunshine in London town
California's had more than its fair share
Of beating summer sun and shining seas
But it doesn't have a shred of honesty
I know the truth, yeah, Neil Young
And Joni Mitchell were Canadians
I guess that makes sense, they had their fill
And then they moved away again
You're not alone, we all sometimes
Use words that we don't understand
Your love was only just skin deep
And in the end it gave me cancer
You might have been my sunshine
But I'd rather have a rainy day
California gets just what it deserves",Indie

Never can decide which one, to give juice to, hah

And if baby want to flip, she can, skip
Similar to rattles, so I apply the proper poetry used
to gets flames thrown promptly, with my prowess

So now you need to learn or know like I know
The info, is in Me-O-Mi-O-Why

This one rude individual when my mood is in the critical
stages it's pitiful the way I get the pull
Flame from the mysteries, so I twist the G's that's around me
Releasing frustration by clowning
But now think of those who ain't exposed behind closed doors
That I post more than I really do
But really who's to blame? No scapegoat, I just shape dope
Wishin to make over a career
But will I say, when my parents say, rap won't stay
Don't they know, yet they won't show, as I flow
Keepin the rhymes constant, John spent, time in rhymin
So I'm sure that I'm gonna get mine then

First Country caught a body, then country caught a body then
I popped a couple niggas, then country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit you got to love it
Tre-Eight Snub it, and don't think nuttin' of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it poppin' when we shoppin' niggas hold down the two's
I seen niggas gettin' rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of havin' shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggas gettin' hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slingin' that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am
Yeah
I was ? since we was little niggas son since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his can we were seven
He a lucky muhfucker I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fuckin' stash up
I had two-hundred and fifty grams stashed on the porch
I mean I'm what you call smoke man, I'm what you call snort
First the VCR went, then the T.V. went
He stole outta mommy purse, she thought it was me kid
I ain' ask her for no money son cause I was out hustlin'
She was lookin' at me sideways like I'm a thief or somethin'
That hurt me, c'mon son that wouldn't hurt you
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub
The Lord don't have imperfections baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazin'
I seen niggas gettin' rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of havin' shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by

"In you I was invited
So in your arms I'll die
Every other man got away
But I won't even try
Twenty coins in your pocket
Twenty nails in your coffin
With faith and salvation
Oh you must be joking
Now the moon has a watchful eye
And it bleeds in the sky
And the red rock drips on rocket ships
And you hid your eyes
cause you just couldn't take it
Years of delusion put scars on your face
And we'd make the earth quake
With every step that we'd take
You're hung on your mission
Of destroying your vision
Constricted and timid
you're a time bomb ticking
All the heavens in the clouds
Are a pendelum swinging down
So hurry up young man
Go and bury your head
And know no one's around right now
to water the ground
Hey big daddy what's on your mind?
All the things that you're thinking of
All the time
Is it heresy to speak of
Or an undying love?
If you told me it wouldn't change me
You said you'd act boldly
But your hesitating
Now I'll escape and I'll never come back around
Well you won't learn nothing
Until you bend down and taste the ground
Taste the ground
All the colors, grey
In your head made of hay
Won't you take me now?
For the hearst will stop
Then the flesh will rot
And the blood moon we see is an act
It's an act of god",Country
"Now tell me where could I go but to the Lord
Living below in this old sinful world hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation sore where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end  where could I go but to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so dear comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face the chilling hand of death where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go...
Where could I go...",Country

Where's the party at

Forget it man, I can't lie
I'm drunk as a skunk but I'm nothin' funk
I shoots the game, the gift I spit
The gift of gab boy, the gift is ripped
Deal with the skill that makes ya feel it
Those that don't wanna feel it need to kill it
Knows that I can giddy go
When it's time to get on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E
It's me the hustler 40
With them raggedy seperaters as if it was funky
A brother like me don't hang around no suckers that be faulty
I be puttin' the group up in the boot
Be puttin' the peas up in the pod
Left the cookies in the jar, now I'm a rap star
The rapologist, I pull a 40 out of my ball cap
Then I bust ya down side of this
Cause partner ain't never been no punk in this
I'm so serious brother, I got meals, wheels
And about seven thousand dollars worth of bills
Givin' up deals, hills let em' go for a lil' nothin'
As I showcase my skills for real

There's a party over here, a party over there
A party everywhere...put ya hands up
There's a party over here, a party over there
A party everywhere

Pullin' up in the club about eleven
I plays my feet and hit the beat and kept it revvin'
I got a lil' doja that I'm fixin' to break down
Roll em' up in a zag, lick em' stick em' and clown
I'm fully dig with a dick, my game is on hit
I got tipped so I tip cause I'm livin' with this
Game tight with the knack, I'm pullin' in scratch
They better have a tight grip on they stuff cause I'm bout to snatch
Your batch if she wants it she'll be mine in the Cutlass
Puffin' on some of this chronic while I'm gettin' straight laced
Heard about the drought season, they be lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feastin'
Extra manish how I'm livin' and my name is groupie
It's Mr. 30-30 givin' up game to all you hoochies
Bitches always splittin' stick the wood but sometimes wouldn't
Suckin' and grabbin' my little pecker
Talkin' about sick on my gold better
I remember when carts was Barbie cut before I was in junior high
All they wanted to do is kiss and let me play with they vagina
I got my freshen up, I put on my chucks, also down with pluck
Th finest watch on the playground, the one with the big ass butt
40 I love you, I miss you, I need you
And retrospect to who
Bitch come anew, bitch come anew


Cause we made like thugs
Get juiced in the parking lot before we go up in the clubs
Hugs and kisses, gotta make sure we got our gloves
Hugs and kisses, E-40 can't be on any more
Hugs and kisses, straight to the bar no time to waste
Kickin' em' back while they take the place
Order me a shot of that liquor to taste
Thinkin' they about to beat my face
Oh no, I'm nothin' but a professional
Oh no, we're nothin' but professionals
Hoochies all in my face with some of that dope water
Brothers already purple off some of that soap water
So I'ma make a toast to the most
Mobbish lookin' brothers in this by midnight
Cause brothers gotta get the shit that's really in man
Batches on our jock, batches on our jock
Mind teachin' things to these brothers
Cause that's us, Captain Save a botch
They wanna be like big boys and sport big loot
They wanna be like big boys and sport fresh suits
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me

Learn to live again

"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain
A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you
First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you
Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Moppin' so no slippin'
No one wants to get caught by someone else trippin'
And why do the people here all make a fuss
Of throwing other co-workers under the bus?
And why don't they see you don't get paid that much more
Playing office politics like I even want to work here?

On the field I can see a fiddler

Would you mind
Would you mind
If I take you

Her face was pale
Her body smashed
Her beauty's gone

He is quite alone here

Cleaning our plates like some kind of a race
We finished our meal without making a sound
I glanced at him, he flagged the waitress down
She brought us our check and said will that be all
He said, yeah thanks, and sent her off with a nod
I'm sure she was thinking, I don't know about those guys
But when she counted her tip, she had to smile
What I got from him is my stubborn side
and the tapping my fingers on the wheel when I drive
And the gift of keeping strangers an arms length away
Not knowing what I'm thinking behind my poker face
When I'm stuck in a crowd at a party somewhere
With people that I'm supposed to know
I don't do small talk, but I'll shake your hand
You'll wonder about me, and I'll consider us friends
What I got from him is my quiet side
And annoying everybody with how slow I can drive
And the habit of never calling anybody by name
So they're never quite sure if I know who they are
As they try to read my poker face
If you see us out at some little caf,
cleaning our plates like some kind of a race
And you can't figure out if we're happy or mad
That's the way that we like it, me and my dad
I tend to be a little bit cheap,

Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red

He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk

Because his heart was made of knoty pine

If I was a truckin' man
I'd be a gear jammer with a one-armed tan
I'd spend my nights in the roadhouse
Days on the lost highway
Hey, if I was a truckin' man
I'd have my radio screamin' on the AM band
All night drivin' by dashboard lights
If I was a truckin' man

Pushin' these number two pencils everyday
This rat race don't fit into my plan, no ma'am

Drinkin' my coffee, smokin' my smokes all night

"Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
But a name don't mean wealth, let me up you on this shit
If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
I spit game on a regular basis, now everybody
Looking at my hand like I'm holding all the aces
Cool that they know our faces, from different places
But you can't catch up if you don't know what the pace is
Everywhere we go you know especially in the O we hear
""Coup, Coup, you know we got love fo' sho'""
But even mo' when they see us on B-E-and-T and
M-T-and-V but me and E can't pay the P-G-and-E
Power come from the barrel of a bucker
I use the mic so that we aim at the same motherfucker
'Cause your shit could go gold, and the only cash you got
Is the silver kind that don't fold
I'm gettin' dope when they ask about the road that I passed
My peoples really be thinking they gon' come up fast
If they can rap and shake they ass
You ain't the first motherfucker who done scheme to scam
Then plan to scram up out the ghetto let me break this down
From kids to Grams, fuck the videos with the Benzes
And the cellular phones, spending hundreds like quarters
The Benz is they partner's, the money's on loan, and umm...
""The cellular number you have reached is out of order.""
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
But a name don't mean wealth
Let me up you on this shit
If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves
But a name don't mean wealth
Well let me up you on this shit!
If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
I mocked Rock Box wearin' socks in my basement, told my pops
I'm finna to have as much mail as they got, not
I still plot to keep my cash clot flowin'
My mind is bent on the rent, I'm barely makin it microphonin'
It's true, it's a few getting fund expansions
It ain't like Acorn Projects gon' move into mansions
Straight authenticized shit, over synthesized hits
With this misty eyed 'mental make your teeth grit
And I'm not tryin' to diss like it's a bandwagon trend
They selling six-packs of them wavies out the ghetto again
In the 20's it was rocks, in the 50's doo-wop
It's nineteen-ninety-fo' and everybody's store hop'n
And ain't nobody really trying to hear me speak it
They too busy watchin' Luke, gettin' interviewed by Robin Leach
So if you're modest and don't hire economics
Just kick it with The Coup, smoke this dub sack of funk!
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
But a name don't mean wealth
Let me up you on this shit
If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves
But a name don't mean wealth
But let me up you on the shit!
If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
I'm gon' die before I lie to my peoples on the block
It's like frontin' you gon' shoot when you ain't got no Glock
You bet' not  this is how we run shit
I'm finna to pitch a fit 'cause I'm tired of hearing dumb shit
Why do motherfuckers get up out and go for single
When the real high rollers draft a army to protect they Pringles?
Confusion, just a system based on prostitution
They done ganked you, don't be no stank fool with they solution
Unless you got about a million semi-automatics
You gon' think you strivin' doin' them ho-style acrobatics
No I don't have it like that, Planned Parenthood ain't got it
I keep my whole life savings stuffed in my back pocket, flock it
I'm scraping fronts off like plaque, no slack
I come realistic like Radio Shack
Intact and fat motherfuckers finally get they shit right
Ain't no fight, they scared shitless, all they do is grab the mic
Ain't no organizing real shit on the street, it's a fleet
Of revolutionaries in the studio making beats
So fuck the fame, fuck the game, fuck the riches foo'
I ain't got shit unless all my folks gon' have theirs too
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
But a name don't mean wealth
Let me up you on this shit
If we was up in this, just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves

I'm looking for that lonely street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called lonely street?
Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

Fucking with the realest
Best decisions in my business was to get up off of Def Jam

Feeling like the ones who you around, they don't really want you winnin', that's the way that it appear
Fuck it I'm on one
I been turning hit's into a home run
Add figures into the income, never really worry 'bout the outcome
Look me in my eyes, you can tell the type of guy that I am where I come from
Claim you a Soulja Boy, too I run up on ya now you going to play dumb, dumb
All you niggas suck like my bitches
Disrespect from all of my intentions
You can lose your starter any minute
Before you ever start know I can finish, beast boy
You niggas disfigured in a decoy
Breaking up the bands like a devoice
For every nigga biting on the flow, watch her show up to their shows with a motherfucking invoice
I'm a king, you a peasant
Better know you livin' with a legend
I just treat the beat like a voice mail so I hope you got the message
You are now tuned to the bad guy
Never was I looking for a handout
People wanna talk about myself but brag about the latest things on the Carter like
Nigga I had tripping on the wrist watch
Most of y'all still rocking G Shocks
I just know you mentioning my name
I'm the one who run the game
I can do this shit in flip flops

A year or two and you gon' be irreverent

"I've been hanging out with the rejects in the attic
Can't get out of my head the way you left
I've got a sense of belonging but what does it matter
And winter's on its way here to collect
I was born on the outskirts of a dream
My daddy was a miner of almost everything
I've been busting stones
Too proud to go back home
Admit that all my digging was in vain
But don't we talk different than we did
Am I more quiet than I've been
Don't you look brighter than the moon
Don't I look different without you
Don't I look different without you
I'm taking rain like an appaloosa hoofprint
And you know I'm drinking sunlight all day long
I'm opened up just like a dogwood flower
And winter's on its way here to collect
But don't we talk different than we did
Am I more quiet than I've been
Don't you look brighter than the moon
Don't I look different without you
Don't I look different without you
I was taken on the outskirts of a dream
I have been a miner of almost anything
Now I'll stop busting stones
I have to go back home
Admit that all my digging was in vain
But don't we talk different than we did
Am I more quiet than I've been
Don't you look brighter than the moon
Don't I look different without you

"Joanie was the girl who lived next door
I've known her I guess ten years or more
Joanie wrote me a note one day
And this is what she had to say.......
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love forever true
Slowly I read her note once more
I went over to the house next door
Her teardrops fell like rain that day
When I told Joanie what I had to say
Joanie, Joanie please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
You're just 15 and I'm 22
And Joanie I just can't wait for you
Soon I left our little home town
Got me a job and tried to settle down
But these words kept haunting my memory
The words that Joanie said to me
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love forever true
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane
I had to see Joanie
I had to explain
How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joanie if she'd marry me
I ran all the way to the house next door
But things weren't like they were before
My teardrops fell like rain that day
When I heard what Joanie had to say
Jimmy, Jimmy please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by

"With intend to die I move onto the roof
I await this fall bringing peace after all
I will cross the border, set my life out of order
Dissatisfied from the superficial frame of mind
A magical attraction disperses fear of height
In sudden ecstasy gravity embraces me
Shadows cross my mind, my inner eyes are blind
Now I try to cry, laughing while I fly
Avalanches of incredible presentiments
Break walls where I left all reason behind
I am like a bird flying south in winter
But for me it is never to return
I will stop brooding, no remorse at all
Finally time for self deception is past
I enjoy this marvelous trip of my body
My spirit flies to an unknown destiny
In the air suspended I look at what's below
Deadly frightened eyes staring into mine
If there is an entry to a new dimension
Can I make any move or am I just a toy?
Was it intention or who threw the dice?
All I really getting to the bottom of life?
After day will be night, after dark shall be light
Who says that those axioms will ever be right?
Can you tell me where's the place of conception?
Can you tell me where's the place of death?
Who decides what, who, how we will be?
Is there anywhere an ultimate goodbye?
I lift my face, seize the expanse of the sky
Welcome to this journey, destination's free
For a moment it seems I could fly forever
But now I feel how the impact broke my spine
I am like a bird flying south in winter
But for me it is never to return
If there is an entry to a new dimension
Can I make any move of am I just a toy?
Was it intention or who threw the dice?
Am I really getting to the bottom of life?
After day will be night, after dark shall be light
Who says that those axioms will ever be right?
Can you tell me where's the place of conception?
Can you tell me where's the place of death?
Who decides what, who, how we will be?
Is there anywhere an ultimate goodbye?
Can you tell me how to get to heaven?
Can you tell me how to get to hell?

So let's do it one more time

To where my records are

Take the open road

First thing when I get home

It's eating me up inside
Inside I've slipped away
I know it's getting closer
I feel I'm almost there
Still one more time can't hurt me
But I won't shed a tear
Grab the keys
Start the car
Take me home
To where my records are
Hit the gas
Take the open road

First thing when I get home
The time has come
Been waiting for so long
It's written on my face
My face has turned to stone
Not asking for your sympathy
I just want out of here
So scratch the day off the month
And say the coast is clear
Grab the keys
Start the car
Take me home
To where my records are

Take the open road

In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen

But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies

When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy

Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets

"Soft as the voice of an angel whispers our comforting way
You know all entertainers get mail from their fans
And sometimes folks even write to us for advice
For example; I got a letter not long ago
From man that worked in a factory
The factory had been forced to close down
And sadly the young man had lost his job
He'd been out of work for about a year
When his wife gave up, took their three kids and left him
He'd been looking for work all this time
And now he's facing the situation all alone
He says that sometimes the depression takes over
And he doesn't know how he'll find the strength to go on
Well, I'm not a professional counselor and certainly not a philosopher
I am a country singer, but I do know from experience
That sometimes there is only one thing that will keep your heart from breaking
And that's what I'd like to offer to this young man
Some words of wisdom from a great old hymn
They call me Whispering Bill
Well today what I want to whisper is hope
Whispering hope oh how welcome thy voice
I got another letter from a single mom
Telling me she and her two children are just barely getting by
The child support payments come late and sometimes they don't come at all
The cost of sending the kids to school is growing every day
She is working two jobs just to make ends meet
She says sometimes there is just no light at the end of the tunnel, only darkness
And sometimes she feels like ending it all
I just hope she will remember these words
Wait 'till the darkness is over wait 'till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow after the shower is gone
No matter how dark and how turbulent things may seem
The darkness will turn to light and the storm will calm
I hope these folks are listening as I whisper these words of hope
Not just for them but for any one
Who finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation
It may be the homeless, the sick, the broken family
The business man even the leaders of our country
Anybody can be overcome by sorrow and desperation
And while I am just one man with one voice
I can lift it up in a hopeful message
That wherever there is life there is hope
Whispering hope oh, how welcome Thy voice
Bathing my heart in it's sorrow rejoice Whispering Hope",Country

Don't say a world about trust
I don't want to know
With your lies you shut yourself out
of the room of hope
You filled my life with pain
I take care of your death
I will kill you two times
And you will never find rest
First I kill your soul
Then I suck your blood out
Your body will serve me
You'll keep my dreams alive
You don't know these eyes staring at you right now
You feel my hate and your fear reflects on my insane mind
My revenge feeds my demon inside
His power comes from the deep cold night",Metal
"Verse 1: Watching from a far,
wondering if you will take me back,
and I'm really sorry for all the tears I caused
those times I turned my back.
I made a mistake before,
it wont happen again, as long as your with me
I'm down on my knee's looking in your eye's,
praying you'll forgive me.
Chorus: So here I am,
with nothing to give but an old broken heart.
It's here I'll stand,
with nothing to gain & nothing to lose
but you.
Verse 2: It's funny how time drag's,
when your not around
when your not with me,
and in my house there's not a sound
'cause im crying on my bed.
mistake's in the past
dont let them last,
it's time to put them to rest now.
Time has shown me that I was wrong,
I hope you'll love me again.

Shoe me a light, show me my god
Searching for the ultimate reality
Looking for the father the deity
Knowing I am the giver of all life
Asking where is the one that gave me mine
Searching for the ultimate reality
Looking for the father the deity
Knowing I am the giver of all life
Asking where is the one that gave me mine

Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it

And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control
Of the person that I thought I was, the boy I used to know
There is a light in the dark and I feel its warmth
In my hands, in my heart, why can't I hold on?
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watched as our young hearts fade into the flood, into the flood
Freedom, falling, the feeling that I thought was set in stone
Slip through my fingers, trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
It carries us away
Though the wind, down to the place
We used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in silence, like I lost in space
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watched as our young hearts fade into the flood, into the flood
Freedom, falling, the feeling that I thought was set in stone
Slip through my fingers, trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
It carries us away
I watched my world view disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find
It comes and goes in waves

Slip through my fingers, trying hard to let go

So I could really laugh and say I'm better off alone

You're always giving me away you cry baby heart

And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do 
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh but I remember something you once told me

The path of revenge
There's no way to stop and the more I try to hurt you
The more it hurts me

Though I have all the means of bringing you fuckers down
I can't make myself
To destroy upon command
Somehow forgiveness lets the evil make the laws

Yet what if naught exists above?
No shining glory and no god

Kneel before your god yet do not see

With paws ov truth
With slashing jaws I rape

"From the thoughts that I've been thinkin'
I should think of an alibi
Though I'm innocent, I've still got a guilty mind
There's no place that I can turn to
When she turns out the lights
To keep her from seein' you burnin' in my eyes
It's like tryin' to hide a fire in the dark
Carryin' around this torch in my heart
I cannot conceal it, I cannot put it out
It's like tryin' to hide a fire in the dark
Tryin' to fight a flame I never meant to start
It's out of control and nothin' can help me now
At first it was no problem
Flickering thoughts of you now and then
Nothin' intimate that she could call a sin
Then you sparked my imagination
Temptation 'bout to drive me wild
These flares of desire you can see for miles
It's like tryin' to hide a fire in the dark
Carryin' around this torch in my heart
I cannot conceal it, I cannot put it out
It's like tryin' to hide a fire in the dark
Tryin' to fight a flame I never meant to start
It's out of control and nothin' can help me now",Country

When autumn first arrived you were my lady
And love was written in the winter snow
Then with the change of months there came october
And now I wonder where that love did go
It was the second rain of autumn we shared a feeling
It was such, such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was
But like kids we were too shy to say to each other 
That together we would always like to be
Someday soon I know we'll come together
Even though our feelings change as seasons do
But maybe sweet november will tell us the story
That will bring us back the love that we both knew
When autumn first arrived you said you'd be my lady
And promised me that you would never go
Then with the change of months then came october
And now I'm wondering where, where did our love go
It was the second rain of autumn we shared a feeling

You can tell by my revelations
That I don't know who I am
All I need is an explanation
And I'm sure I'll understand
Love is made like grains of sand
Moving in the tide
Love is worn as memories
You seem to keep inside
Where is love and happiness?
C'mon show me the way
Where is love and happiness?
C'mon show me the way
C'mon...
I can build on my exaltations
But alone I'll never win
You can teach me how to smile,
And to alter all my sins
I will give you anything
I'll try hard to believe
I can learn to laugh again
Oh so eagerly
Where is love and happiness?
C'mon show me the way
Where is love and happiness?

"In nineteen hundred and eighty six
There's not much for a chippie but swinging a pick
And you can't live on love, on love alone
So you sail cross the ocean, away cross the foam
To where you're a Paddy, a Biddy or a Mick
Good for nothing but stacking a brick
Your best mate's a spade and he carries a hod
Two work horses heavily shod
Oh I'm missing you
I'd give all for the price of a flight
Oh I'm missing you
Under Piccadilly's neon
Who did you murder, are you a spy?
I'm just fond of a drink helps me laugh, helps me cry
So I just drink red biddy for a permanent high
I laugh a lot less and I'll cry till I die
All ye young people now take my advice
Before crossing the ocean you'd better think twice
Cause you can't live without love, without love alone
The proof is round London in the nobody zone
Where the summer is fine, but the winter's a fridge
Wrapped up in old cardboard under Charing Cross Bridge
And I'll never go home now because of the shame
Of misfit's reflection in a shop window pane",Folk
"Why don't you want to talk to me does it feel easier to pass me by
you read my face like I'm a fucking disgrace and you never look me in the eyes
the truth is always easiest to ignore and that's why you walk the other way
but is it really that hard for you to think of something comforting to say
Don't look at me as If I'm different
Don't look at me as If I wasn't there
Don't look at me as If I'm no good
Don't look at me as If you didn't care,as if I wasn't there!
You walk a little faster like you're trying to say that you really haven't got the time
and when I put my hand out for a coin or two you just pretend that you've gone blind
It seems hard for you to show any compassion for me but it wouldn't hurt for you to try
reality can be painfull but tell me have you ever wondered why?
Don't look at me as If I'm different
Don't look at me as If I wasn't there
Don't look at me as If I'm no good
Don't look at me as If you didn't care,as if I wasn't there!
You like to keep a safe distance from me to make sure that we never meet and just in case I might be dangerous you quickly turn and walk across the street
You're so scared of the sight that you see that you decide to never understand
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am

I think you're gonna have to find who you are
Can't find your, lane but you wanna be a star
A star, do you wanna be a star?
Can't find your, lane but you wanna be, wanna be a star
I know the grind, she tryin' to be a star, she goin' hard
Doin' a hundred in the car but never could make it out the yard
Cause you're stalled, how, when you can't even get it started?
It's probably cause you too naughty to get up in the party
She wanna make it so she'll sleep with him, late night creep with him
He'll tell her he can make her famous if she did him
Suck him lick him, another victim of a ""bust and ditch 'em""
Why must you suffer this when really love, what's the mission?
Because you still live in your daddy and your momma house
Shoulda knew homie was not about to go the dumber route
Left you with a lot of doubt, kinda like in a drought
Got no mo' integrity, slow flow, what you tellin' me?
There's jealousy goin' on, all because she wanna make it famous
And sip champagne with the greatest
So you wanna be a star, the ride you'll take is evident
You'll never get ahead so it's irrelevant 

Baby girl can sing, she thick, man I think she got it
But they tellin' me to watch her, call her baby pockets
So I bring it to her straight, to a real knight
She got herself on protection, we all good all night
She said they only wanna cut, bustas never business
Sometimes she wishes but uh, maybe then they'll listen
Dirty game, I feel the same
And do I think her career woulda jumped if she just laid down
A tear in her eye, baby don't cry
And then she told me all about her church background
And how she lovin' this life, livin' this life
Now I think I'm dealin' with a headcase
Any heart put it all in, tell yo'self it's a must-win
Apply pressure never give up, laugh in the end then fuck 'em
Stay on yo' paper nigga straight face, attitude nigga pay me
Still wanna be a star, huh, huh? Reach hard!

Hear you wanna be a star, huh?
Think you got what it take to make it large, huh?
Don't even know who you are, huh?
You say you wanted to learn it, huh? You say everybody feelin' you
""Flesh I hear 'em"" what a wonderful tinglin' feel in you
How straight are your priorities? So the story goes
Chasin' dreams, all they tellin' them is sacrifice they souls
You really listenin'? Learn a lesson from these bro's
Playin' the game it's heavy heatin' up and down that road
They say the boy got talent but he can't catch a break
He doin' everything he can but he makin' mistakes
Plus he runnin' with the crowd cause he wanna be seen
Got the tendency to follow instead of takin' the lead
We in the league of extraordinary gentlemen check
And if you wanna play the game you got to give 'em the step
Make no impression with expression but you gotta be focused
They don't pick you for the team just because you the dopest
Too many niggas got the game twisted lookin' for fame
Instead of lovin' what they do, and makin' a name
It's a shame how they idolize the idiot box
Feel the pain in television, the deception and shock
And when they finally figure out it ain't about what they seein'
Take the money and the toys, niggas still human beings
All of that ain't jack if you ain't got the respect
Cause a real superstar know how to double them checks, yep

I see women givin' they bodies like David Letterman love you
Strugglin' in the hustle, slangin' tapes on the internet avenue
Get you capitol shit, know how the ratchet do
Sorry I was late to tell you exactly what masters do
You don't have to sell your soul, no not anymore
Parker Brothers, Ouija board, I covered that Adam whore
Niggas get their labels but wait, it's a recession in weight
You downloadin' on all the industry's veterans
Been a star but bein' a star don't pay the bills
Know 'bout the spinnin' wheels, baby Bizzy keep it real
Don't open battle seals, no matter who you are
Now get your money, only Jesus can make you a star

Oh, ooh, oh 
You wanna be, you wanna be 
You wanna be, oh, oh, oh 
You wanna be, wanna be 
Wanna be a star, star, star, star

Craziest thing that I ever heard
Testing cosmetics upon their fur
Who knows what tomorrow brings in a world where the
Greedy survive and survival of the fittest is your alibi?
It's a habit to grab it, to grab right here
Cause you might want my private for souvenir
And you call me a savage, uncivilized
When its you who made lynching a way of life
And you don't want me to be mad
Well I say to you too bad
I'm a product of my environment
So who the fuck we callin' wildlife
Look at us
They only kill when they have to we
We kill for sport
why do the man treat the people bad
And just expect them not to be mad
Social security sure you right
Number the ones with the broken lives
Who knows what tomorrow brings in a world where the
Greedy survive and survival of the fittest is your alibi?
It's a habit to grab it, to grab right here
Cause you might want my private for souvenir
And you call me a savage, uncivilized
When its you who made lynching a way of life
And you don't want me to be mad
Well I say to you too bad
I'm a product of my environment
So who the fuck we callin' wildlife
Look at us
They only kill when they have to we
We kill for sport",R&B
"Hey, Skee, tell 'em I'm goin' away for a while
mufucka's wanna see me dead
mufucka's wanna see me in tha feds
bitches wanna give me head
dollas in my bank account
Soundscan the first week out
mufucka's on my dick
mufucka's talkin' shit
hit a breakdown, I'm the king, and you better respect it
all i need is Beyonce,AND A Rockafella necklace
Nigga, you can check up on it I'm a slim thug Cincinatti fitted with the red and black rim, blood
gave niggas 300 bars, 2 mixtapes, and a DVD
I did it for the CPT
Did it for New York
Did it for Chi-town
ran through hip hop and made these nigga's lie down
I'm goin' away for a while, call it a California vacation
I call it a Bentley with a smile =)
God Bless the child with incredible style, nigga sicka than the West Nile
Who's king of the West now?
I'm puttin' my vest down, niggas ain't gonna kill shit
Shut the fuck up,nigga, you ain't gon' kill shit
Rappers don't kill rappers, guns kill rappers
And I be with real crips, real bloods, real clappers
fuck rappin', these niggas'll push ya grill backwards
fasta than Iraqi's when Bush attacked'em
My flow semi-automatic
Touch'n pussies is my job, you a bitch, this is sexual harrassment
nigga get a lawyer when The Game comin' for ya
My jab like zab on a chin of Da Lahoya
I'm tha golden boy, and I'm makin' Hova noise
got tha whole world clappin just like them Noya Boys
Since a juvenile, i had to prove my style
Went from Kay Slay to DJ Clue then blaw(
20 magizine covers,nigga look at me now
You need a hot 16? I need a hot hundred thou
'causez half of these rap niggas just be runnin' they mouth
The other half in the ATL runnin' the South
10 mil in the bank, 7 bedroom house, i'm rich, so on my 30th birthday, I'm out
Nigga, i'm so ahead'a time, and i spit betta lines, betta rhymes
Every time niggas hate on me so much, I feel like I'm Kevin Federline
""fuck it I'm rich, for nothin', tell the media, get off'a my dick
You with me? my next album gon' sell like Britney
I beat on these rap niggas like Bobby do Whitney
No more drama, no more beef wit 50
And if ya just tunin' in, welcome to the 360, welcome to the 360, welcome to the 360
Right back where I started, in Compton, takin' out the garbage
Where Crips and Bloods shoot it out like Pearl Harbor
That was '95, when Cube was in his prime
You bought ya Lethal Injection, and I bought mine
Rewind to '89, got my first mixtape
My brotha bought it for me, they used to call him Big Fa$e
But now, we ain't brothers, nigga, we ain't shit
And you livin' in my shadow like Marcus Vick
And I heard about ya little rappers talkin' shit
Stay out my family business or you get a coffin quick
I ain't changed, same Nigga that got off them bricks
Got signed to Dr. Dre because his bars are sick
Gettin' head on tha road 'cause his cars are sick
And he rymed so good I had to pause the shit
I tell her boomp, slow down baby, I gotta get this shit firm like Foxy, Nas, and AZ
She said fuck you pay me, so I left her in A.Z.
That's what i get for lettin' her listen to my Jay-Z
fuck a bitch, give me a 40, I'll take that
Dress up for the Grammys, but i still don't drive Maybachs
Nigga, I'm a gangsta, and homie don't play dat
Stand way back, and get your ass clapped ASAP
Nigga, this the payback
You want beef, say that
I'll have a hundred Hurricane hoodies where you lay at
Get ya whole click wet, makin' up Crip sets, nigga got ran outta New York by Dipset
Then he got ran outta Compton by my set
Banned from Watts, can't even walk through his projects
Nigga so lame, talkin' he gang bang
Won't bust a shot, and tha nigga know where i hang
I'm Big Daddy Kane in the platinum chain, the fact remains,The Game dont' rap for fame
Game rap for fun, Game blast his gun, 'n Game got a rappin' tongue, so that bastard's done
Be easy, I might give you a pass this once
I'm Ready To Die, but I don't wanna basterd son
Nigga, I rap too good, and I'm back in the hood
On the same couch I put my demo and the package for Suge
After one meeting I was right back in the hood
Red bandana hangin' sellin' crack in the hood
Now it's Aftermath for good
Any nigga mention Dre get a Desert Eagle shoved in his face
How that taste? Blow ya shit out fa real
Call Nelly or Paul Wall, tell 'em make you a grill
I cook beef like a steak on the grill
Got tha clips on hold, but I ain't pharrel
Nigga I'm for real , my flow ill like smoke in ya lungs
I spit sharp, like a razor blade under my tongue
Nigga, I'm number one, motha fucka
Bar none, who else kick knowledge outside'a Hoa''n the God Son
'N we can bar for bar, cocksucker, drop some
Watch me take flight like Tom Cruise in Top Gun
You might win some, but you just lost one
I beat on these lil' niggas like Doctor Dre's drums
Look at these mufucka's tryin'a prove theyselves
Thinkin' beefin' wit Hurricane gon' boost they sells
Never that, muthafucka, I'm a clever cat
Kanye West and slacks, nigga, I'm as fresh as that
Ask Dre, ask Snoop, I'm nice
I'm Cube, I'm Jacob, I put rapper's on ice
""Hey, Skee, let me ask you a question-If you take the 120 bars, put it with the 240 bars, then add a 360 bars, with one Kevin Federline, what do you get?  ""Let's get tha fuck outta here, man, let's go find somethin' to do.",Hip-Hop
"It's a frantic situation, it's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, it's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, it's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
Extra salty 'cuz whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snappin', my God tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on, I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggaz was over my crib gettin' smoked out
No tellin' who had the place scoped out
Donnie brought over some niggaz I didn't know
I'm askin', who are you? They said, I'm with the Mo
If it was them, soon I will collide with them
And they better not be rockin', no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car, he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
To have the set of keys but that I wasn't tryin' to believe
But I could have put it past him
Or those other bastards
It would be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
'Cuz whoever did ain't gon admit it
The blunted dirty dishes is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind
It might surface 'cuz tellin' Allah, Joe is worthless, uh
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are

"You said you'd win me over
I said you never would
You said you'd wear me down, well,
Never thought you could
So how did you make me love you?
You're not even my type
You tore down my defences
Against my best advice

 Now you tell you you're leaving
Now you tell me you can't go on
Now you tell me you're leaving
Now you tell me
Now you tell me
I'd built my walls around me
Out of common sense
My natural inclinations
Were my best defence
I thought my heart was safe 'cause
I kept it out of your sight
So how did you steal it from me?
Have I no legal rights?

I wish I'd never lost my head
I wish I'd stuck to what I said
It wouldn't be me here cryin' now
I suppose I've made my bed
And about those tears I shed
It shouldn't be me here cryin'
It shouldn't be me here cryin'

"In this maze where can I sleep, I've seen the light and then again
Journey after journey hatred followed, unleashed upon the final ride
Release me from these god forsaken claws, please let me die
These walls have known me before, they're creeping up on me
With the firmest grip of senses, I freeze eternally
Release me from these god forsaken claws, please let me die
I CAN'T FEEL MY BONES, THE BLOOD HAS ALL DRIED UP
I AM CAUGHT IN-BETWEEN
I CAN'T FEEL MY BONES, THE BLOOD HAS ALL DRIED UP
I?M NOT EVEN DEAD
Torture is hiding me from them, silence is grasping for my mind
The paths and stones are desolate now, is this where I can finally rest
Release me from these god forsaken claws, please let me die

Your tears become laughter
I will catch them and turn them back again

You made a plan
You think you're in control

Check around the corner
Because it's coming
Here's your wakeup call

I will shake you
I will make your shattered dreams unwind
Because it's only when it comes to pieces
Only then this time increases
You will find the piece that you've been dying for
You'll realize that all this time
You've been pushing on a pull door
You've been pushing on a pull door
Upside down, then you see it all

"Monkeys dancing on a hot tin tray
A jaded palette with a fat lip
I think that we went thataway
We've given ourselves the slip
Taking it down yet another peg
Tightening our belts and girding our loins
So let's make an omelet of golden eggs
And you can toss some coins
Here's half a chance I must be off
Perhaps I should have gone some time ago
A long time ago and far away
I had a dream and still some pride
Along the way my head was turned
When the trickle became a tide
Monkeys dancing on a hot tin tray
A jaded palette with a fat lip
I think that we went thataway
We've given ourselves the slip
Taking it down yet another peg
Tightening our belts and girding our loins
So let's make an omelet of golden eggs
And you can toss some coins
I thought, I deserved a little treat
You should see the looks that I get driving this
It's not like me but I'm lost for words
I know I've deceived you endlessly
I tell everyone that we're good friends
But the truth is plain for you and me
Monkeys dancing on a hot tin tray
A jaded palette with a fat lip
I think that we went thataway
We've given ourselves the slip
Taking it down yet another peg
Tightening our belts and girding our loins
So let's make an towelette of golden eggs
And you can toss some coins
So this is over get the plot?
I cannot give what I haven't got
I've got in touch with the inner me

Unhappy and should get shot of you

"Yeah, yeah
Me and my man Com Sense
Rallying troops like Joseph Stalin
Where you at, yo?
I'm about to make the name Com Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him
I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't ""F"" with me
Stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who want to battle?
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What
""Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron""
""I ain't scared of no nigga""
I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper whose career
You could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble it's
Mistaken as a weakness, when poetry's in motion
Like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions
""Fucking with Canibus""
Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal was given, MCs get bitten with venom
From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the Shroud of Turin
For certain, I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this
The lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as
You gay ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source chilling on page 40
Put this in your CD-ROM
WWW dot Canibus dot com
You can find me on the internet talking to chicks
That was sweating me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talking mad trash, trying to get them to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beast from the East part 2, coming to see you
It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
Since I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared

In Pandemonium the rebellious counsel aligned.
As the great dragon arrives from beyond the magical abyss,
the eleven-pointed star rises for the sake... Samael speads his wings with enchantment.
In front Lucifer stands... with burning passion and a stare in his sad, tortured eyes...
As a gracefallen glare, uncertain of what lies ahead he turns to the daughter of Lilith.
Namaah:
For the sake of Apep - for the death of Ra...
For the glory of thine future - for the death of God.
Thou art the leader as night our saviour...
On the edge of Heav'n His false love shall die!
Lucifer:
I want to look down when He's screaming,
when the dark night opens to Kliffoth.
Lilith sings with chanting echoes...
I now enter to awake the red beast.
Samael:
The signs are calling to us all...
Soon it's time to fight the battle!
Tail now winding... Cauda Draconis!
Astaroth:
O fallen friends, we raise an eternal night.
We shall never worship His humans ...
The dragon has lifted our minds... 
Our soul has burn'd by dragonfire,
purified from all holy matters.
The flames are infernal...
Lucifer:
... and Naamah shall guide us!
Cauda Draconis!
Apep:
My fire shall burn to light thy way,
Fallen stars, soon you'll storm the heav'ns,
and the grace o' Lilith weakens the seed of Adam
for the sake of Thee, Seraphim Rebellious!
Lucifer:
Oh, demon might...... Oh, dragon soul.
Moons once lost I see in darkness supreme.
Samael:
Oh, nocturnal queen, your evil eye's I have seen.
I've awakened thee... in Lilith...... Cauda Draconis!
And myriads of angels... dragons and demons alike
flew like a dream out from the lovelorn darklands...
and with flaming swords they raged towads the vaults of Heaven.
The second rebellion of Lucifer has begun...

"A passing ship
I have found the open ocean
Give me no lip
The waves roll by as I pass on
A sunlit sea
On the first day of April
How fresh the wind
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
How many words
How many songs still unwritten?
How many ships
Of the line have come and gone?
In the good old days
May they never be forgotten
They had heavy wind
Or they had no wind at all
A passing ship
It is midnight on the ocean
Had a real long trip
I have been at sea all winter
When my ship came in
I was givin' up the ghost
I think I should be
Leavin' those passing ships alone
When the sea runs high
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady
And I think of you
In the warmth of your home and family
When love is true
There is no truer occupation
And may this gale
Blow us to the ones we love
Another day, another ocean
Give me no lip
But stand aside as I pass on
A sunlit sea
On the last day in October
How fresh the wind
Will you miss me from now on?
I guess I should be
Leavin' passing ships alone",Folk

neither its sadness nor its activity
nor its best-seller flowers

We used to say that our love was like hemp rope
three times as strong as the rope that you buy domesticly
we would bond in the face of oppression from big business
and the Deans
But I knew there was a problem
every time the group would meet
everyone would light up
It made it difficult to discuss glaucoma and human rights,
not to mention chemotherapy
Well, sometimes life gives us lessons
sent in ridiculous packaging
So I found him in the arms of a ""student
against the treacherous use of fur""
And he gave no apology
He just turned to me stoned out to the edge of oblivion
He didn't pull up the sheets and I think he even smiled
as the said to me: 
-Well, I guess our dreams went up in smoke.....Huhuh
-and I said:
-No, our dreams went up in dreams....you stupid pot-head
And another thing
What kind of a name is ""students
against the treacherous use of fur""
Fur is already dead and besides
a name like that doesn't make a good acronym
I am older now
I know the rise and gradual fall of a daily victory
And I still write to my Senators saying they should
legalize cannabis and I should know
'Cause I am a horticulturist
I have a husband and two children out in Lexington, Mass.
And my ex-boyfriend can't tell me I've sold out
Because he's in a cult
and he's not allowed to talk to me.....",Indie
"Father you stand in the ancient gates
Ready to make great flight
Hell is in the roaring abyss
Somewhere behind it
There's a new world
Soon it will belong only to you
Falling to rise is to be written
Blessed in blasphemy
For the truth is in it
Bible will burn in the hands of traitors
Behind the limit of self-preservation
Hear revelations accept
The creator or die
But for someone it's too late
Regretting that the man was born
Look at the dead man at the world extinct
Conscious essence of your savior
Vomit on atheism
At the gates of being
Of eternal suffering",Metal

I sold my soul, you bought it back for me

You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I can almost see eternity

And I can't believe it's you, I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool
Cause I've finally found someone who really cares
You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again

For everything that's lovely is but a brief, dreamy, kind delight

Have given their hearts up to the play
And who could play it well enough

In the poverty's sigh.

Of demons and hell's fire.
Warnings of the devil's decree
In all sinful desires.
A boy have just arrived,
An orphan he's become
From adultery and incest and witchery.
To the seething alleys
Of quarrels and discord,
A storm cloud has finally gathered.
Discussions long into the night,
About the dark one's diabolical scheme.
Children they listen and they dream
Well-fed nightmares of a similar theme.
Imaginations out of control.
For each morning they tell more and more.

Rode on the goat astride.

There is the torture witch,
Poked us with glowing sticks.
God save us from Satan's allies!

Confess your sins to our Christ!
I can't confess to what children dream.
Prejudiced tongues has twisted
Their minds before your eyes.
Silence, you whore of the dark one,
Save your soul and repent what you've done!
Accuse the poor
And get a tap on the head.
You truly are a blessed child,
She will burn in iron upon the stake.
Accuse the countess
And get a slap into the face.

Chanting the praise
Ever higher.

The witches ways.

From indolence it sprung.

There is the fiendish flock,
All limbs are chained and locked.

Ending his fancied game.

Your friends talk bad about me bitch, you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up, you down they got nothin' to say
But when you call, I'll come runnin', I'll always take the pain away
They set you up, to let you down, they crowned you prom queen
Fiddle about me behind your back, they call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone, so I can kiss and hug you
Plus me beside you, no other man can loves you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I found pleasure in pleasin' you, like a real man should
It was written long before, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand, when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

Per Tyrsson's daughters in Vnge
Oh how chilly their woods
They were fast asleep a long time ago
Whilst the woods burst into leaf
The youngest was the first one to awake
She soon awoke the others
They sat themselves down upon their beds
and plaited the hair on each other's heads
Then they dressed in clothes of silk
and made their way to church
When they came to Vnga hill
they met three robbers who held them still
""Pray, would you care to become robbers' wives?
Or would you rather lose your lives?""
""We would not care to become robbers' wives.
We would much rather lose our lives.""
They chopped their heads off on birch-wood stem
and soon three wells sprung forth by them
The bodies were dug down in muddy ground,
the clothes they carried to Vnga town.
As they arrived in Vnga farm
Fru Karin came to greet them.
""Say, would you care to buy clothes of silk
that nine maidens have knitted and crotcheted?""
""Open your bundles and let me see
maybe I know them, all three.""
Fru Karin quivers as never before
and runs to Per Tyrsson who stands by the door
""There are three robbers outside our farm
they've gotten rid of our daughters""
Per Tyrsson grabs his sword and then
he runs to slay the two older men.
He asked the third one before he stroke
""Who is your father and mother?""
""Our father Per Tyrsson in Vnge,
our mother Fru Karin in Skrnge.""
Per Tyrsson went to the smithy
and forged himself iron round his waist.
""What shall our retribution be?""
""We'll build a church out of stone and lime.""
""Krna Church shall be its name""
Oh how chilly their woods
""Oh, how willingly we will build it .""
Whilst the woods burst into leaf

"No they won't miss you when you're gone
When your heart stops beating and pumping blood
Pull the pin, light the fuse

You make your own choices and decisions
You are invulnerable to influences

An electrifying organized crime
With planes and boats and suicide
Sit down, line up, knuckle down, shut up
You're so in control
You're so disposable

Memory erased, magnet over tape
Sit down, line up, knuckle down, shut up
Get psyched up listen to Godsmack
Dip you toes in the sands of Iraq

Mystical, the smell of fear, fire breeds the pain inside me

Come with me, catastrophy, lead me to reality",Metal
"O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

Got to bed half past five
Can't remember Saturday or Sunday
Life is grand
Doesn't it feel good to be alive
When you're going somewhere
Going somewhere
Paint the food through bricks and mortar
Bide my time trying to have some fun
Half past ten I drink a little water
Time stands still
I'm seeing my future slip through my hands
Watch the wind whip through desert sand
Then I remember I'm no ordinary man
And I'm going somewhere
Going somewhere
It's been years since I was a builder
Working with my head and hands
Dreams of crystal, glass and silver
Gold flashing past
So tantalizing, the things that I've seen
I know you know exactly what I mean
Can't ever look back to where you've been
When you're going somewhere
Going somewhere
Clock strikes eight up on a Monday
Got to bed half past five

Shinin' those fancy things, but its not what he's made out of...
He takes good care of me and loves me when i'm down
He's my best friend to me and damn he makes me proud

So now I'm feelin like I'm choked up...

I tried to settle some things, but now that games done
I see your face red, you're gettin wasted
You play with fire, it'll get you like you're K-Fed
We on the record baby, you got a second maybe
and ya'll know who I am, sorry Chelsea Lately...
Let's teach it as a lesson, man you fall from Heaven
This redemption is the only thing my mind's stressin.

And I'm fallin for him, I'm fallin in love
I never thought I'd fall in love, I never thought I'd fall in...
And I'm fallin for him, I'm fallin in love
I never thought I'd fall in love, I never thought I'd fall in...
When life is hard on him he wants me by his side
When I lie next to him he holds me thru the night
I'll build a life for him, I'll keep him safe and warm
When he comes home to me I'll be right at the door.

And now im knocking at your door miss
Open up, looking gorgeous, fly from head to toe
She smiles, a metamopheous...
Sunshine shines the clouds can run their course when we set sail everything is in orbit
Fight but never forfit, who knows you best
Lets take an overseas trip on my private jet
And like that, we reconnect, eyes to spirit
Im falling deep for your love, and I dont care who hear it

And I'm fallin for him, I'm fallin in love
I never thought I'd fall in love, I never thought I'd fall in
And I'm fallin for him, I'm fallin in love
I never thought I'd fall in love, I never thought I'd fall in
Baby you don't know how much I need you
You know I would give up everything to be with you
Got me crazy, wanna break you off

I'll never fall in love again

I'll lock my doors, click click click bang bang

When I'm walking down the street
Don't make me meet your sister, Pete
When there's a knock knockin' at my door
I'll just sit here on the floor
I'll run 26 miles a day straight up hills
Work overtime to pay all of my hospital bills
I'll spray black spray paint on my windowsills
I'll make a million dollars leave you outta my will

She'd prefer the blue
How I crave the liquor of her song
Poor bird who has done no harm
What harm could she do
She shall be my prisoner her life long
My songbird wants her freedom
Now don't you think I know
But I can't find it in myself
To let my songbird go
I just can't let her go

Peers into my soul

Take me lord and purify

your love was never wasted on me
I know you like the river darkly
you looked right like a stranger to me
Who is to utter light to utter darkness
who'll meet everyday my shadow in the same place

down down by the banks of your bones

Girl, you know I warned you.
Summer's coming soon.
If your gonna make a move, you better make your move.
Cus you know that in a week or two,
I'll be miles away from you
On the California coast.
But you know the thing I'll miss the most is you.
Girl, do you remember the time I held both your hands in mine
And we watched the stars come out that night?
You said your heart could hardly take
The moon's reflection on the glossy lake.
And I just whispered I love you.
Because you know that in a week or two,
I'll be miles away from you
On the California coast.
But you know the thing I miss the most is
If you miss me so much
That you can barely stand it
And your heart can hardly take it
You know I'm never more than a phone call away.
I won't hesitate to answer my phone
When your name shows up on my caller ID.
But you know I can't stay
Because summer is calling me.

"You tell me you're beaten, in search of a way
To know when to leave and to know when to stay
Here, people accept all the smart lies, confined
Forget all that nonsense, let's leave it behind

I saw it and I see it, keeps getting closer yet
This Freedom Landscape fades, oh
To hold it, don't mold it, just place it on your heart
This Freedom Landscape fades
This is my tribute to you my dear one
Do you feel your skin burn while you pray to the sun
I know there's a reason we scream on the phone
I'd rather stand off than to stand here alone


Some houses feel warm, oh so good, I can see
What's looming ahead in the future for me
And hands make great comfort but will they be here
When I'm reaching, waiting, as trouble comes near
I will wait and if you give a sign
I'll hold on until the end of time

"'Twas down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I.
When armed line of marching men
In squadrons passed me by.
No pipes did hum, no battle drum
Did sound its loud tattoo
But the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey's swell
Rang out in the foggy dew.
Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through;
While Brittania's huns with their great big guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.
'Twas England bade our wild geese go
That small nations might be free.
But their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves
On the fringe of the gray North Sea.
But had they died by Pearse's side
Or fought with Cathal Brugha,
Their names we'd keep where the Fenians sleep
'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew.
The bravest fell, and the solemn bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Watertide
In the springing of the year.
And the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men, but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew.",Folk

Ten bottles, teb bitches, go with my persona
Pull up in that Enzo then I do donuts

That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something
She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something
Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something

If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry
You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted
Do what you wanna do, drug test on you

Big mills, big deals 'bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bass line
She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time
Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed and we good

High of something, high of something
'til your mothafucking brain don't function
High of something, high of something
Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape
Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded
X-rated that's what I like glad that you made it
To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and
May I, kick a little something for G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

I envisioned it to be dark, wet, and cold. if he jumped, or if he fell, no one knows. but I've got a different picture for each one of those.

"Fear him, as soon as you hear him
Upon my arrival, the dope dealers cheer him
Just like a revival, the verse tends to steer 'em
Through a life in the fast lane, like German engineer em
No serum can cure all the pain I've endured
From crack to rap to back to sellin it pure
For every record I potentially sell in the store
It's like Mecca to the dealer that's sellin it raw
So many deceive ya
I'm on top with the ki's, move over Alicia
I force feed ya the metric scale
Rap's like child's play, my show and tell
Within each verse you see the truth's unveiled
They manufacture proof as they lie to themselves
Puppets on the string like a yoyo
Bouncin like a pogo, they prayin I never go solo
Got it for cheap
The wall's removed and now I see
My leg was pulled, the joke's on me
So heartbreakin, like lovin a whore
Might hurt ya once, but never no more
It's like tryin to fly but they clippin your wings
And that's exactly why the caged bird sings
Who can nickname it, the shame rings true
Seems to me reparations are overdue
I done been to the top, I done sipped the juice
And with that bein said, bird crumbs'll never do
Even on my last not a penny in the bank
I'ma stand on my own, so thanks but no thanks
Keep the pranks as I bid farewell
I gotta answer to Marcus and Jennel
And to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so
If ever I had millions never would you sell blow, never
Got it for cheap
I'm the best since he died, and he lied
The spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad

Pullin the covers back, I expose what you disguise
My presence is felt, the pressure is on
A four eleven Cuban helped us weather the storm
Pyrex and powder, it was back to the norm
Through all the adversity the fury was born
Niggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture
Even at your mama's she'll tell you that blood's thicker
And I don't know how them other niggas built
And I don't know if ever they feel guilt
Or maybe niggaz just too high on they stilts

Yo once again it's the big l, that kid who got much props
From killin corrupt cops, with motherfuckin buck shots
So don't step to this, cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big but they make coffins yo' size too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't cali, it's harlem nigga we do walkbys
No one can match me, tax me or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps g just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your lp cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin, that's idiotic
Cause if big l got the aids every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six g's
And I put more holes in his ass than swiss cheese

Or i'ma have your family dressed in all black

I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone chief
Or catch a buck shot to your domepiece
I must warn, I got it goin on, word is bond

I'm catchin bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers, not just on niggaz but hoes too
So don't try to test me, cause I can't stand test-es

Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal

And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin motherfuckers on the daily news
I was a gangsta from the git-go
Leavin fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe

Yo ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch aids, then i'ma start rapin bitches
I'm all about makin papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like norman bates did
My old man in the past, stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty g's is what the creep stole; so the next day
Knocked on his door and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style I'm wild, comin straight out of harlem pal
It's big l, the motherfuckin problem child

Ooooh, I got a freak on the way
She wants to come I'mma make her stay
Wheee! Cause the girl love's to geeee
Especially when it comes to Cleeeee
And when I bust a nut I'll say whee, hee-hee
Um, yeah, Smooth's havin fun cause he's got his flow on
Call me a freak jack-in-the-box, yeah I'll go on
A tight skirt and a tail makin crazy mail
In living colour, gumbo from my mother
Roller coaster, toast, jam
Martin Lawrence skins when I slam
Spill a fat drink like a gobstopper
When you see me in a club you know I'll holla
In comes three times when I nut
Put my dick in her butt, walked on her cunt
I sneeze, made her jump, let me tell it
Put my finger in her ass, let her smell it
Close the door, pretend I'm takin a shit
But I really got my toes pointed, hand on my dick
I'm sick, I got the flu
But I'll still kiss you till you smell like
Doodoo! My ass is soggy
My drawers are wet, they're kinda foggy
I can't see a thing, I feel like a big fat
Bing! Bong! Ding! Dong!
I got camel humps on my back
I got bald head butt corduroy calluses all on my hand
I smell like, uh, the Bee Gees band
Damn, that shit was wack!
I'm snugglin in the arms of a fresh stunt
Bosoms in my grill, peepin Benny Hill with a fat blunt
John Madden Football, a fat hit off the beadie
Doggystyle behind the bed and still can see the TV
Silly cartoons is getting watched
Like Juju  I think I see the blootch
BOOM! My mistake, it was 'de boom'
Bust in on my man in the next room
Wheee! Fuck you, Johnny
The spoon-fed Apple Jacks in bed room
Fresh freak with the ice cubes and a lot of headroom
A dope ho strip show with all the girls we know
I won't kiss the feet if the girlie's got cheese toes
Clee won't leave me alone, I'm five gees, gone
Wheee, Cleee...",Hip-Hop

Not so much as a kiss goodbye

They will go unspoken always

You will know everything there is to know
You're gonna know you're gonna know

Overcome the sloth, got me a ride to New York

How far will you go
Been living a lie with your Hollywood life
To take your disease to the highest high
But how much further can you go

Last night I dreamed that I was a child
Out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest
Before the darkness falls
I heard the wind rustling through the trees
And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
With the devil snappin' at my heels
I broke through the trees, and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story, and who I'd come for
She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore""
My father's house shines hard and bright
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling, so cold and alone
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned",Country

Me not afraid threat cause I'm forever fearless
And when time they want my life hanging by a thread
Me nah let them face me cause I'm forever blessed

Or rather crucify me when my back's against the wall
Good over evil that's why I conquer over all
My feet cemented in the ground that's why I stand tall

Nothing can bother me, no no

Grab hold of every moment like you're never gonna get that moment back
Fear, don't have none of that
Swear, son I love the fact
They do and they hope you fall but like the NFL they're running back
Sometimes it seems like chasing my dreams had me running laps
But look at me now, I flow like water from a running tap

You'll never ever have to feel like you're all on your own
Any time you're feeling scared, let this song be what you play
Look yourself in the mirror and this is what you're gonna say...

"I don't need a lot, I'm a simple man, a simple man,
and all I am is what you see,
and there's no secrets hidden in my walls.
All I did was believe, that love can save us all,
and some will rise and others fall,
but, if we all stand tall,
Love will save us all,
It'll save us all.
It's hard to give yourself, when there's not much there for you to share.
and maybe you've been hurt before.
You're not alone, you're not the only one that finds that pain hard to ignore.
Families fall apart, and one more ends and other starts.
but if we do our part, love could save our hearts,
could save us all, 
Save us All. ",Indie

And then you
Broke apart the lies
You told me I had
Something beautiful inside
You brought to life
The part of me
I thought had died
Cause you stood right there
Until I saw me
I saw me
Through your eyes
Saw me
I saw me
Through your eyes 
So, this is living
This is free
Not keeping score
Not anymore
Not since you rescued me
You lifted my head up
I was keeping my head down
I didn't know love
But I do now

Cause you stood right there
And then you
Broke apart the lies
You told me I had
Something beautiful inside
You brought to life
The part of me
I thought had died
Cause you stood right there
Until I saw me
I saw me
Through your eyes
Saw me
I saw me
Through your eyes 
You love me even when
I fall apart
I can't explain it
That's just who you are
Don't want perfection
You just want my heart

Cause you stood right there
And then you
Broke apart the lies
You told me I had
Something beautiful inside
You brought to life
The part of me
I thought had died
Cause you stood right there
Until I saw me
I saw me
Through your eyes

I saw me

"Take these trembling hands,
Touch these fingertips.
Help them understand,
The silence on your lips.
When the steam rises from the ground,
Levitating without a sound.
There's a peacefulness to be found,
In a breath that is skywards bound.
Soothe this pain, soothe this pain.
Mend this broken voice,
Ease these eager needs.
Every little choice,
Leads to fetile deeds.
Light up when the night is worn.
Opens up to an untouched morn.

Rest, when these worried eyes,
Melt away into open skies

Touch these fingertips.
Help them understand,

Run an electric shock to my brain

Of things real and things I've dreamt
Holding hearts in balance it is like
Maybe we were once intertwined
Raising souls up to the moon as we
Rise again,
Maybe then we will meet
Only tides are racing through your mind
Make a wish and then goodbye
Charlatans in the ruse tonight
Where heat and light touch the sky
And the sun is rising slow there's more to write
Lock of time written in my heart
Why were we once torn apart

Time we meet it's bittersweet",Pop

"My world contains a heart, right beside me....
I took a shot in the dark. Unfolding covers as I move...
With my hand on your chest, I can feel your heartbeat I lose...
With her skin so smooth! So careful not to wake you...
With the bloodshot eyes, I hold you tight, until I fall away, away from you....
In the early hours of a dark lit room...Waking up with the shock of lying next to you...
With the pupils dilated I can see an outline of you....Tracing you....
Hoping it's you....""the one"" out there that I felt...
Every night connected to you, and every time, I felt you move....
In the early hours of a dark lit room...Waking up with the shock of lying next to you...
With the pupils dilated I can see an outline of you....Tracing you....
At 3:30 am my world is turning! I pull her close to me by my arm wrapped around her tummy...
I re-align, remove the hair from her eyes, and memorize....Before I fall away.........
When our eyes collided, I felt the retina burn 
With this ring, forever! I'll hold you high, and we'll fall away in dreams.....
I always knew you were out there...I knew....Now I'm brand new....
Every time that you wanted to push so hard....I was there
Every time you lost your only God....I was there
Every time you lost all of your hopes....I felt you there
Every time that I felt so exposed....You felt me there

When our eyes collided, I felt the retina burn 
With this ring, forever! I'll hold you high....Forever......Forever.....
When our eyes collided, I felt the retina burn 
With this ring, forever! I'll hold you high, and we'll fall away in dreams.....

"Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood

And when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga but I will

If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you can catch one in ya wig
You see the Testarosa the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line, a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what ya friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler & Koch'll tear half of ya ass off
I'm not for the games I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga but I will
If I got to, kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around
Where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin' through in the hood wearin' Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I fill ya back wit' mac rounds
Ask 'Preme nigga 50 don't back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line boy I'mma air ya ass out
Screw ya face at me I wan' know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business wit' 'em I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind
All across the world like the globe's mine, yeah!
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood

Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin' at'cha head mayne?

And ya body is drippin' and full of lead man
I done been there, I done cocked that
It ain't never been a question I'm 'bout that
Don't go there, you'll get cocked at
And if ya plan to fuck around then reroute that
You'll never catch me ridin' around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit' dumb-d's
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper, so
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies

"This is the anthem of the day we took flight and now I'm staring up at these dreams from the sidewalk
Nothing will hold me down, like I'm 19 again with utter perfection.
And I still see this one bedroom, third floor apartment and some how your scent still bounces right off this rooftop.
These were the lyrics to the nights we had nothing to lose and everything t gain no moment unseen just you and me.
We went out for one last memory, our hopes so hight and with all our might now we'll write this final chapter that will last forever tonight.
All the start explode in the sky when you hold my hand, I wont ever, lets never look back ad thats a fact if you want I can be your fucking John Cusack
We can stay up all night watching the same old movies over and over again, they will never get old as long as in the end I still have you to hold.
This life is no longer one size fits all, its everything you wanna be its everything you wanna believe.
So sit down and drink up were at the point where, we're all fed up, we're all fed up.
Now we move three years forward with no regrets and nothing left unsaid as our hearts beat in sync, we'll gain momentum with every step we take.
This is our chance to reclaim everything that they try to take away but its just not worth it, the suns gonna rise again
The sun will rise again!
And I won't forget all of theose nights spent under all those city lights And I wont forget all of those nights spend under all those city lights.
This life is not longer one size fits all, its everything you wanna be its everything you wanna believe.
So sit down and drink us we're at the point where, we're all fed up, we're all fed up
This life is no longer one size fits all, its everything you wanna be, its everything you wanna believe. So sit down and drink up were at the point where we're all fed up, we're all fed up",Pop

Stay with Me We can outlast night

We outlasted evenings, and I barely breathed
How couldn't I see? How couldn't I see?
Don't turn your eyes if You leave now
You won't remember me
You weren't meant to do this on your own.
No, I feel the water is calling
The wood under our bare feet cries
Every animal came to watch
The first and last to love die.
What a wretched man I am
Who will rescue Me from this body of death?
Don't turn your eyes if You leave now
You won't remember me
You weren't meant to do this on your own
Just stay close and I'll keep You from leaving
Just move slow and I'll keep You breathing.

und so kam es nach ein paar durchzechten Nächten an der Sektbar,
daß mein Geld auf einmal wieder weg war
Drei Pleitegeier, die Taschen voller Sand
die alte Leier: keine Kohle, nur Flaschenpfand
mit dem Luxus - Luxus - ist Schluß

I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you've
Hurt your cause forever
I hope you think you're clever
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy too
I hope you're proud how you would
Grovel in submission
To feed your own ambition
So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy

You can still be with the Wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted
I know
But I don't want it
No!
I can't want it anymore
Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by
The rules of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes
And leap
It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you can't pull me down
Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?
I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But till I try I'll never know
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love, I guess I've lost
Well if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost
I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down!
Glinda, come with me. Think of what we could do together!
Unlimited
Together we're unlimited
Together we'll be the greatest team
There's ever been, Glinda!
Dreams the way we planned 'em
If we work in tandem
There's no fight we cannot win
Just you and I, defying gravity
With you and I defying gravity
They'll never bring us down!
Well, are you coming?
I hope you're happy
I hope your happy now that your choosing this
You too
I hope it brings you bliss
I really hope you get it
And you don't live to regret it
I hope you're happy in the end
I hope you're happy my friend
So if you care to find me
Look to the Western sky!
As someone told me lately
Everyone deserves the chance to fly

At least I'm flying free
To those who ground me
Take a message back from me!
Tell them how I am defying gravity
I'm flying high, defying gravity

And nobody in all of Oz
No wizard that there is or was

She's wicked
Get her!
Bring me down!
No one mourns the wicked

"So you got a new car
The music's blasting through the speakers
You won the lottery two days ago
You say it changed
Your life forever
You despise everyone
Who is not like you
You say that's the only way
To survive these days
You quit smoking
'Cause you said if you smoke you die
And became a vegetarian the very next day
Think that's all that's gonna take to make up for the past

What you're gonna do with all the money?
And how you're gonna sleep at nights?
And where you're gonna go in the morning?
When you're gonna realize this isn't what you want?
So you just drove to the park
Walk in the dark
And remember how you used to be
Just you and the city
Where everything's real
Where the mailman knows who you are
And where there's always a place to go when you need to cry
Just in case you don't have enough reasons to go crazy

What you're gonna do with all the money?
And how you're gonna sleep at nights?
And where you're gonna go in the morning?
When you're gonna realize this isn't what you want?
You say that's a perfect life
I don't want it
You say that's a perfect life

"Love writes a letter and sends it to Hate:
""My vacation's ending, I'm coming home late
The weather was fine and the ocean was great
And I can't wait to see you again.""
Hate reads the letter and throws it away
""No one here cares if you go or you stay
I barely even noticed that you were away
I'll see you or I won't, whatever.""
Love sings a song as she sails through the sky
The water looks bluer through her pretty eyes
And everyone knows it whenever she flies
And also when she comes down
Hate keeps his head up and walks through these streets
Every stranger and drifter he greets
And shakes hands with every loner he meets
With a serious look on his face
Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow
Carrying with her the good things we know
A reason to live and a reason to grow
To trust and to hold and to care
Hate sits alone on the hood of his car
Without much regard to the moon or the stars
Lazily killing the last of a jar
Of the strongest stuff you can drink
Love takes a taxi, a young man drives
As soon he sees her hope fills his eyes
But tears follow after at the end of the ride
Because he might never see her again
Patience, patience, patience
Hate gets home lucky to still be alive
He screams over the sidewalk and into the drive
The clock in the kitchen says 2:55
And the clock in the kitchen is slow
Love has been waiting patient and kind
Just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign
That the one that she cares for who's out of his mind
Will make it back safe to her arms
Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door
Weary head hung down, eyes to the floor
He says, ""Love, I'm sorry,"" and she says, ""What for?
I'm yours and that's it, whatever
I should not have been gone for so long
I'm yours and that's it, forever
Your mine and that's it, forever""",Country
"They made you wait, so lonely
You felt like the waiting wore you out
And the wearing down
You felt like you were playing the whole part again
They made arrangements for flowers and candles
Told you to stop asking, saying why do you keep on saying again
And I'm standing on top of you
Wondering how, just which way it goes
And wondering just how this is you and me
Establishing gravity, pushing through and pushing
Pushing through February again
And the car was left halfway between the accident and out of town
You didn't mention it as you walked through the door

Into the lap of the lady that I love
And though she begged and she cajoled
I couldn't tell her what I was thinking of
I didn't chose, no I was chosen
By a life that must be lived in passing through
And though she changed so much of me
Changing this is the one thing I cannot do
Darling, I'm leaving
The distance keeps calling me on
Darling, come morning
I'll be gone
She is beauty, she is graceful
In a poison she is gentle in her care
She is the calm within the centre of my storm
She is her fingers through my hair
She has my heart but it is breaking
Cause it knows that deep inside she still believes
That there will ever come a morning when I'm staying
Not gathering to leave
Darling, I'm leaving
The distance keeps calling me on
Darling, come morning
I'll be gone
Baby let's get out of the city
We need to breathe some cleaner air

But only for one night with no repeat.
And maybe you'll go away and never call,

I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,

So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.
Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down

And see that every move I make is a dance just for your gaze
That every single action is a means not to an end
An opposite reaction to the diffidence we claim
So paint me, take me, hate me, claim me make me something more
Something better than the black and white that coloured me before
I want to feel your body and your hands upon my chest
To feel my emptiness
So bury me beneath the pines
In the shallow soil
In the filth and grime
And still this heart will yearn for you
So I've hatched upon a plan, a scheme of dervish wit
A pilot light to guide me through the caverns of your heart
I take this knife upon myself and gouge a shallow track

Cause all I wanna do is thank her
I'm using beautiful and gorgeous in the same verse

And hope we can get acquainted what I'm highly hopin'

And I just hope this got you motivated
That's cause your body got me cultivated
Seeing your fine ass alone I just can't tolerate it
And all your friends say I'm a dog every conversation
Mad cause you smiling more on a daily basis
Tell me why they hating everything's accommodated
I'm just searching for your love but I'll be very patient
True story had a thing before we started dating
Say she never heard beautiful so many times
Silly guys approaching with all wrong lines
That's a reason for being a single a long time

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow

Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've felt behind
Cause I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away

Who's daughter, who's daughter's on that stage?
I know her, I know her by her name
Who's daughter, who's daughter's on that stage?
She's a queen, now watch her
She's drowning ace of spades
She dances, and she dances, and she drops it
The crowd is yelling pop it, there's a reason she can't stop it
She dances, and she dances, and she pops it
The crowd is yelling drop it, there's a reason she can't stop it
This a
Funeral, death of your innocence
Little Lily grown up, barely legitimate
All these niggas in here got you scared to be intimate
So you just stand there, dance til you temperate
Dance til you in a wick
Dance til you in a wick
You don't feel the flame now, dance to rekindle it
Ran backstage did the bump in the bathroom
Kiss a few strangers and dance til you feeling it
And just keep dropping to the floor
Whatever you moved on to, you can let it go
And just keep dancing on the stage
Instead of throwing ones it's white lilies to her face
Then she got me backstage like
""Let me see your conscience
I'll be over dancing at the table of contents""
You can turn my pages
All these pages are like wages
And I would have quit so long
But all the money I'll be making got me
Dropping to the floor
Whatever you moved on to, you can let it go
She just keep dancing in my face
Instead of throwing ones it's white lilies to the stage
She lets go, says she has it under control
I count slow, hoping that she'll divulge some more
'Cause she knows, everything a woman should know
And I want, nothing but to see it up close
And she keep saying ""just grab it if you see what you like""
And I keep asking if this is what you want with your life
I find the flowers harden out in haunted houses
They somehow escape the gardens and walked out into the concrete and now
Everytime I see her she be walking to the pole
Panties, bra, bra inside, dropping to the floor
She climb up, up, up, up, hiding on the pole
She walk out with all her precious petals gone and now
We can find, roses with no petals in here
We can find, lilies spray painted metal in here
We can find, them dancing with the devil in here
Those white lines and, those white lies
Step off the stage and I'm back in a trance
With you we're interstellar, I'm gassing your nebula
All other flowers, they pale in comparison
That's why my florist's hand's slowly caressing you
One petals, two petals, back on the floor
Touch me, then tease me, then back on your cloak
Everything's seemingly Puerto Rico
This worthless from verses was stirring your soul
Swear I'm not putting you down, though
I just hate seeing you drown, slow
You say your mind frame is twisted and shit
That your faith in humanity's ground floor
I'm always one that say think on your own
Free is the flower who rose from my home
But I'd rather watch you be seated in power than steadily seeing you being dethroned
I found the flowers being drowned in dirty water
They somehow escape the farmers and are headed out to slaughter and now
Everytime I see her she be walking to the pole
Panties, bra, bra inside, dropping to the floor
She climb up, up, up, up, hiding on the pole
She walk out with all her precious petals gone and now
We can find, roses with no petals in here
We can find, lilies spray painted metal in here
We can find, them dancing with the devil in here
Those white lines and, those white lies",Hip-Hop
"This is where it begins
This is where all the worry ends
This is where I say I don't need to have control
This is where I admit
I don't know how to handle it
Life in all of this chaos
You're my only hope
And all that I have to offer
Is the white flag of surrender
So take me to the middle of Your heart
Lead me to wherever Your love starts
To a new day dawning
To the place You are
And if You want to take me over the edge
I'll let you cause Your love is where I'll land
Wanna be right where You are,
In the middle of Your heart
This is what I believe
That if I give you my everything
I will become who I was really born to be
I'll stand up and say it
Yeah, Your love is something I can put my faith in
So take me to the middle of Your heart
Lead me to wherever Your love starts
To a new day dawning
To the place You are
And if You wanna take me over the edge
I'll let you cause Your love is where I'll land
Wanna be right where You are,

What I carry
But now I can let it go
Yeah I carry it
Lord I carry it
But now I can let it go
Yeah I can let it go
So take me to the middle of Your heart
Lead me to wherever Your love starts
To a new day dawning

To the police, y'all gotta start us out
Xzibit dun came I'm here and got a nigga high
Now how come y'all be messin' with me
When you find out that I'm a star?

And just because I'm cool with y'all

Bitches callin', tryin' to get the dick of the Quikster

It be the little kids acknowledging that I'm the nigga
I'm sorta like a role model, they love me
I ain't half-assed, pullin' full throttle
Now pass the bottle but hold up for me, pal
Could you make it a corona with Limon Esalle?
And could you send them in these on
So we could show these down
So all my little Hispanic homies could pound-pound
This is underground-ground, the new WS sound
But I'm thinkin' that y'all thinkin' that we all just clown

And make us sit out
So put a hit out on the authorities
'cause they thinkin' we don't know they got a sorority
Fuck the who? I ain't sayin' hit like in death
I'm talkin' hit records crackin' when you bust that left
Outta Carson and Watts
South Central L.A., back to your spot
Compton niggas, we got the show shot
Orgasmic beats that keep these hoes hot
Put your lips on my glass, you're doin' a whole lot
Ball till you fall, nigga
99 bottles, I'm buyin' the whole wall
This is the role call, nigga
All us fly niggas gon'' ball
If you hatin' then we don't know y'all, nigga

Five in the mornin' and the phone's still ringin'
Been a nine year party ever since I started singin' tonight
But it's a whole lot betta
It ain't no jealousy, no snitches, or no feda'
I'm gittin' drunk, I'm sayin' fuck it with my friends
And I'm spoiled, 'cause my muthafuckin' bucket is a Benz
And I'm lookin' for my niggga X
With the hydroponic, bubonic, bionic
Chase it with some gin 'n' tonic
Now who got the balls enough to hit that bong
And straight pass out ,'cause the shit that strong?
But the 1's gotta leave us alone 'cause we ain't' doin' wrong
I'm the music and Black Tone's the backbone
Got your daughter back grown
Ebony and Ivory, baby, the little white girl
Little black songs, get on

At a soldier's khaki sleeve.

Perhaps you know my daddy, sir;
'Cause he's a soldier, too.

When you were fighting over there?
I thought perhaps by chance
You met him there in France,
Or somewhere over there
Across the sea.

The best pal he ever had.

This complex puzzle that is my life
Thirsty for knowledge
But drinking from poisoned fountains
Flashbacks from my past

Bleak inner self touched by pride,
Devoured by solitude, still wrapped in time.
I'm flowing with pain!
Holding myself back in suspicion
And lingering in the dust
The dust of my abandoned remains.
Killed with the dagger of life
Such an exquisite pride in my suffering
Alone, all alone with the emotional
Streams of my soul
So real, so pure yet I'm left aside
Entangled in fear without hope.
I am truly left alone,
But somehow just somehow
It feels like my loneliness is a victory
Over the self-delusion of joy and happiness.

The anguish becomes clearer
And my misanthropic view gets stronger.
Living in the shadows
So proud of being the one,
But desperate
So desperate for a helping hand.
Do I really want to live this life?
I have a thousand reasons to die,
And many millions of tears to cry in silence.
The human plague has emptied my life,
And I curse the day I was born to this world!
Still, no-one else I ever want to be
And no-one else I intend to be
'Cause no-one else I was meant to be!
I need, I want, I long for my retribution
I need, I want, I yearn for my retribution
I want my retribution I want it now!

Of dark of dark clean spirits
What a dream what a dream so distant!

When I love when I love my brotherhood?

Holding slippers in his hands

You're stuck in nowhere, break out of nowhere!
It feels like a dream now
but it's not a dream now
Do you know, where you can hide?
There's not a place, where you can hide!
You'll lose your control and...

"Born to lose I've lived my life in vain every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear how I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through born to lose and now I'm losing you

Born to lose my every hope is gone it's so hard to face an empty dawn

It's because of you I was able to
Give my heart again, you gave me

I didn't want to face nor even see another day
Suddenly form nowhere, baby you appeared
You dried my tears, you cared for me
Baby you love for me, truly rescued me
It's because of you, I was able to
Fall in love again, you gave me
For long in my life, I wouldn't let love inside
But I swallowed my pride the day you arrived
Now that your by my side
Everything is alright
It's because of you I was able to
Give my heart again, you gave me",R&B
"The realm's bleeding
It suffers -
Old and weak
No further arguing
There is war at hand
The system's failing
Engine's running
Then after all
I sense the end is dawning
These lunatics deny the truth
I know I will not fail
There'll be
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

It's now or never
We shall stand together

You chase in twilight
And you know
You will be on your own
On your own
The misery shown
I'll be alone in this hour
I face the unknown
Witness the end
I'm bleeding. I'm fading
Here in my final hour
When long lost memories return
And a voice keeps calling
""All dead and gone
It's out of hand
Life is in motion""
I'm wishing. I'm fading
""Time to wake up
Face the truth""
I'm sinking
I'm drowning
There's no doubt and no regret
""Time to reveal now""
This is no illusion
It is real
Carry on the flame
It's not over now
Watch me, I will rise
Time to reveal now
I know I will not fail

I'm the one forever

It's now or never
We shall stand together

This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Yesterday's gone
There's no today, no tomorrow
I'm raised from the dead
The ritual failed
There at the gates
I'm left alone in this hour
Driven insane
I am left alone
And now I drown in deepest shadows
While the golden hall is sealed
I'm wishing
I'm fading
And I'm part of the machine
My eyes are the eyes of a dead man
And feel the unholy stream
The source of my power
T-energy
I'm in control
I will live forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
I spread my wings
But keep on falling
I should have known
I can see it coming
The war is over

Just let me out of here

There's no end

Is that I'm not insane

Pump it up until you can feel it.

Listen to the propaganda,
Listen to the latest slander.
There's nothing underhand
That she wouldn't understand.
Pump it up until you can feel it.
Pump it up when you don't really need it.

Shes like a chemical.
Though you try to stop it,
Shes like a narcotic.
You wanna torture her.
You wanna talk to her.
All the things you bought for her,
Putting up your temperature.
Pump it up until you can feel it.
Pump it up when you don't really need it.
Out in the fashion show,
Down in the bargain bin,
You put your passion out
Under the pressure pin.
Fall into submission,
Hit-and-run transmission.

Pump it up when you don't really need it.",Rock

"Well, once jolly swagmen* went humping their swags
and stuffed jolly jumbucks* down in their tucker bags
These days, jolly junkies go on house-breaking jags
and steal to buy the poison they need
While the swaggie, he just wanted a feed
And who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?
Hey Banjo*, this country's not what it used to be
We've changed all your words, and re-written your score
And it's ""Waltzing Matilda"" no more.
Once Henry and Mary, on a warm afternoon
rowed down Reedy River to the broad bright lagoon
The song of the river is a long vanished tune
since they built the uranium mine
and what's left is just toxic slime
And who'll come a-walting Matilda with me?
Oh, Henry, this country's not what it used to be
Days pass with a whimper, and not with a roar
And it's ""Waltzing Matilda"" no more.
Well, we cut down the trees, and the land we reclaimed
We ploughed and we planted, then we ploughed it again
and again and again, and again and again
So that now on a hot windy day
We can watch our topsoil blow away
And who'll come a-walting Matilda with me?
The desert is marching down to the sea
On the day that it stretches
from shore to shining shore
We'll go waltzing Matilda no more
Saturday night outside a King's Cross hotel
There stands our future, and it's halfway to hell
Kids with hard drugs and young bodies to sell
Hey Australia, what progress we've made!
We've come a long way, since Diamond day
And who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?
Hey Anzac*, is this what you fought to keep free?
A land fit for heroes, or junkies and whores?
And it's ""Waltzing Matilda"" no more.
And who'll come a-walting Matilda with me?
This country could still be what we want it to be
Perhaps one day soon, the dream will be restored
And we'll go Waltzing Matilda once more
We'll go Waltzing Matilda once more
NOTES:
ANZAC:
The combined Australia/New Zealand armies that fought in both World Wars
""Banjo"" Patterson:
Author of ""The Man From Snowy River"" and ""Waltzing Matilda""
Billabong:
A watering hole, specifically the curved meander of a winding stream
that has been isolated due to sand bar deposition
Swagman:
I believe in the US you refer to them as ""hobos"", though a swaggy is not
always someone financially down on their luck or On The Run. Some
swagmen are just fed up with city life and want to spend their time
exploring the country on foot, living off the land and the charity of
passers-by as best they can.
Coolibah tree:
The Eucalyptus Coolibah is a species of Eucalyptus tree commonly found
in inland parts of the Australian continent.
Billy:
A billy is a tin, often an old used fruit tin or other steel container,
used to boil water to make tea. Often they have a piece of wire
across their top used as a handle, whereupon after the water is boiling,
one holds the wire, places the desired amount of tea leaves in said
water, stands up, and swings the whole billy in a circular motion
vigorously in order to force the tea leaves to the bottom of the tin. A
rather nice touch is to crush a Coolibah leaf into the water too, giving
the tea a hint of eucalyptus.
Jumbuck;
A sheep 
Tucker-bag;
A knapsack. ""Tucker"" means ""food"".
Squatter:
In Australia in the 19th century, large swathes of outback land were
divided up and mostly allocated to ""squatters"" - often wealthy
land-owners from Britain, who could afford the prices the government was
asking. There were also freehold selections free for the taking  made available to anyone who
would try to exploit the land, but the freehold lots tended to be poorer
land where it was a battle to earn to living. Squatters became fairly
wealthy from their allocations even taking over freehold selections in
the process of expanding their lots, reflected in the fact that this one
is riding on his thoroughbred horse.
Troopers:
The troopers are law enforcement. The squatter would have called
them in because the swagman has stolen a sheep from the squatter's property.
Matilda:
Given the lonely life of a swaggy, they tend to become quite
affectionate for things that are fairly important to their immediate
existence. In this case, AIUI ""Matilda"" is the swagman's sleeping gear -
typically a bedroll.

That I do share the air
That blows the bells she sings along without a care
I hope her hands do find

The folded feelings that I know I left behind

"On a night just like this, in a place far away
He met with a giri in the spring
And something about him just turned her around
As though she were caught on a string
And being so young they held on to each other
To see what the moment might bring
He loved her then in a secretive way
Not showing his care or his need
She stayed beside him and looked to the day
He would somehow begin to be free
In the chill of the night she would hold him and say
This is how they always should be
Rocks in the ocean, waves on the sea
Keep it in mind,
If love comes unsatisfied, don't forget me
Don't forget me
And so he come to depend on her more
Though the lesson was still to be learned,
Taking for granted the gift that she gave
As though it were something he'd earned
And she for her part growing slowly away
From a love that was never returned
Then came the day that he never foresaw
When he woke to find she was gone
He followed her then to the ends of the world
To tell her how much he'd been wrong
But the more he called her, the more she was lost
Leaving only the words of her song
Rocks in the ocean, waves on the sea
Keep it in mind,
If love comes unsatisfied, don't forget me
Don't forget me
He still listens out for her foot on the stair
As he looks for her down through the years
And the friends that he had have all left one by one
For their words weren't reaching his ears
He chooses instead now to wander alone
To a song that only he hears
Rocks in the ocean, waves on the sea
Keep it in mind,
If love comes unsatisfied, don't forget me
Don't forget me",Rock

That is higher than the trees

I dream of you
Maybe someday
You will come true
I can be the singer
Or the clown in every room
I can even call someone
Take me to the moon
I can put my makeup on
And drive the men insane
I can go to bed alone

And as I drove myself back home

Wanna capture things
Find someone who understands
And I'll miss you till I meet you

Just to feel my way
Find my better self

All dreamed away

Oceans of wisdom run so deep and sublime

Sold us a dream full of pain and despair
So lost in illusion we haven't a prayer

Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar
And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

""Seems like a distant car?""

I took a number off the shelf
It don't matter my age
'Cause every time I saw myself
It hurt to touch

They hurt the good
They hurt the truth
The fool followed the cars

I adore is why?

"Lonesome Road Blues
I walked on down that lonesome line
Hung my head and I cried
I wept and I cried under a willow tree
Out by the deep blue sea
My mama, my dear papa can be found,
And my brother on a county road
Now I been down that long plank walk,
I?m on my way back home
You cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan
You cause me to leave my home
I cried last night and the night before
I swear I won?t cry anymore
Your fast mail train comin round that track
Killed my brown eyed boy
They took him down that smokey track
Brought him back on a cooling board
Now I?m lookin down that lonesome line
Just as far as I care to see
I have no money lost my brown eyed boy
These blues won?t set me free",Country

The old thatched cottage has fallen down
I dry my eyes as I fondly remember
The days of long ago when I was young
In my fathers house we were poor but rich in love
No TV but music there was plenty of
My mama hummed her melodies and we all sang along
In my fathers house when I was young
Come the time when I am older
My own children are reared and gone
I wonder then will they fondly remember
The days of long ago when they were young
In my father's house, a smile would greet you at the door
A gentle word, weary travelers they're was welcome for
And at night time neighbors rambled in
And might stay 'til twelve or one
In my father's house when I was young
The years have passed and times are changing
The rambling house has almost gone
But I still hear the laughter of children
Just as long ago when I was young

And pain and candles everywhere and incense
And your dream which I wish to wake up in every day...

And this blood and candles burnt away; and they burn till today

I met someone by accident
That blew me away
That blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away
And I wish I could lay down beside you

And wake up to your face under the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
I'm sure you'll go one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I dropped you off at the train station
And put a kiss on top of your head
I watched you wave
I watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call it home
And I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
I'm sure you'll go one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I woke up feeling heavy hearted
I'm going back to where I started

The morning rain
And you know I wish that you were here
But that same old road that brought me here
Is calling me home
Is calling me home

Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin
Niggaz be schemin, I'm fiendin to live a good life
The fiends just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

I want the finer things in my life

I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me

Send me them seeds i'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And I'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
I sold everythin I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA recrock
What goes in my mind, its contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be poke and butter
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man

Its a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes

Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them holi tip bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake

But that gusher never came in.
And the river was a boundary
Where my darling and I used to swim.
One night in the moonlight,
The swiftness swept his life away.

And Lake Shasta is where I will stay.
There's the South San Joaquin
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found.
And theres a place called Mt. Whitney
From where the mighty Kern River comes down.

He lives in a four by two glass box
It reminds me of my head
I wish my floor would have rocks,
But it's covered with puddles instead
If I could be him, life would be great
I could erase this permanent frown
I wouldn't even be held down by my own weight
I woke up walked to the tank to hear his thoughts on yesterday
How was it? I asked
And after a tap on the glass
He looked my way, then gave me this depressed expression
Impressed, it's best just to say
Besides the tides and the grey skies, it was okay
And I said Hey mister fish you get all that you wish
You've got, nothin' to complain about while hangin' out in this bitch
Well he replied, While existence is bliss, there's so much that you miss
Besides get off the trip, happiness is just a myth.
I said Livin' in water is extremely more peaceful than
Life confined to a mind, blinded by the evil
And forced to see through these two peep holes
It seems I've redeemed freedom, not being limited by walls but
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
That only means I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls

But Mr. Fish just laughed as I went on and on and on
So I interrupted his chuckle, puttin' up a middle finger
And he boldly told me it's too bad I'm such a thinker
So arrogantly I asked, How could someone think too much?
He added that insanity lingers and thoughts brought me to the brink of such
He said, You live inside a head that reminds me of my glass box
And everyone's the same; all brains are contained by your reality framed
And chained, to with the rain, its trained hard not to change
And once you see what I've explained you hit the jackpot
And at that very moment it was like my eyes really opened
The air that previously surrounded me was now an ocean
Still totally invisible except for minor pieces of debris
Then Mr. Fish pushed up to the glass and he looked just like me
My whole world spun around, I didn't understand
But I realized I was no longer a man
So I thought about what he said
And asked him what was going on
And he said, you didn't know it but you where the fish all along
He said, congratulations, you did it, you broke free
You're just a fish like the rest of humanity
Now it took me a long time to get adjusted to this tank
But now I know what I am, and so to that man I give thanks
I've always lived inside this glass box that reminds him of his head

"Injustice runs rampant in society
You can even find it in our own pretty democracy
Run!...Well no!
Or hide in a 9 to 5 and don't care to know
Impoverished and homeless don't have a choice
Well, why should they? The money took their voice
And it flows...
Only prepare at the next media scare...
Turn the TV on and tune out the sun
Opinions decisions seem so black and white
When we allow the media to chose our fight
Never talk of sex but condemn all abortion
Christian message is warped in transmitted distortion
Fell the sea sickening rush of the great capitalist flush
Spiraling down
The destruction of all that's in our way
When times get rough its time to pray
A Nation of greed
American apathy
A path and a blown away seed
Promoting self is the American way
Globalization of greed
Spiritual apathy
A path and a hollow seed
Structural collapse is on the way
We're living, survival of the richest
Echoes rise up from the pit
As the pendulum cuts them down
And our American world, spins around
Money makes money, while the poor can only get poorer
Our economic equations include the bottom mans horror
Some free men sit in prisons while some slaves sit in office
Prejudice issues manage to linger
We need reconciliation not pointing a finger
So what is our ticket out now
Where do we find truth?
Many have lost their minds or died
So we could indulge in our American pride
And now we glance at some at the corner
Who have been discarded and junked away
And forced they work up scams
To exist with me and you another day
Consume. Pollute. Hate. Destroy
Let go of possession, fear and pride
When witnessing injustice don't find a way to hide
Open our eyes to see every lie
Because you'll never find justice till the day

No ponerse el mundo por montera

"Y no me importa que me digan
que yo soy un viva la vida
porque vivo sin compromiso,

vida tengo na mas que una

con la baba llena de whisky.
Soy,
lo que tu quieras que sea
pero sin vergenza no soy,
cuando veo en esta puerca humanidad
tantos crmenes sin nombres,
de sin vergenza ni hablar

Cuando en una pasarela,
aparece una modelo,
con chaqu de lentejuelas,
y falda de terciopelo,
con andares impecables
y perfumes de chaneles,
me entran ganas de preguntarle,
t de qu comparsa eres?
Son fantsticas divinas,
de plstico y silicona,
son igual de femeninas
que el palo de una fregona.
Se entregan apasionadas
a los hombres gilipollas
porque estan enamoradas
del dinero y de las joyas
Yo prefiero seguir buscando
los defectos y los encantos
de una dama golfa y valiente,
verdadera como la guerra
despeinada como la tierra
y canalla como la gente,
yo prefiero una compaera
perfumada con la madera
con el cuero y con la palabra.

"In the Beartooth Mountains where the twin peaks touch the sky
There's a homemade cabin out of sight from tourists' eyes
And inside lightin' up a fire to fight the cold
Lives a miner's daughter with a heart as pure as gold
She's as gentle flowin' as the sweet grass on the plains
And I need her lovin' like the forest needs the rain
Like a rollin' river she just swept my heart away
Now I'm out here driftin' when I know I should've stayed
Oh, that west wind is callin' in skies of turqoise blue
And the creek is still runnin' like quicksilver dew
She was all that I needed, why did I ever leave?
Oh, her voice voice on the westwind is still callin' me
There's a cold wind blowin' through this mountain pass tonight
As I hold her memory to my heart it don't seem right
Just an empty cabin with a lock left on the door
Now I realize that I've lost the girl for sure
So I went up to Red Lodge to see if they might know
All the townfolk said that she left sometime ago
She just up and married with a nice young city man
I was a fool to let her slip right through my hands",Folk
"Somebody's threatened you, well, you know why
Time now to pay for misdeeds you deny
Life can be cheerless in intensive care
Keep a cool head and you won't know you're there
You won't need a shot when you sniff just a drop
Of the perfumes of paradise!
Bulldoze the street where they said you were born
Take a new name and before it put ""Lord""
Tranquil and slow, nostrils aglow with the perfumes of paradise
From my bed to the street it is 30 paces 
And I sniff and repent in all the right places
And a speeding truck crashes into the front door
And the telephone rings and says, ""Have you no conscience?""
When planning a genocide, starting a war
Say that it's gentler than others before
It sells lots of TV's and ribbons and flags
And makes all the doubters look spineless and bad
Even big heads of state should spray in their wake
The perfumes of paradise",Rock

That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""No""'s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

Jesus loved me
This I know
But why on earth
Did I ever let him go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine
A love like this will come but once
This I do believe
And I'll not see his like again
As I live and breath
And I'm sorry if I might offend
But I will never see
How the tenderness I shared with him
Became a heresy
Jesus loved me
This I know
But why on earth
Did I ever let him go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine
But I remember nights we spent
Whispering our creed
Our rituals, our sacraments
The stars our canopy
There beneath an olive tree
We'd offer up our plea
God's creation innocent
His arms surrounding me
Jesus loves me

If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir, With Love'
Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume?

"And now I'm trying to decide if I feel dirty at all
Cause it gets hard to tell
It's never just black and white she's got a mind of her own
And she uses it well
So she invites me over outside villanova
She's got some pull-out sofa that we won't hardly need
She is only drinking soda revving up that motor
Got places we could go to but I still won't believe
That she's only gifted
When I'm standing by her side
She goes unassisted
And I start to relax as I cut her some slack

So get up I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows
What I've done and what I'm gonna do ?again
And in the middle of the night I have a breakdown of sorts
With regret creeping in
She's gonna put up a fight and she will get her way
Cause she loves sleeping in
So I need someone to side with when she begins confiding
And I cannot provide it cause I'm endlessly cold
She says she's so excited to play some groom and bride
With me but I'm undecided so I need to be told
That she's only sinking
When I'm sleeping by her side
With a change of thinking
I could pull us away even just for a day

She grows impatient to change my tune
She's geting older and legal soon
And I wasn't ready to start out and go upsetting
Some girl that I'd be forgetting
By the time the cops came by that afternoon
And I try to decide as she pulls me aside

fist

Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher

Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain

And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin

On every block someones flippin like an acrobat

But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang

Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static

I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep

it is just a few little things
that you gotta know
a girl will give you all of her heart

When heartache first knocked on that old hurting door

It's like standing in winter and praying for spring

Have we become strangers one too many times
Can I live knowin' you used to be mine
Where does a heart cross the leaving line
If love was a perfection baby we had it all
But when you climb a mountain there are two sides to fall
I'm coming closer and closer to gone

"Sometimes when I visit the landscapes of the shadows
Something that recalls the grave
Hides in the hellish depths and awaits
When I dream, it peeks into empty goblet
 becomes the wine of ecstasy and licentiousness
I know the one in a flock said: ""Watch out, watch out""
But I will not go away till I taste the sweetness of your body
No matter it poisons and causes death
The past is like an eternal funeral
Years, thousands of them, I rotted in a monastic cell
I resembled a stone, hiding my murderous self in silence and fear
I lasted in the infinity of meditations and contamplations
Waiting for the deserved dream, there on the holy land
And its taste and coldness I remember
Bare-foot digging my own pit
I was kissing it as if the sweetest lover and begged
But was the sandto become my salvation
Or worms the people on the court of light
The past reeks of an oak coffin, so wet and old
Burning dirty claws in the wooden eyes of Jehova
I killed mercy, spotting on the laws of god
I celebrated the birth of power
I fall in love with freedom and the beast
And I spat out the Antichrist from my morbid womb
In order to give life to alvine grain
And concentrate the birth of human tragedy & destruction
I envisaged myself as a great magician
Althought they called armageddon the whore
Today I celebrate my birth, though I am elder than the world
The past only sometimes is like the sind
That we grave-digger throws in your eyes.",Metal

There aint no reason why they always walk away
No good reason they seize you, disease you, then leave you undone

Angelina, as you weep in your sleep theres an ivory glow
And Angelina, you can choose win or lose where your new heart will go
There will be empty spaces where holes fill the places that your sad eyes wants youse to see
And in the mirror your tricks lines you cant lie the race that your life you used to lead

And the good things that stay will all shine as you walk in the sun

But we'll set sail and we'll be gone
We're sailing on
We're sailing on
Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun

On The Wild Sea

Now we're taking on water
In the Dead Dog's Galley
A man overboard everyday
Captured by pirates
In the isle of donuts
Rescued by some maidens
Who then ran away
And here's where we'll be
We never know what we'll see
We can battle ghosts
On the bottom of the ocean
Or ride the waves
Of The Wild Sea
Now the Sun she's shining for everyone
But we'll set sail and we'll be gone
We're sailing on
We're sailing on
Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun
My boat, A Viking, My dad and me
On The Wild Sea
Captain's Log: 1978
We've been on the sea now for over three years
And the unbelievable things we've found and seen,
No man can write.
Things like the discovery of the Purple Pearl of Pinoche,
The mysterious island of Bigfoot Women,
The SeaGhost in the Isle of Dread,
Pirates on the sea - pirates that no man can name -
The underwater bison family . . . and much more . . .
Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun
My boat, A Viking, My dad and me
On The Wild Sea

Do you hear that son?
That's the voice of the Sirens calling from the sea.
Quick! Put some cloth in your ears!
Don't steer towards the island!
The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me",R&B
"In a taxi chasing for the sun,
All around us strangers everyone,
With no hope for what they hope for,
We could drive all of our tears away.
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho.
In a taxi ride that ends too soon,
The city skyline tries to kick the moon,
We have no time for what they wait for,
We can drive all of our tears away.
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho run run away,
Maybe we could run away,
Oh oh ho.
You and I against the walled in generation,
You and I could kick the walls away,

We can run fast we can run far.

Are you looking for each other
Around your old selves again

Is this the love that got lost

What if you just let time show
Is it worth it, is it sane, when love goes away again

Can you trust him, can you take his word
Can you really really give him yours

My reasons for us fallin' out
Of love I want to fall back in
My life is different now I swear
I know now what it means to care
About somebody other than myself
I know the things I said to you
They were untender and untrue
I'd like to see those things undo
So if you could find it in your heart
To give a man a second start
I promise things won't end the same
Shame, boatloads of shame
Day after day, more of the same
Blame, please lift it off
Please take it off, please make it stop
Okay so I have read the mail
The stories people often tell
About us that we never knew
But their existence will float away
And just like every word they say
And we will hold hands as they fade
Shame, boatloads of shame
Day after day, more of the same
Blame, please lift it off
Please take it off, please make it stop
I felt so sure of everything
My love to you so well received
And I just strutted around your town
Knowing I didn't let you down
The truth be known, the truth be told
My heart was always fairly cold
Posing to be as warm as yours
My way of getting in your world
But now I'm out and I've had time
To look around and think
And sink into another world
That's filled with guilt and overwhelming
Shame, boatloads of shame
Day after day, more of the same
Blame, please lift it off
Please take it off, please make it stop
And everyone they have a heart
And when they break and fall apart
They need somebody's helping hand
I used to say just let 'em fall
It wouldn't bother me at all
I couldn't help them now I can",Country

Mama when my dollies have babies
And I am a big lady
Mama will a prince come and take me away
When I said these things I believed in kings
Then I didn't know love could hurt me so
Slowly she replied, tears had filled her eyes
Baby not so fast let your young life last

I sang to her in fun, my teens had just began
My age was not the same still we played the game
Her eyes were filled with pride and slowly she replied
Soon enough you'll be a very pretty bride

Mama, will the hurt go away deep inside

My poor world had gone along
All my early dreams has turned to crystal streams
My love it was last and more tears have past

And as he passed me by
He turned and gave me a smile

You are leaving me stranded
You know that it should have been me baby
Oh baby gettin' ready to marry you
Darlin' darlin' darlin'
You made a promise that we would never part
Then you turned around and broke my little heart
Now you're standing there saying I do
Holding hands with somebody new
You know that it should have been me

Instead of her standing by you
You know that it should have been me
It should have been me

That there be silence please
If anybody objects to this wedding
Speak now or forever or forever hold your peace

Looking for some hip so I can skip
I spotted this honey dip, and her friend tried to sell me a script
That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the old Gus
So I'm getting a bus, as I thrill at the disgust
Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business
Dipping from a distance, in an instance I got the digits
and blew a kiss to her
That old stank hoe, was mad I didn't speak to her
I hooked up with the one that looked nice
Took her mind, like an ice!
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill
They told her to keep that booty still
I been through more hoes than the pill
Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty 
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was getting knocked
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell
Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat
Like a belt, everything was strapped
'Til my homey asked, ""What's up with that?""
The that was like dis G, I told him I got busy
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy
That was foul, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end

Take this dream I'm wishing for

I'll miss you most whenever October winds begin to blow
Well these days have lost their meaning
And these nights can feel so cold
Endless days not ever knowing

I was not there as the kitten died

I swallow your pain and stick blood into me
Suck moss and needles, the faces of burrs

In the toilet in the kittenchen
On the glassblue sea the birds see
I am your mirror

Etched in clouds trailing
Making curtains of waves
The broken face peeps

I see you monster
I see you monster
My back and jaw hunch and feel
You there
You are the cuckoo, the train, the muffled drum
You say, ""I am echo
I am cleaner of floors
Sower of sores""
And policeman in brambles and bubbles
Call the beauty to rest
Say, ""I am echo""
And rise with peacocks
Feral and horizon
The beauty moved over me
And the beauty crashed down over my body
With wine and dreams creeping down from the bookcases

Kill me and leave the cat to G+D and rain and pussy willows""

when's he gonna learn he only has to ask
Blame the teachers, blame the school
Blame the parents, come on blame one and all
Blame the coppers, blame the drugs
Blame the system, but don't blame us
Schoolteachers sing you won't come to anything
There's no future in playing these dives
But looking back today we won't have another way
Because we had the times off our lives
Out of school, out off work and out of cigarettes
We'll all have some breakfast if he wins the bet
All the posing & posturing never made much sense
Little boys, little man, little innocence
Blame the teachers, blame the school
Blame the parents, come on blame one and all

Where you gonna look for confirmation?
And if it's ever gonna happen
So as I'm standing at the station
It might be over soon

There I find you marked in constellation 
There isn't ceiling in our garden
And then I draw an ear on you
So I can speak into the silence
It might be over soon 


Oh and I have carried consecration
And then you expelled all decision
As I may stand up with the vision
Caught daylight, goddamn right
Within our eyes there lies a scission

Will I ever see past the man in the mirror?
Is it worthless for me to think that I will ever be anything?
Rip off this facade of shame, its haunting me

Throw down the cast of the world on the ground
The broken mirror before me, the jagged glass at my feet

I wanna bathe in your holy blood

To a man been forced out of his home
I'll send a prayer out across the ocean
So that he may not suffer there alone
I want to drink from your cup of sorrow
I wanna bathe in your holy blood
I want to sleep with the promise of tomorrow

I want to sit at your table of wisdom
So that not one crumb shall go to waste

Well, our children will suffer for our haste

Where darkness meets the moonlight
I will sing a melody 'til the morning comes
Living for you only
Take my hand and show me
There will be much sorrow when the morning comes
Fearless I'm fighting the pain burns inside of me
Find the forces of my soul
No one can understand me
Am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone?

In this castle where affliction reigns
So many died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again!

My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me

Under the stars where we'll shine again some day

Fear is leading to the night
Bloodline of vampires doomed to fulfill their need
Once united by the light

I shall kill you tonight to avenge

Rage and hate
Is what I felt just before it came
What it once was fear
Now it's the purest lust
On the search for eternity
We've forgotten all the sins
To foresee our destiny
And regain what we've lost
Betrayed by the light
Only one vision in hopeless times
Betrayed by the night
Corrupted minds closing their eyes
Now you're in front of the truth
But you can't really see on through
After all what you've done
There is no solution, it's all gone

For all you've seen
And tasted
Preemptive solution
Forgotten once, is all now comming back!
Don't hear what they say
Don't see what they are
Just look in your mind
And be the strongest you can
Dreams and thoughts
Are about to be real
Your path is unknown
Starvation will come
Faces turn around
And you can't remember where they're from
Chased in your mind
By the creatures ever dreamt
Twisted voices
Are starting to make you really mad
And forget what you are
Welcome to the last ride

Awake
Tears in her eyes
As you watch her drown in her lies
You hear the screams
Of the suffering souls
Betrayed by their minds
Now you've seen what's all about to be real
But this time there's no comming out
So prepare for your final destination
And beg for your soul to resist all your fears!

Betrayed by the night...

Design of drowning the first born son of man
Hands of cold and empty condemning in bastard choice
These teeth of heresy speak of promised ruin
Bow before my vengeance
I am masked for death in rage of this worship of disease
In red skies my words are weapons of hell
Conjuration through this death of falling skies
Hatred swarms this lethal rage
This vision repulsed within guidance
Vulgar temptation in hands of two
These scars are worm as praise
Soft breast of virgin's touch
Deceit in the birth of lust
Adultery of the serpent has brought forth the birth of rape
Arise in anointed skin of chaos
Seething the priceless warmth of the butchering of god
Sickness returns in this baptized pool
Unholy rise in spear of lies
This blood pours from the rib of man
Empty oceans of drowned souls filter into the veins of god
Corrupt this bloodline to taint the righteous birth

"I once met a man who trained himself not to dream
What he seems to have seen was a glimpse of everything
He's been painting pictures on canvas since age thirteen
And claims he only exists in the mind of a higher being
And I enjoy his work; mostly scenic landscapes
But each one is focused on an easel where the man paints himself painting himself
And all that's in his visual field
He said this was the only way he could make himself real
Ever since he could remember, he had one nightmare reoccur
But until about ten years ago, it didn't matter
It consisted of loud, distorted sounds echoing off the concrete
He ran on top of it in attempt to reach a ladder
Now sometimes, he'd get so close but never touch his destination
Which caused him much frustration 'cause he didn't know what it meant
And by the end of the dream, he saw the scene from a bird's eye
Only to witness his dead body laying on the cement
It was only to witness his dead body laying on the cement
At first it freaked him out, but after a while he grew content
So he thought, ""It's just a dream,"" and kept living his life
Writing his soul on the canvas 'cause it sheds his planet light
And it goes on and on like space and time, ain't nothing odd
It's not that he didn't believe, he just didn't approve of God
His experience was one I couldn't comprehend
'Till I stopped being detective and listened to him as a friend
He said

He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
It was then that he knew he was the art of divinity
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
A brush stroke of the gods made him one note in their symphony
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
He spoke for himself and not the rest of humanity
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
And I realize that I'm not real
God just imagined me
It's like I said
About ten years ago, the event that changed his whole reality
Took place on his monthly trip to the local art gallery
It was there where he studied his contemporaries
And there where he nearly carried his sanity to a hole and buried it forever
It was a very mysterious day
The place was almost empty
And he got chills down his spine just being present in the scene
On the wall, there was a picture that looked familiar
And when he got close, his heart stopped
cause he saw it was a painting of his dream
It was a painting of his dream
His body on a runway
By a ladder to an airplane with its propellers spinning
Which accounted for the loud noise
The match up was perfect
And that was the day he stopped believing in existing
He resented his creator
I mean, words can't explain
What must have went on in his brain while he stared into a frame
Of a work of art which he created and was at the same time
The mind can't handle that much, it's just insane
It's like reading a book where each words describe your thoughts
And in quotations, it reads whatever you say when you talk
You think it can't happen
But it did happen
I guess there's surprisingly wide cracks in each life's sidewalk
He stumbled upon an answer when he never had a question
And decided to stop dreaming to maintain his mental health
Now he hardly talks to people
Just stays in his basement
Writing infinity, by painting himself
Painting himself
This is a strange universe
Is it all just a blueprint?
In the real universe, is my consciousness useless?
Are we really something a higher intelligence made up?
A figment of imagination colored by a cosmic paintbrush?
Maybe all of our art creates the fate of other beings
Then every character in ever novel thinks it's alive and were just gods
Ruling blindly
Just a theory
I don't know what it means
But that's the story of the man who trained himself not to dream",Hip-Hop
"Albert was a man
Took kids by the hand
He had too much fun
He touched their little bums
He lit fires up his ass
Made him cum real fast
He tried to eat his shit
That came from his pit
He did chow it down
He never wore a frown
Spank
Wank
Yeah
Cum splattered corpse
Use a knife and fork
Stinky mouldy flesh
Is what I like best
Spank
Wank

Slicing penile meat
Rotting flesh I eat
Pumping body chunks

"I'm really not all that sure

So let me find me a nigga with a grip
and hit his ass quick with one of them whoops

Taking a niggaz shit

Now the town is funky, it's called survival
What y'all wanna do? They got us scuffled

I'm heated, them niggaz cheated, played me false
We had em eatin, shit 'posed to been squashed
I noticed one killa on the double dribble and set him up y'all
She likes the Monie in the Middle, play tetherball
Thick ass bitch, high yellow city-slicker
Scarecrow creepin Southern bitches, aka Posie Pussyfictious
Nigga been holdin guts, but shit on hisself and a funky bill
Pullin out bills, frontin on material shit

And settin 'im up and havin 'im catchin a couple of slugs
Sl-uh sl-uh slugs, trynta fuck with savage thug
Pistol pop in they ass, see niggaz be gettin this twisted
It's that bitch that killed ya
Took all your money peeled ya
Seven niggaz bust in the room with AK's
while a nigga be puttin on his jimmy
All of a sudden they shoot up your Vuitton
before you can hit the broccoli
See money-a-made that nigga, that nigga didn't make that money
Left them niggaz jacked up, and the bitch she macked him
He's a busta, punk ass nigga, y'all know the streets
That's why that nigga naked layin dead in between some bloody sheets
It's just a part of the game he didn't feel
Bitches will kill, fuck a nigga, out his last d-uh dollar bill

Droughts, out, shhh lost clientele but I will prevail
by sellin the broccoli dank instead of the crack cocaine

When these punk MC's and bitches be the reason why
the smoke be comin up out the chow, with my nigga Pac
Dear God, can you forgive me? My future's lookin sick
I'm in my rag hittin switches I'm suspicious of these bitches
I keep on, calllin, but ain't nobody pickin up
I think she's stallin, this evil bitch is tryin ta set me up
Came all alone if it's on then it's on
Where's my motherfuckin chrome, only jealous niggaz roam
It's a war zone  but I'm a man so with gun in hand
I'm on my way to see this hoe you know the fuckin plan
Can't understand, but the things ain't the same
You could die over these bitches if you slippin in the game
Niggaz gang bang, but bitches gang bang too
Give up that good thang, and put that pistol to your brain
If you was smart figure, don't have no love in your heart nigga
Any complications pull the trigger, dusted and disgusted
Bitches can't be trusted, you know the rules
They underhanded, she planned it, you fuckin fool

Hey be proud of it when you turn these bitches upside down
What's gonna happen



The California lifestyle that I live
Where the bitches is crooked and niggaz jus don't give
A flyin fuck, so I stay stuck, smokin on the tay-low
Bay Area playa, tryin ta have shit major
And a bitch won't save ya
so I ain't playin Captain Save a Hoe
I mob up in ya like a pro and then I'm gone
I'm like Sylvester Stallone, everyday is like a Cliffhanger
Action packed, I let the mini-mac smack that ass
Them hoes jacked that ass
Nigga woulda got smokin on that hash
Can't have my cash, better go and take your nigga stash
Cuz he's a busta, niggaz with clusters
Slippin in shit, betta jack that nigga 'fore I jack his ass bitch
Never was no love for the mark-ass, the lo pink 
You love them Bootsy bitches, can't let them pussy bitches
gank that ass, betta hide your cash and check her fast
Pump your brakes nigga, slow your roll don't go too fast
Cause bulletproof ain't doin no good no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'now, niggaz
comin up dead with they brains blew out on the fuckin floor
damn, hollow points to flesh tears through the teflon vest
Now r-uh-rest
Pull a plug on a flatline over those, one nigga less
One nigga less, from coast to coast, to the East to the West
Crushin the flesh, dem bitches played a game of death
Look over your shoulder watch your back don't even trust it

"Lyrics to In Boxes Calling out for the lonely, I'm going home
I've been doing awful things again,
I hear them laughing in my head
I went out in the morning, looking for a man
I could see you were the perfect one, standing alone
I've been walking ahead for a while
And dragging a body behind
My baby, I had a good time
My baby, I know you were mine
Got them all collected in these boxes underneath my bed, my bed
Uuh uh uh uuh
Uuh uh uh uuh
Here I am, still lonely with the souvenirs
I would kill for some company, temporally
I did once have a lover, only kept his hands
They can dance and play the songs for me,
Play until I sleep.

And dragging a body behind
My baby, I had a good time
Got them all collected in these boxes underneath my bed, my bed

Now bust this...
Aiyyo i think about this government, three strikes capital punishment
Enslaved my peoples for four hun-d-red
Yeah, plus some
Often dream of goin' back in time and givin' slaves guns 
So they can watch the master run
Watch them devil try to get away then clap his back with the shotgun
I got one, let's cut his head off
Let's take it to Harriet Tubman, show her that we ready to set it off
She get Nat turner, Nat go get Sojourner
Sojourner send a messenger for Touissant l'overture
Through the underground railroad, we go
Through the dark to the edge of forest to meet with Denmark
Vessey, you know he got soldiers ready
Ready to kill like lions, in the Serengeti
So like a stampede we rush the plantation
Settin' fire to everything, burn them down like cremation
No hesitation, free up the black nation
Kill them devils take his ships and head back for the mainland
The game plan, yet and still it's just a dream
I never forget, in my mind it never leave, aiyyo

I never forget, in my mind it never leave
These dreams, filled with days of slavery
Never forget, in my mind it never leave
These dreams, filled with days of slavery
Aiyyo, aiyyo Jamie was a slave
Every baby she'd have the master would take away
She never seen one long enough to give a name
Everytime the master would rape, Jamie'd feel ashamed
She was only fourteen
Violated, used and abused, far from a queen
I met Jamie in a dream
I gave her a brand new M-16 with two magazines
I told her next time he come around
Act like you want him, get him to lay down
Make sure that he take off his clothing
After that i want you to fill him up, full of bullet holes
Release the whole clip, set trip on that motherfucker
Tell him that's for disrespectin' you and your mother
Your grandmother, your great-grandmother
Your brother your father, in the land they call the mother
Next thing you do is round up all the rest
Stay together and shoot your way to freedom, god bless, aiyyo

Aiyyo, I got Dj Babu in the house
From the world famous, beat junkies
Aiyyo, yo Babs how you feel about this?
And this goes out to all the ancestors
Especially to my grandmother

I come home in the evening there's no laughter there to fill the air
A cool lonely room to meet me nobody here to greed me where has our love gone
And then my thoughts begin to stray back to a happy yesterday
When love was here beside me your love was here to guide me where did I go wrong
What is my reason for going on living when I'm not really living at all
I reach down for the paper and I see a toy our little boy
Left layin' there it haunts me I wonder if he ever wants me to play his little games
I guess I never took the time to fix a hurt or make a rhyme
Or carry him on my shoulder will he forgive me when he's older
Or will he remember my name
What is my reason for going on living when I'm not really living at all
I found a puppy down the street with big sad eyes and muddy feet
There's nobody here to claim him no wonder round here to name him
Or take him for a walk
I keep him here for company and he looks up so sad at me
Each time he sees me crying he knows inside I'm dying if only he could talk

Got a house note not rent.
Dual exhaust sound like a dog barking,
Cutlass Oldsmobile, Platinum Kush sparking.
At the intersection making hella noise,
Cock-eyed bass like Barry White voice.
Underneath my seat...HEAT,
4 G auto slippers on my feet.
Hit the liquor store for some alcohol,
Earl Stevens wine and some Buzzballz.
Walking out the door I see a super thick,
Orange bone thicker than my other chick.
Every day I celebrate life,
You only live once, not twice.
Put the good lord first, not second,
That's the only way you're gonna get to heaven.
Breathing is a blessing every time I wake up,
When I'm at the barbershop, I got my pistol tucked.
Ready for whatever, just in case,
I gotta put a sucker in his place.
In the thick with the worms and the maggots,
My pinky ring got a bunch of baguettes.
Standing on the couch in the club,
Like the homie Pac say...Give me LOVE!!!

I want your LOVE...I want your LOVE,
Like the homie Pac say...Give me LOVE!!!


Everything on me brand new,
First thing people look at is ya shoe.
Bosses everywhere in my crew,
We hella deep...deep like the Wu.
Worry about your own paper route,
Mess around and stretch yourself out.
Groveling and complaining... hella grumpy,
Trying to count the next player money.
I can see right through a sucka like a vodka bottle,
Trying to stack paper... taller than a supermodel.
I am on this Mango-scato,
It go hella hard, not soft like a soft taco.
It's the weekend, and even if it ain't,
We gonna paint the town and put some paint where it ain't.
At the store, I gig like a gangster,
Just to let you know, keep one in the chamber.

I want your LOVE,
I want... your LOVE.
Give me LOVE!!!

Raised in the gravel...brought up on the tar.
Word played like scrabble...microwave pickle jar.
In the middle of the ghetto, might slap box spar.
Used to step on a crack, but I wasn't superstitious,
Now they got cameras, and face recognition.
Gotta be careful on the street,
Helicopters can see through body heat.
I'm sitting on the couch smoking a bowl,
Slapping classics that touch the soul.
Watch what you say to ya heathen,
Never know when you might need um.
Be a father to ya son or ya daughter,
Be a man, not a damn coward.
Might be a judge or rap or play sports,
Attend they games, pay your child support.
Most gifted people on this earth, can be right in your presence,
Diamond in the rough, by their selves.
Back of the bus...by choice not force
Real once cuz, embrace, endorse.
I love people...not things,
That's probably why I always see snakes in my dreams.
When you see my family...give them a hug,
Tell them all I ever wanted was they LOVE.
I want your LOVE,
I want... your LOVE.
Tell them all I ever wanted was they LOVE...Give me LOVE!!!

I want your LOVE,
I want... your LOVE.

"I've just been to heaven with someone so true I dreamed about mama last night
She read me her Bible like she used to do I dreamed about mama last night
Mama used to never go to sleep at night until all of us were in bed
On party nights till we come home she often sat up and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when children were away
We only knew that she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we were all gonna come home alright
Why sometimes we'd stayed away till one or two or three
And I used to think that mama could hear the turning of the key
For we'd step aside and she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand just why
But up until the last one had returned mama always kept a light
She couldn't go to sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
I think mama just had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
She seemed to fear that the world might harm the ones that she loved the best
One time she told me when you're grown to women and to men
I'll sleep the whole night through I bet I'll be different then
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
Then always when we got back home we'd find her waiting there
And then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said
And in her eyes there gleamed again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know that we were all alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years then mama went to sleep
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep I dreamed about mama last night",Country
"This human incompetence and it's consequence,
Sub-human intolerance hitting home. This stupid, old
Prejudice and it's consequence; civilian rights are
Not right for ALL deserve rights, large and
Small.
Rise and Fall... each breath could be
The last-chances have all come and passed.
Why can't we just shake the urge to end
Everything? Property lines slise through the
Earth. The sadden urge to control our surroundings;
Money and time now define the WORTHless we rise and we fall.
Rise and Fall... each breath could be
The last-chances have all come and passed.
Fighting for land to own... and man will
Always find reasons for war. Fighting wars yields
Bitter rewards so let's contemplate what to fight
For.
From the oceans we rise... to the ashes
We fall. All for one... not one for all.
Where do we go when we no longer
Exist? Apologies are useless, they're nothing,
They're important. To savour the taste of youth
And sweet control... Hierarchal classes
Split the masses - pray your ranking's high.
Off - white, low - life, nuisance in a flawless
Life, ground underfoot like ashes. The world's
A fucking gas chamber.

"You made me feel like a hat stand
All tall, grim and brown
You made me feel like a clothes horse
Old and left out in the rain
You sure say you can
But also I shared you with the others
I couldn't stand it
You made me feel like a deserted house
Dark and empty in the dusk
You made me feel like a charred foot
In a burnt out factory
You insist that I split
Cast me into the pit with the others
So many of them down there
Now it's so dark, dark, dark
Not a tiny spot of hope for me
Though I want you so much
That I need a crutch by the time you set me free
Now it's so dark, dark, dark
Not a tiny spot of hope for me
Though I want you so much
That I need a crutch by the time you set me free
You make me feel like a broken yellow yo-yo
Thrown away on a dump
You made me feel like a flower
Makin' way for a petrol pump
You ruined my days
With your poisoned ways
Like you did the others
So many others
Wonderin' down here
Hello man, how are things now?
Dark isn't it?
What a woman!
Wonder when she'll let us out?",Rock

lies the Ocean of Impurity
a ship made of angels' hair

I watch myself in the boiling sea
so if you are a man
prepare yourself for joining me

"On the shadows line where whispers creep
From the world above to the world beneath
On waves of silver I dreamed of gold
And rang the mark where my shadow fall
Take away this illusion, hide all the lies
Show no more fear - rise with the tide
Dreamed I sailed to the mirrored edge that dragged me down to my ocean bed
And a silent shore waits with silver sand
Divide the sun, reveal my desire
Take away this illusion, hide all the lies
Show no more fear, rise with the tide
With beauty before me, beauty behind
The sun in the morning is the beauty I find
Where sky land and water reveals together
I lay my body down, in the ocean forever
The seaweeds in the ocean shall be my deathbed
Untie my hands and let my spirit free
Should I die to forgive
As colors fly
Try not to live
And paint my skin
Be with me here
To wake me up
At the ocean we are free
It stops the time
She cast her fair body, and long blond hair
And closed her hands around me
In our ocean bed
I'm caught up in this wet web she's spun
As eyes of the ocean watch our secret vow
The seaweeds in the ocean shall be my deathbed
A silent ocean line
Awaits with silver sand",Metal

To fight this woe is me demeanor

We all learn to survive

I said don't look now
Cause here we are
Living the best days of our lives
These are the best days of our lives

My nights with strangers and their lovers
I notice happiness depends
On if we share it with each other
So when this craziness is through
I'll spend my happiness with you

Living the best days of our lives

"All I heard was the sound of fish who'd drowned.
All I saw was the inside of my eyelids.
All I said fell short of reaching open ears.
Word's floating, clouding the view...
""See no, hear no, speak no evil"" leave you deaf, dumb and blind, because the bad is all that you'll find.
A deeply heart-felt goodbye to the part of me that dies when I decided to put others before me, yes, my heart fell asleep -- boredom and fatigue.
I always said I wanted to die smiling, to pretend I'm at peave.
Now from my corpse beams a frigid, blank grin and once hopeful eyes are sunken in.
Like a lullaby to the cradle is the eulogy to the casket.
All my flaws swept under the table to grieve the porcelain doll that was me.
Their solemn songs sang me to sleep as my body escaped me.
Welcome down to the new world!
Happiness is being interred!
Such a shameful masquerade!
Fleeting, frozen minutes on display.
Why is evolution such a shameful thing to say?
Can you feel your bodily decay?
Arms are beside me, hands open wide.
Seems I was living my life in rewind, taking so many steps backwards, not looking behind.
Because I can sure as hell feel my brain going blank.
If my body betrays me, this pollution to thank.
This condition infects my cells like it controls my mind.
Internal army, defend me behind enemy lines!
Fragile vehicle of mine!
Don't abandon me yet!
There is so much to live for that we so easily forget.
Fascination with the fear...
The concept escapes me.
All encompassing fate... how it wrenches out hearts, torments our souls ans sings us all to sleep, to an eternal keep, no matter what beliefs, it sings us all...",Metal

She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed

Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

Man, this ho you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her

Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six

It's ok I know nothing's wrong, nothing
Hi yo I got plenty of time
Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight
Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home she lifted up her wings
Guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time, before we were born
If someone asks, this where I'll be, where I'll be
Hi yo we drift in and out
Hi yo sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead

"Love took a long time, it followed me here
And it landed on light feet, and it whispered in my ear
Love spoke of my past as a valuable test
And smiled, and said she who loves last loves best
'Cause you know life is hard, but now you also know your mind
So now you're going out to love, but on your own side this time
Where you still think of famine, and you still dig up train fare
And you won't mind the wrinkles, 'cause you know how they got there
In love but not at peace, in love but not at peace
Once for me, love was the boat inside of a bottle, it felt like a gondola ride
When you float with the nicknack's, and you don't hear a sound
Where the fish never lived, and you don't miss the ground
Then the moon hangs above like a Valium pill
And I say I'll be fine, but I don't think that I will
But today I got work, and I like it that way
It's a case of a still life gone cine a verit
In love but not at peace, in love but not at peace
And I still need the beauty of words sung and spoken
And I live with the fear that my spirit will be broken
And that's the way I thought it would be
That's the way I always wanted it to be
So I'll keep you wondering what time I'm arriving
You drive me crazy with your backseat driving
And I'll talk in my sleep and you'll steal all the covers
We'll argue it out and we'll call ourselves lovers
And I'll stay in my body and you'll stay in your own
'Cause we know that we're born and we're dying alone
So turn out the light while the sirens are screaming
And we kiss for the waking, and then join the dreaming
In love, but not at peace, in love, but not at peace",Indie

I lose control in here
My self control is coming down

My self control is going down

Sometimes reality is killing you without a sound

I lose control in here

Slightly fade away
My self control is going down

Mind struggling in my fight
My mind struggles every night since you're gone
I feel so helpless now
I try to catch it somehow
All you ever leave behind are memories to find
Breakdown my agony
Mastering my self control
So I'll breakdown my agony
Searching for my self control
Inside my head it's kinda weird

It'll make us feel alive.
Cuz I won't sit and wait,
For the day you change your mind.
I've got your sleeve still pinned to my heart,
and I'm starting to see that it's a problem.

These days I wanna cut my tongue out of my mouth,
cuz thoughts keep slipping out in the worst situations.
Maybe, let's fall apart,
start a riot, place it in our hearts.

crash down around me.

"Tossing and turning the whole night long
My girl is gone, can't take it
Trying to conceal the loneliness I feel
But it's real, can't fake it
Listen to me
This pain in my heart is tearing me apart
A memory, I can't shake it
I try to tell myself to find somebody else
But my heart won't make it

I need love, that's a natural fact
And more than anything
I want my baby back
I want her right here with me
let me tell you now
She's the only girl that can brighten up my world
What can I say to make her do it?
She's fine as can be and so good to me
I had a good thing, but I blew it
oh, now I'm all alone
The love we had is gone
What can I do to renew it?
If I only had a chance to continue our romance
I wouldn't hesitate to get to it

Come on, come and see about me

I ain't seen her no where
I been searching everywhere
I, I want my baby back
Give anything in this world
To get back that girl
I tell you, I need her
Need her, need her
Need her right now, ah yeah",R&B

Don't count the diamonds in her wedding band until she wears it on her hand

I guess I'll just pack it in
Wanna wash away my sins
In the presence of my friends
You and I, we head back east
To find a town where we can live
Even in the half light
We can see that something's gotta give
When we watched the markets crash
The promises we made were torn
And my parents sent for me
From out west where I was born
Some people say
We've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost for what we've lost
Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life
Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild, woo!
Though we knew this day would come
Still it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born
I now see through a dead man's eyes
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.

Painting me in shades of clay
Covering me whole
And I'm a lizard, sunbathing in your radiance
Oh i come out of hiding, so sweet
so sweet you are
If I could only have a taste
Wrap my lips around your flavor
Just because you are you
Just because you are, so beautiful

Bringing light into the day

Casting shadows
On all my dismal yesterdays
Do you remember that you told me, darling
That I was so real
I tell you all, my tears for you are real
And we'll cross that bridge again some day
I know we will
I hope we will
Desert sunset, a lullaby
If I could give it all to you
If you'd only let me try
Sing so sweetly, it's my only wish

Desert moonrise, into the night
Before we lay our heads
I wish to walk under the splendorous starlight

And I drop down and kiss the ground
And all my cares lie far below

In this hearth my fire grows",Indie

""Hey man, heard you get the job done!""

Know I'm being antagonized by what you can't hear
And just moving with the current
Current state of self embalment
Where I don't involve myself in human affairs
Just leave me an address on where I live
I'll make it slow and painful
I don't ask for much

A few bills, and the occasional, occasional, occasional human touch

Drink to take the edge off
I told you that I'd bring you my head
I told you I was better off dead
Have you heard the kind of shit that I've said?
Cause I'm a mad, mad man, no, I'm not a mad man.
I told you if you slipped me a drink...
I told you not to speak when I'm thinking
I told you I was having a hard time sleeping
I'm a sad, sad man, yeah I'm a real sad man!

And empty glasses

And his lip would reach the pavement.

And tell her that you love her,
Take her in your arms
And hold that woman tight.
Won't you take her in your arms
And tell her that you love her.

Then be sure you do it right.""

wird nicht ausgeschlossen, daß es sich
hierbei um ein Verbrechen handelt.

Faggot ass niggas 
Yo, they done shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll em over take that fellas pellet
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even puff, and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm sayin this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
And I'm tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down, before I make change
Yo the sale went stale, caught em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man inditement, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know, I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know, I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an o.z.
My man brought em to me, see he ain't really know b
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just tryin to pop, to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him o.z.'s, then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-de's, damn man I O.D.
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holdin the heat
Po-Po walking to beat, we burnin l's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over I can't believe it, damn it's over
Fed's ceased the six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rollin in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
380-6 shot glock top load-up
Keep it in my waist son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long

"If I could divide the smell of flowers
Id send some to the falsely charged
Locked in prison cells
Send some to the lonely seniors
Trapped in apartment hells
Send some to the weary miners
Sweating beneath the ground
Send some to the invisible people
Hauling our garbage round
Some answers in life are so easy
Like zero plus zero is none
But how do we divide the smell of flowers
So their fragrance is shared by everyone?
If I could divide the smell of flowers
Id pass some to the frightened animals
Caged against their wills
Pass some to the dying birds
Choking on oil spills
Pass some to the angry kids
Sniffing up airplane glue
Pass some to the crying widow
Missing the Love she knew
Some answers in life are so easy
Like zero plus zero is none
But how do we divide the smell of flowers
So their fragance is shared by everyone?
If I could divide the smell of flowers
Then youd always have your share
If I could divide the smell of flowers

"In pursuit of Clarividence to live is to sleep
To die is to awake in the twilight of the fears
Those countless melodies of hate
In the oceans of fresh sadness
The sound of the other side
Is the mirror of my grave's face
But I have pride and force
My heart is the fire of hope
The anger will make me Immortal
For me to die is to awake
Ecstasy in the nocturnal winds
Light and visions of grey faces
Vortex of innocence and desire
No beauty nor happiness
Vortex of innocence and desire...
Show me the memories, Honoris lux infinitus
I want to be forsaken under my forgotten lands
Hear the whispers of the moon
Forever my will is strong and my hate is everlasting
My bride is the majesty, she comes in the

What might drop you in the dirt
You've got a special arrow just to shoot at me
That's so gangsta and so true
Whatever happens here will naver make a change
You can feel it in the air
It's just the card that was dealt to me
Can't leave it unrevenged
Arrest me now before you get to change your mind
I always wanted it that way
If there's a way to stop before it's too late
Please let me know what that is
Whatever it is it makes me want to set things straight
Make it better make it right

Giving in, like I'm staring at the sun
I'm burning up, cause you say that you love
Me, but I know there's a life I'm giving up

In another life, like mayflies, we'll take over the sky
In another world, away from here

I don't wanna talk about it, afraid of what I'm gonna do
I don't wanna let your light in, I've got enough to lose
I don't wanna say it's something, afraid I'm gonna make it true
We'll be lying in the pieces, I've got enough to lose

Still awake
Nothing seems to shine
For better days
What will we leave behind?
You're making me choose, but I can't lie
Maybe we're a love for another time

"Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one
Look towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain
Soul is searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas,
Torture in the winter skies,
Riding over plains of ice,
Shadows in the fields of the slain!
Crashing steel and raging fury
Smash the glass destroy the army
Crush the legions of the twilight
Give us our steel on the way
Cry far away as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the war as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes
We'll never see our world
Far away and ever onwards see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
With tonight, woah, woah?
Watch you die, I watch you die inside
While fate controls your life
And reject this animosity
That's piercing every mind
You feel the power, do believe
The fear you hold inside
Choose to find a reason for the treason
Now you will be mine
Screams of pain are not the same
And rise again from hell, defending
Power of hearts within the fire
Warriors of hell fear the slain
Rise through the pain
And the sun will rise again,
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
Riding on the wings of hell
The innocence of our souls
Far away and ever onwards see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
With tonight, woah, woah?
Far away and ever onwards see the day

Llamando a la mujer acciÃ³n
Si tu tampoco tienes perro que te ladre

Entonces quÃ©, nos vemos a las nueve en punto
Miras el reloj, faltan diez y piensas, me da tempo
Ducha y secador, maquillaje, ropa y pensamientos
Y contestas los emails
Reloj, es la tercera vez que te consulto
No quiero retrasarme en el tumulto

Y salgo sin atarme los cordones
Salir no es que importe

Las calles viniendo
ApÃ¡rtate, tarde
Quitando gente de en medio
Pasaron las nueve, las diez ya se fueron

"There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds
As to this verdant country they came from all around
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall
Built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us all
And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay
For they looked in the future and what did they see
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land
All up through the seaports and into their hands
Look away said they across this mighty land
From the eastern shore to the western strand
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We're gonna lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away
We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done
We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done
So over the mountains and over the plains
Into the muskeg and into the rain
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town
A dollar a day and a place for my head
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead
Oh the song of the future has been sung
All the battles have been won
O'er the mountain tops we stand
All the world at our command
We have opened up the soil
With our teardrops and our toil
For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
And many are the dead men too silent to be real",Folk

And there were tears in her eyes and she whispered with a sigh
Stranger please take me out of here
But it was only commercial affection cause a fool and his money will part

Could've been anything in life and yet I'm out here on tour
Like some day we gonna get bored and we gon' want more
Pretty much prepping myself
For the fans that finna get ahead of they self
When they act like they know everything about me
And all the niggas that doubt me
Come outta nowhere and start criticizing all proudly
Like ""hold on nigga, where the fuck was ya'll at?""
Buggin out on me, nigga fuckin' now, homie
Some days I can feel Hopsin's energy rubbin' off on me
Cause the love don't feel real if the talent is only a skill
It's unrealistic to think that one day we won't make a mistake
But who am I to say, it's probably from never taking a break
Finding pleasure in poetry, guitar strings and a bass
Uh, my life ain't been the same while on the run
When these kids say ""fuck a message, we just wanna have fun""
Now I move to the beat that confused me for weeks
While ya'll hands high, my head high like hold on nigga you lost me

I see exactly how ya'll do ya'll favourite rappers
Favorite musicians, athletes, actress, actors
Spreading anything without it being the truth
I guess to tarnish someones image these days is the thing to do
But when you stop judging the music
And you decide you wanna judge me on the way I live my life
Cause I'm a celebrity and you can
Don't be surprised if my response to the negative shit
Is telling you to ""suck my dick""

When love was something else
She combs her hair then quietly fluffs her pillow
As she lays down, she turns off the light
She collects her thoughts and listens to the silence

Then I squish your wish you're all fuckin dreamers 
No time for tiddlywinks - if your titties is pink
then you are white and I'm not the right man 
But you can blow pipe, my style is so tight
I be carvin, MC's when I'm starvin 
You little chunks of punks that I dunks in my coffee
Get off me, I'm not your softie
But you will cough for your breath and phlegm, death to them
And silly broads, I fuck 'em and I chuck 'em 
In the river, without a liver
And I donate to science, cause I'm a giver
The mysterious clearly busts brains with my brawn
Ask Sean, Cassidy about how I trash MC's
On the daily, Alex Haley had to write about it
Doubt it but it's true, get a clue 
I'm tellin you the truth you'll be toothless
The boots get smoked like they on fire, I desire
Like Salt'N'Pepa, I'll fuck a fat heffer 
like I was Fritz the Cat, and she admits to fat
So I'm movin removin wackness from my stratosphere
If I thought that that was near

""You still bet that you can harm me, but you don't alarm me..""

Listen to this
You're just a test tube baby, you can't fade me, but hey G
Your style is lazy, boy you're crazy
Losin it, check out my fusion kit 
It's welding rhymes and propelling, swelling 
Getting bigger, getting niggaz in headlocks
Instead lock your scanners on Bruce Banner
I crush fools plus tunes used by the master
will blast you into Tuesday, when I bruise a
motherfucker, who mother suck a cock
and his brother fuck a jock, and his sister, got blisters
on her lips that be spreadin, she be-headin 
Showin cleavage, with my futuristic styles I leave kids
in a trance, hypnotizin your eyes spin
back in your head like you dead but instead you was buggin
Ugly bitches get the dillz after shows 
Cause I don't be runnin after hoes that be stank
I thank the Lord, for my thought
connected to the microphone, so check the cycle tone
that I be arousin, housin your blouse and your pumps
The mac daddy makes you jump! 
I pump info, into nymphos, who be bonin
Clonin, Vanessa Del Rio
And yes sir Del see no evil, hear no evil
It's normal, I come formal, to keep 'em warm 'til the morn'

"She just left the point at Kittanning
The train number 1262
And on down the mountain she travelled
So brave with her men in her crew
And the engineer pulled at the whistle
For the brakes didn't work when applied
And the brakeman climbed out on the car top
For he knew what that whistle have cried
With all of the strength that God gave him
He tightened those brakes with a prayer
But the train went right on down that mountain
Her whistle still piercing the air
She travelled that sixty an hour
Gaining speed every foot of the way
And than with a crash it was over
And there on the track the freight lay
Now it's not the amount of the damage
Or the value of what that rail cost
It's the sad scene they found in the cabin
Where the life of two brave men was lost
They found them at their post in the wreckage
Where they died when the engine had fell
The engineer still held the whistle
And the fireman still hung to the bell
Here the story is told of the freight train
But it should be a warning for all
We need to be prepared every moment
For we can never tell when he calls",Country

As she sings so low for the congregation
In her mind she's at the Opry and her friends filled the pews

Looking in Nashville mirrors it's easy to see the reflection of the star

He hates to leave his family but his dream won't let him quit
In a honky tonk in Georgia she looks old at sixteen
Lord she hates the spotlights she don't even like the scene
But daddy's pushin' her to be the star he can't be
Those lyin' Nashville mirrors there's so easy to believe
Looking in Nashville mirrors...
Excepting his award on the Grammy show tonight
That cowboy's now an outlaw stoned out of his mind
He's found that a star only lights an empty space
And the mirrors that he dreamed in he can't find the nerve to face
Looking in Nashville mirrors...

Life ain't forever and lunch isn't free
Loved ones will break your heart with or without you
Turns out we don't get to know everything
Get the young scientists, tell them come quick
I must be the first man that's ever seen this
Lines on my face, my teeth are not white
My eyes do not work and my legs don't move right

Taken but shaken, unprepared
Under the balcony, under the trees
Fully unknowing of where this would lead
What if we marry or give up the ghost?
Or we abandon those we love most?
What if you carry me and lay me down
Once you get used to me being around?

"Oliver Paul, twenty years old
Thick head of hair worries he's going bald
Wakes up at a quarter past nine
Fare evades his way down the 96 tram line
Breakfast on the run again
He's well aware he's dropping soy
Linseed Vegemite crumbs everywhere
Feeling sick at the sight of his computer
He dodges his way through the Swanston commuters
Rips off his tie, hands it to a homeless man
Sleeping in the corner of a Metro bus stand
He screams ""I'm not going to work today!
Gonna count the minutes that the trains run late
Sit on the grass building pyramids out of Coke cans""
Headphone wielding to the Nicholas Building
He trips on a pothole that's not been filled in
He waits for an elevator, 1 to 9
A lady walks in and waits by his side
Her heels are high and her bag is snakeskin
Hair pulled so tight you can see her skeleton
Vickers perfume on her breath
A tortoise-shell necklace between her breasts
She looks him up and down with a Botox frown
He's well used to that look by now
The elevator dings, and they awkwardly step in
Their fingers touch on the rooftop button...
""Don't jump little boy, don't jump off that roof
You've got your whole life ahead of you
You're still in your youth
I'd give anything to have skin like you!""
He said, ""I think you're projecting
The way that you're feeling
I'm not suicidal just idling insignificantly
I come up here, for perception and clarity
I like to imagine I'm playing Sim City
All the people look like ants from up here
And the wind's the only traffic you can hear""
He said, ""All I ever wanted to be was an
Elevator Operator can you help me please?!""

Down-da-down, check it, check it
There was a Hardy Boy mystery I was trying to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My guy came to grab me in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart knelt
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came in during the day when at work they was found
At the mound I stand vocal pitch high, asking who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go Wild Hundreds
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill, and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kicking what shit was left all around the house
Thinking whoever came in on me is out
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, yes it is

"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad",Pop

I want to get high on something

Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind

And I'm breaking at the britches

"I used to kick it with a brother named, Moe
Moe used to kick it with a brother named, Joe
Joe used to kick it with his girlfriend Lateisha
Whose brother Elmo, looked like me
Elmo used to elbow lots of brothers in the nose
Kick em when they down and he'd steal they shoes and clothes
Elmo would develop lots of beef as a tweaker
And all of them was mostly come lookin for me
Imagine that, fat motherfuckers with bats tryin
To rat pack, hmm, time to get a gat
So I'm strapped cause I'm trapped like brother Thomas in his fat
Momma's lap, what's happenin here's a rap
Saturday twelve o'clock, told E-Roc, the whole block
And what not, about, how men are spottin he said
""This little homey gets bread like flossin
You ain't Steve Austin, Elmo got paws in Boots
Maybe you should move to Boston""
But you get lost when you play like a punk
Pile on the Right Guard I got SERIOUS funk
""I'm trying, not to lose...""
""I'm trying, not to lose my head...""
""I plan to tell you what it is later""
Bet George and Bootsy, never had funk like this
Catch twenty-two, twist no fist can dismiss this
Rip that I'ma go through, maybe I can flow through
This whole ordeal and not pull out the black steel
And my friends make suggestions...
That I should squeal to the cops but that's out of the question
If I die by the trigger of a misled brother
Could he be judged by the system that is scared of me and others?
I believe no, so I don't go, with the flow
Even though I'm bout to roll with no paddle
Up a creek called shit, light is lit on the situation
Cause me and him is gonna decrease the population
Now we wonder why our revolution never grow
Killin motherfuckers just for steppin on our toe
If we had as much funk for our oppressors as we did
For ourselves, the blood would never flow again
And then, the uzis that were once used to kill each other
Could be used, to serve and protect the brothers
And the sisters and the cousins or whatever others
But the funk keeps growing like a fungus...
""I'm trying, not to lose...""
""I'm trying, not to lose my head...""
""That's Elmo, get that fool"" ""Yeah get that fool""
""Ay, I'm Boots, I ain't Elmo -- I'm Boots from The Coup!!""
Four years til I'm twenty-five, now I got a forty-five
Caliber don't take no jive, just pull to fix
Don't want to be eighty-sixed, three six and six ain't in my mix
Don't flap your lips about me takin no, trips
You won't be takin no sips from a milk carton
Seein my face with a caption, askin
""Have you seen Boots, he's missing in action""
This shit is more Off the Wall than Michael Jackson
Cause brothers who be doin brothers who be doin others
Screwin brothers but The Coup be doin more than shoo-be-doin
On the corner, talkin revolution from Victoria to Florida
It's why it don't make sense that they want me a goner
On a, run cause some brothers in a ratpack think I'm
Poppin junk cause they don't see for centuries
The genocidal funk so I'm a punk if I don't blast they ass
But I gots more funk for the rulin class
Will it ever end, will we ever win, drinkin juice and gin
Five-oh gets again, gets off with a grin
National Guard sent in for when we got beef
You want to pop the trunk we got serious funk
""I'm trying, not to lose...""
""I'm trying, not to lose my head...""
Aight, back it up
I want to say whassup to the brothers and sisters that really got my back
When the funk be on
Of course it goes without saying, that E-Roc and DJO from The Coup
Got my back at all times and at all costs
Same goes for D-Force and Sneaker, Point Blank
J-Post and Stone of the Outcasts
Osajih Po from the Tenth Planets
Chuck Da Pharaoh got my back
Evo got my back, Rose got my back
Niko and the whole Mau Mau Rhythm Collective
Got my back cause I got theirs
The funk is on, and African Identity is there
The funk is on and Midnight Voices is there
The funk is on and T-More and Twin from Elements of Change are there
And I'm there for Cindy, I'm there for 3rd Rail
I'm there for Aztlan Nation
I got your back Leftside Sim
I got your back Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy cause you got mine

Problem Child got my back with the piano

And you'd come running over, cry on my shoulder
Sometimes I'd get to hold you all night
There in my arms you'd lay soft and warm
You never felt the writing on the wall
You never knew how I wanted you
I was the boy next door, that's all
Just the boy next door, that's all

I never got to hold you again

Take orders, but always the spirit holds

She waits for the hours and hours to pass

Tonight its goin' down
Its time to get it on
Tonight will be the night of all the nights, tonight tonight

I'm gonna make you call my name

Got the candlelight and its glowing
Got you right now and I got you glowing

"Disappear from your home town
Go and find the people that you know
Show them all of your good parts
Beat down when the bad ones start to show
Going with a woman
A pretty girl that you never met
Make sure she knows you love her well
But don't make any other promises
The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town 'cause
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
When you run make sure you run
To something and not away from 'cause
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you anywhere
I once heard the worse thing a man can do is draw a hungry crowd
Tell everyone his name in pride and confidence
But leaving out his doubts
I'm not sure I bought those words
When I was young I knew most everything
These words have never meant as much to anyone
As they now mean to me
The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town 'cause
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
When you run make sure you run
To something and not away from 'cause
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you down
The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town 'cause
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
So when you run make sure you run
To something and not away from 'cause
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you anywhere
The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town 'cause
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
So when you run make sure you run
To something and not away from 'cause

The flowers climb through the snow
The willows weep and the clover bloom

And every friend has a stranger's face
Then deep within the dungeon cell
You have to make a choice

You know you called me last week
I got your message but I was outta state, yaknowhatI'msayin?

It seems you need a little bit of excitement in your life

I'm here for you, don't sweat it

How your man be treatin you?

I know

See you can call me any hour, that's how we do it
I'm in and out, and partner you ain't knowin this
She loves you dearly but she's all on a player's tip
Cause you ain't givin' somethin that she really needs
And that's that good ass lovin, partner can't you see
She's bored no trust, she sits in the house all day
While you out there ballin, tryin to have it the kingpin way
She gets no time, your schedule way too deep
You leaves out the house everytime you get a beep
To all you ladies, sweet dark and lovely
See players like me, I likes to taste the Easter bunny
I likes to lick you down, give you self esteem
I'm the playboy you want, on your under team
Yo' huckleberry, mackin fast Shot-ty
One of them type of ballers on the same level as Gotti
So all you tenders, it's all to the good
So page me on the under and I'll creep through yo' hood

If you need some lovin, lovin girl
I'll be yo' huckleberry, berry
And if you need someone to talk to girl, talk to girl
You can call me on the under, under

Lookin at my oyster perpetual Rolex, browsin through my Rolodex
Baby done left a verbal, want me to hit that girdle
Come through on a tuck, while he's in the shower
Get it when he's with Rob and 'em, after hours
Slumpin Johnnie Taylor, regulatin
Cheatin in next room, fornicatin'
Demonstratin, new and improved moves
Legislatin, Erk and drinkin booze
But when you plug it, baby see you soon
You say one day, we gon' jump the broom
It was seven years, and she was faithful for ya
But did she love ya, or was she used to ya
It ain't my fault you got too attached
But don't check me partner, check yo baitch
Wanna know my name, call me 40 Pop Cherry
I'll be yo huckleberry

I'm on yo mind, twenty-four seven
When you at work, you calls me at eleven
And that's cool, cause my number won't be on yo' bill
Ohh baby girl all we wanna do is keep it real
No hesitation, we wanna play this game right
But if you feel me, we gots to have our game tight
So we can mob to the beach and champagne and all
Rub you down to the camisole
One hundred miles away, while your man think you at work
That boy Shot, is all up in these skirts
If there's a bluebird on my shoulder should I hit it
I turn her around, then from the back that's when I hit it
But hittin it from the back ain't always what I wanna do
I got ta do you hard, so you can tell your crew

But to my dismay I've been lead astray
Cause you betrayed me

Your clothes are kinda different

I swear this is my last time
See I can't control her
I guess she's bipolar

But you didn't know nothing about that boo
Hold that thought I'ma throw you a clue
And maybe scream my point of view

Could put ours lives at stake

Floorboards covered in spinal fluids
Oozing liquid putresence

Your dreams have all crumbled to dust

But who's version of god should I trust

"I ride the psycho path in pain
Into the foreign shores
I'll never walk again
Just call my name and I will be your enemy
Just call my name and I won't be answering
I will be your enemy until the darkness fall
Blinded by the morning light
I'm not afraid to die
Eat my flesh and drink my soul
it's no use holding on
Feed my dreams with your own soil
Let me feel your pain
Come watch the acid sights I see
Crawling up towards me
The gods and demons serve me well
though I can't tell
Do they want me well?
I ride the psycho path to gain
The power that the sane never will obtain
Just call my name then I will be your enemy
Just call my name and I will be insane",Metal
"On a mission deliver the secret of kings
Watching the enemy lurking within
Reveal the plans that could take many lives
Danger will stalk every step that you take
Hide in shadow or they'll find you
One wrong step you have been seen
As you run your foes try and catch you
But you've been saved
By a light up ahead
By the light of 4000 torches
Reinforcements have come to defend
By the light of 4000 torches
A welcome sight for you has arrived
A melee ensues as you turn to fight
The odds are not hopeless you must survive
By luck you're given a chance to live on
Bare your teeth and kill for crown
Fight with heart before they strike you down
A scout you are a target for the kill
The keys you hold, allies will need them all
To stop a force coming to destroy
Through the fray the enemy seeks you out
But you must live for all could be lost
By the light of 4000 torches
Your countrymen will show you the way
By the light of 4000 torches
A turn of fate will carry you home

The day is won for you and your brothers
Many dead lie at your feet
Owe your life to those who fought with you
A victory worthy of song
By the light of 4000 torches
The blood that's spilled will not be yours
By the light of 4000 torches
The tables turned to favour your side
By the light of 4000 torches
You've been spared from meeting your end
By the light of 4000 torches

"So you got dumped on your rump
Not surprised you had nothing to say
To your friends the night before your birthday
But you got up and took control of the situation
Got it then he wants you back without an explanation
You change your style
You change your hair
Your jeans got tighter
Now people stare
He bites his hand and doesn't stop thinking about you
He asks a friend to ask you out now what do you do?
You know that he wants you but you don't want him anymore
This is this is this is a sticky situation 
Well you caught her in the act with 'a Brad' from your work station
You used a baseball bat and now it's into litigation
But you stood up cooled off and walked away despite your temper
Now she's calling you from January to December
You let it slide
You played it cool
And now she calls you
But you're no fool
She's not even worth the time but I think you know this
And she can have all the boys that are on the checklist
You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore
This is this is this is a sticky situation 

Woo
Don't get stuck!
It's that girl that you let go the one that doesn't get the picture
Because you left her right wanting to get back together
But you moved on found another and it leaves no question
She cries to her friends just to get attention
She puts you down
But you let her
You're feeling guilty
She's feeling better
But when she sees you
With another
She tears her heart out
You can't be bothered
This is this is this is a sticky situation 
You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore
This is this is this is a sticky situation !
You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore

Look like he stoppin for gas, I'mma pluck 'em, yay
This had to be his most, unlucky lucky day
Two brothers come out 7/11 in Army wear and stand there

So I just cash that, y'all probably think I'm buggin' but hey

Judge me, it's all designed

I'm surrounded by smiles
I watch my life accross a slide
I try to take control but I hide
Why can't I try?
What can I do?
What can I find?
Don't see your smile
What should I fight?
What should I fight?

and put it safe
but I count one two three
and I've lost them
I've lost you
what is true
what is false
what I've lost
what remains to me?
and I watch you go
without even knowin
What drives you to go
Why do you let me fall?
Why do you let me die?

takin another road

moon sitting in the night

I got it wrong
I regret

I take it off this way

Nothing's changed and nothing's evolved anywhere

Disarmed, defenseless

And everything has turned to gray

Into the deepest marsh I falling
And my struggling only helps
To force my suffocation

Your eyes were cold and dull
Why can't you stay with me forever
Why did you have to go
Oh, you were wilting much too fast
Your scars will never heal

Can I wake the dead
Can I cry if I could
Will the sun ever shine on you again

"David had an eagle tatooed on his right arm
He got it back in high school, when we were working on the farm
He's still got that arrowhead we found when we were kids
And I knew we would be like brothers, well just as long as we both lived
I still got my memories of the night we jumped the fence
Stole you uncle's pickup truck, drove it up around the bend
You were the handsome cowboy, I the trusty brave
We were looking for some fallen angel waiting to be saved
Well for some it just comes so easy
For others seems its bread in the bones
But we danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one we heard at home
I went to the mountains, I was reaching for the sun
I was on fire for leaving, this angry battle I thought I'd won
David dug his trenches, he fought his war at home
My mountain soon was crumbling, God I was all alone
Well for some it just comes so easy
And for others its bread in their bones
But I danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one I heard at home
It was years before the smoke cleared, I could come back home again
Look my father in the eyes, I could finally let him in
For he was not the enemy, no the enemy was within
And I knew the day they understood because David was my friend
Well for some you know it comes so easy
And for others seems its bread in their bones
But I still danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one I heard at home
I will always dance to the beat of a different drum
For the warrior has come home",Folk

Get up, get up, get up, get up, come on
Have me come for 
Get up, get up, get up, get up, come on 
Have me come for

One, two look at the tally they drew my picture with Bob Marley
They probably want to kill me will I die in 1999 smoking phillies
Bizzy the kid was bustin' in the ceilin' in my big claim
Kickin' on something and dig this
Got to feel it catch and don't let go
Wretched in a fro
Bone watching for the po, po
Roll over then pull it got my bullet in my fo, fo
I gotta stand it's turnin' to a jungle 
Comin' out a four door Benz and I spend a lot for show
No no don't spend a lot contend with a men
Lookin' at my watch like a meal ticket
Arrest the block they couldn't pin it better send it
For the cops absorb you soul of course
Praise to the Pharaoh
Murder Mo, Curly I heard it lower and return it burn
When our niggas still shermed out
Court's adjourned! Court's adjouned!
Rest and burn!

I can't sleep at night cause I lay in my bed
And I be tossing and turning trying to avoid my dreams
And I can hear the niggas letting off they lead around the corner
Got me feelin paranoia like they coming for me
And I be clutchin' my heat, got me pacing back and forth
So much shit on my mind, so many things to do
So little time a nigga really got to do it in
Man I be ready for war in my fatigues and boots
From the minute nigga step outside
Nina Ross on my hip and I got to pack one
Just like Little Eazy-E told you and me
Nigga never leave the house without packing a gun
And that's real leave it for the dollar bill
Niggas'll holler ""Kill Kill"" then start flexin'
When the shit poppin' off in my direction
Nigga got a 17-shot for protection
Life ain't no joke
Too many niggas I know was takin' shit for granted and that's foul
Nigga if you see a fool, pick a fool right out the crowd
And hit him dead in his mouth for being loud and wild
Shit is real
Ain't none of that elastic fagot rubber band plastic shit
Motherfuckers in the battle zone blasting shit
Put the match on shit straight up gassing shit

Hell yeah! It's that same nigga runnin' with the AK-47
Busting niggas in the belly
Give them motherfuckers more than just a headache
Get back at that nigga faster than FedEx
They're running retreating screaming Mayday we're going down
Now why the fuck is niggas telling lies and rumors?
Talking about we split up
Cause I see Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Niggas really need to shut that shit up
If a motherfucker really want to rumble we can tumble
We wilder than any animal that's in the jungle
The name of the game is block the basket, strike him out
Hit the goal make the quarterback fumble strategize
Any nigga hatin' ain't a friend of mine
Nigga considered the enemy niggas that's when you die
I never keep my enemies close
Cause I got a perfect view of 'em in my scope
That's close enough
Leather Face'll fuck a nigga up and smile
And hit 'em with the millimeter
And I show a bitch kill a nigga see me driving
Bitch come on and try to rob me
I'm willing to bet that 'cha get lit up
Get off of me baby ,
Keep on comin' and there's gon' be drama 
Telling you niggas you better not fuck with me
Cause I ain't that quiet nigga that I used to be
Look how the haters give a nigga attitude
Nigga sick of being humble now I'm like fuck that I gotta get mine
They try to show a nigga love, but fuck that it ain't no love
Cause in the game you get fucked every time
Got this feeling inside my bloodline
Somebody finna get fucked up! If a nigga don't get some satisfaction
Blastin' like a madman
Gettin' with the static nigga loving the action
Yeah My Bone Thug niggas come on
If any one of you niggas got any problems
Thinkin' you tough and you really want to solve 'em
Don't be mumbling speak a little louder
While you steady talkin' like you liver than the next nigga
We'll already be up in you now hater feel us
Who the realest The Bone Thug killas
If there's any objections niggas deal with 'em
Realer than them other motherfuckers talkin' about they thugs
Jumpin all on the bandwagon
Want to be like us, want to cuss, want to bust they guns
Thugged out with they pants sagging they actin'
But when it's really time to show some tactics
The niggas don't have 'em
We murdered the bastards, putting 'em all in bodybags and caskets
Drop 'em in the river, splash that's that ass
Cause when we clash ain't no coming back
Huntin' niggas from the past
We gon' settle this shit right here
Fight to whoever blood be spilled first
Who will be the nigga ridin' away in a Hearse?
Not me I'm determined to wake up and still be livin' in the morning you
Feeling me
Quicker than a clocked damn missile
Hit a bitch directly in the middle, right between your eye
Then we makin' sure that nigga die
Shoot a couple more times and ride out 
Nigga we ride out. 
Nigga we ride out. 
Nigga we ride out",Hip-Hop

And my tear drops are dry
With a warm glow inside

You told me you wanted me only
That this time and this love would last
You told me I'd never be lonely

"Nothing that's forced can ever be right
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it

And we bent our backs as slaves of the night
Then she lowered her guard and showed me the scars
She got from trying to fight
Saying oh, you'd better believe it.
Well I'm up to my neck in the crumbling wreckage
Of all that I wanted from life
When I looked for respect all I got was neglect
Though I swallowed the lign as a sign of the times
But dealing a jack from the back of the pack
They said-""You lose again""
Oh, I said, who needs it?
Well don't get me wrong now I tried to get on
With the jokers that got in my way
And I put on a smile and I tried all the while to be straight
But they just wanted more all the time and I'm sure
That you know what I mean when I say
That I'm sick of the touch and there's only so much you can take.
Well nothing that's real is ever for free
And you just have to pay for it sometime
She said it before, she said it to me
I suppose she believed there was nothing to see
But the same old four imaginary walls
She built for living inside
I said oh, you just can't meana it
Well there was never a doubt that she had to get out
she was just looking around for a way
In the pit of the night there was nowhere to hide any more
She was out on a limb, she was reaching for things
That she wanted, but just couldn't say
And she had to be sure that she wouldn't get caught like before.
Well nothing that's forced can ever be right
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it
That's what she said as she turned out the light

The veil that covered her eyes
I said oh, you can leave it.",Rock

You can see it all from the rooftops
a swollen vagina in the sky.
Threatening birth
three shades of blood to soak its bed.
One: fiery red for the shutdown of the science bled sun.
Two: viscous black for the sex lives of the science fed youth.
Three: milk white for the impossible vista of the skyline as it shorted out,
crackled with static and was replaced by a network of newsprint.

"Listen up and I'll tell you what you'll do
Forget about music and alcohol too
Forget about your baby
We got other work for you
Better drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to rise and shine
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for
It was back in 39
When I was one year old
Sitting by the backyard fence
And the world had turned so cold
Drink yer glasses empty now
Was all that they were told
Drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder
There's no time to wonder why
We'd love to take life over that is plain
Forget about sorrow, forget about pain
And watch a John Wayne movie
To remind us once again
Better drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the line
You got one less cause in the world
To be leaving for
Drink yer glasses girls and boys
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder
There's a tear in every eye
I'd like to take things one at a time
Forget about reason, forget about rhyme
Because beg, steal or borrow
You got another hill to climb
So drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the road
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for
Drink yer glasses girls and boys
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder
There's no time to wonder why
We'd like to take life over again
When time of war had passed away into the rain
And watch a John Wayne movie
To remind us of the plains
Just drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to rise and shine
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for
Listen up and I'll tell you what is true
They done some thinking and they changed a thing or two
You been living in the hindsight
Of a backwards point of view
So drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the road
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for",Folk
"Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe
I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside

He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black, maybe
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time

When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from, from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged, you get laughed at, you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us, black maybe

"A heavy rain is pouring down
Upon the mourners gathered at your grave
Heads bowed in deadly silence
As the priest recites your eulogy
Pounding nails into the lid of your coffin...
Pound
Casket slowly lowered into the ground
Another body consigned to the grave
Interned in your final resting place
Launched into eternity
Pounding nails into the lid of your coffin...
Pound
A bright light leads you to heaven
Your soul cursed to eternal damnation
Your spirit set free now wanders
Your body buried rots in the ground",Metal

My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water, holy water

Back when Michael Jordan was raw
'92 was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em
Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
Return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's
The you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4s
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin' on my car cause

Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission
Trynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her
And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain
Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide
Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies
Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!

"One single night, one single day
Before it all just sweeps away...
With the paradise I do not know,
Through the joy I never had
I'm all alone on my isolated throne
Why have you forsaken me?
The days outnumbered themselves into the grey
And life cries, a dream dies out into the blackness;
Stretches for an empty cup; a chalice to collect the tears
That I keep to myself
I gaze upon the mystery, this lovelorn identity...
Frozen beyond the echoes of laughter
This morphine cloud hanging over me
Like a snow-white curtain;
This beautiful haze overruns me
So I erase myself from you; the cure for my sanity...
And here I am, unwilling to forgive myself
So lost in this remedy, your spirit is haunting me;
consumed by indifference
I scream in your silence where shadows conceal me...
I'm cursed to search for you
Oh feeble, ungrateful heart;
Paralyzed you drown with me
Intoxicate this bitter reality
Under the screens of apathy
Oh feeble, ungrateful heart;
Paralyzed you drown with me
Intoxicate this bitter reality
Under the screens of apathy
The dream died before it was born,
Innocence is lost...And so am I
But still I pretend to be strong
Still I wonder where I belong
You whisper to me gently in my sleep
To this world behind
And I gaze upon the mystery, this lovelorn identity...
Frozen beyond the echoes of laughter",Metal
"His father was a man who could never understand
The shame on a red man's face
So they lived in the hills and they never came down
But to trade in the white man's place
It was early in the spring when the snow had disappeared
They came down with a bag of skins
In the fall of the year of 1910
Daddy died by the rope down in Cherokee Bend.
Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
There was blood on the floor of the government store
When the men took his daddy away
But the boy stayed back till he come to his end
And he run like the wind from Cherokee Bend.
Now the mother was alone and the winter was at hand
And she prayed to her spirit kin
It was warm in the lodge in the Kentucky hills
On the day when the boy came in
Then a blizzard came down and it covered up the door
Till they thought that it never would end
And he told her the tale of the terrible affair
In the government store down in Cherokee Bend
Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
For three long days and three long nights
They wept and they mourned and then
She returned to her work and her weavin'
And they tried to forget about Cherokee Bend
Now the boy wasn't big but he hunted what he could
And they lived for a time that way
But the food run low and the meat went bad
And she said to the boy one day
I'm leaving tonight and I never will return
>From the land of my Spirit Kin
You must take what you need and trade what you can
For a Red Man's grave down in Cherokee Bend
It wasn't very long till she closed her eyes
And he wrapped her in a robe
He found her a place on the side of the hill
And he buried her in the snow
Early in the spring he was seen in the town
With his load looking ragged and thin
Not a year had gone by till he stood once again
In the government store down in Cherokee Bend
He was ten years tall and a Redskin too
So he hadn't much face to save
And the men sat around and they laughed and they clowned
At the talk of a criminal's grave
Then the man from the east didn't smile when he said
You're the son of that Indian scum
If you value your hide then you better abide
By the white man's rules here in Cherokee Bend.
Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
And he spit on the floor of the government store
And it served him to no good end
At the close of the day they had taken him away
To the white man's school down at Cherokee Bend
It's been 21 years since the boy disappeared
Where he run to, nobody knows
But they say he fell in with a man named Jim
And he rides in the rodeos
And they say he returns all alone to a place
Hidden deep in the Kentucky glen
And it's pretty well known who hauled up the stone
To the grave on the hill above Cherokee Bend
Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
There was blood on the floor of the government store
When the men took his daddy away
It was 1910 and they never had a friend
When he died by the rope down at Cherokee Bend

In forest green and in desert sands

Spawn from nature's ancient dream
He moves upon the world of mankind

"Both our families after gathering
We're cutting a baby out
With my grandmother's heirloom antler-handled carving knife
They were under her grand chandelier
Where we all, together, have shared holiday dinner
But it was your father that was holding the knife
Yeah, I begged you not to make me tell ya
Yeah, I pleaded with you to, to leave it alone
I told ya
I told you that you didn't want to know
What went on in my horrible dream
I was peering in through the picture window
It was a heart-warming tableau
Like a Norman Rockwell painting
Until I zoomed in
I was making noises in my sleep
But you wouldn't believe me when I told ya
That I wasn't with someone in my dream
Catfish were wriggling in blood and gore in the kitchen sink
Yeah, I told ya
I told ya

"Lonely table just for one,
in a bright and crowded room
While the music has begun,
i drink to memories in the gloom
Though the music's still the same,
it has a bittersweet refrain
So play the song the way it used to be
Before she left and changed it all to sadness
And maybe if she's passing by the window
She will hear a love song, and a melody
And even if the words are not so tender
she will always remember,
The way it used to be ..
Friends stop by and say hello,
and i laugh and hide the pain
It's quite easy 'til they go,
then the song begins again
So play the song the way it used to be
Before she left and changed it all to sadness
And maybe if she's passing by the window
she would hear our love song, and our melody
And even if the words are not so tender
She will always remember
the way it used to be ..",Pop

It's brazen bulbs mimic death's hyena croon.
He pulls on her wires, she jerks to attention,
She's animated again, she's talking to a hypodermic reflection.
We've watched it all from the window ledge...
The nurses offer their condolences...
Tougnes flapping I can't make out your tone,
Out hearts beat in slow motion.
If we make it to the final scene...
Show me the sapphire pit 
Peel the candy crust off my body 
Throw in the brittle skeleton...
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang?
Can you knit the stiletto back to the bloodstain?
Can you put the bite back the the beast you've broken, tied and tamed?
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain?
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug?
Won't you cut the cord?
Because you can't put the life back into this hospital ward.
She's gonna make it out ok...
But she's shaking like a revolution...
And she stares at the fire all day...

Every ray of sunshine hides a cancerous chime,
Every breath is a bomb.""

Place it somewhere between my shoulders and neck,

And if I never see nobody else that's alright with me,
Cause she's the only one that I need
'Cause, I luv the way she moves, she grooves, Her shoes, she's smooth,
I luv her hair, her teeth, her nails, her feet,
I luv her laugh, her cry, her lips, her eyes,
she's my future, my world,
and I luv that girl",Pop
"I see the mighty fortress crumble, tumble to the ground
Swarms of rumbling bumble bees, consume the frantic crowd
Seething, breeding mescaline drench the pretty girls
Boredom for excuse, there's no more fun in the world
Me outside my window, me inside my door
Inside or outside, I don't give a fuck no more
Say I'm angry, have a lousy attitude
It's hard to be optimistic when I share the world with you
Pretentious asshole, time to move aside
Can't survive on your hypocrisy and lies
You're building up, but you're tearing down
The mighty fortress crumbles, tumbles to the ground
And I can't understand, can't understand, can't comprehend
Indifference to my fellow man, no longer amused
Just pissed off and confused, still I laugh

Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder
My heart, my heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool to let it go on breaking
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh but right now, I wonder
I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm living life just the same
I've been travelling nowhere fast
And what I wanna know, what I wanna know is will it last?

Our bodies look in ancient stance
You whisper something and I

You're acting crazy just like I

You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
Embracing my life between your thighs
We will perform in the deadly skies
Reducing my mind to endless nights
You send my dreams to their demise
Realized by your last vreath

Yeah, and it sure sounds sweet rolling off the tongue

That happened to be on fire
Well, maybe Id jump or maybe Id reconsider
Yeah, maybe Id just climb a little higher

Like a box of matches near an open flame
Id jump 18 storeys from a burning tower
Oh, sooner than Id face this world of shame
Yeah, Id skip this town and jump a westbound train
And you take these fingerling's from my fingers
Spoken with your breath
With white washed eyes and flies that linger
Seems rather forlorn and bereft

And he's gonna take a little stroll way out west

Paul Simon wrote that song about Graceland
While driving in his car
Mark Cohn wrote that other one
It was a big hit, it made Mark Cohn real
I'm walking in Memphis, do I really feel the way I feel?
Well, look at me, Lord, I am at Graceland
On a Saturday afternoon
I threw up last night at a rest stop
From eating cheese grits at the Waffle House
I felt like hell then, I feel alright now
I am at Graceland and I feel alright
I know that Graceland has sacred meaning
Deep, deep meaning for lots of people
For me it don't mean all that much
Okemah means more that's
Woody Guthrie's home
I don't have shrines to Elvis Presley
On the dashboard of my RV
I haven't spotted Elvis lately
In the tool section of the Wal-Mart
But I travel around the country
Playing my guitar for whoever will listen
So I'm at Graceland, I am at Graceland
I am at Graceland and I feel alright

He had the coolest hair
He sang the coolest songs
He made the coolest movies
He moved his hips like wheat fields waving
He was even cool in the army

When troubles come and my heart burdened be,

You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas,
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,
You raise me up, to more than I can be.

"One day on the block
I was speaking to a close partner
A black Caddie rolled up

I felt my soul reach back through times
With my youth was cold and gritty
On the south side of the city
Read the sign it says 'Town of no pity'
First grade was vague
Eighth grade bounce to the east side

Scuffle from Sunday through Saturdays
In alley ways, shady ways
When my Mom wasn't lookin'
A midnight marauder, life was part of
Me dippin' out the window of your daughter
Days come and gone, define who we are
There I am at age 19 a ghetto super star

Angel of death came to claim

Holding a bullet with my name

Life is over, too late to change
I'm walking with shadows
To the Valley of Death, come on
Yeah I'm a dead man walking out
Yeah too late to change
So many escapades led me astray
Look there goes the time I first held an A K
Aimed at your way, itchy finger
Lookin' to turn y'all to dead weight
No role model, living life at full throttle
Mind gone doing wrong, passin' out with a 40 bottle

I kept trippin' as my soul kept drifting through death
I'm remenising my life of non fiction
Globe still spinning witnessing what I'm missin'
And that made me yearn addiction to money, weed and bitches
Game brought me the riches, sabotage from snitches
This is just a chronicle of days come and gone, now

Angel of death came to claim

Holding a bullet with my name

Life is over, too late to change
I'm walking with shadows
To the Valley of Death

Angel of death came to claim

Holding a bullet with my name

Life is over, too late to change
I'm walking with shadows
To the Valley of Death, come on
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying, not to lose my head
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying, not to lose my head

Holding a bullet with my name

Life is over, too late to change

"I live in my own world on 18 wheels
Playing music and writing songs about the way I feel
Tonight I'll play my guitar for you
I'll pour my heart out and tonight it's blue
So gather round and watch me play
I'm putting my misery on display
Well, I was raised with the West Coast bands
And I don't change for anyone, I stay the way I am
I don't do this for fame, I do this for me
It soothes my soul and keeps my sanity
I'll only be here for today
Putting my misery on display
And this road, it's so cold and at times it feels so long
But I just keep moving on and singing you my songs
'Cause I don't know any other way
And I'm putting my misery on display
Tonight I wish someone would hold me
A woman's touch puts my mind at ease
Her lips, her breath up against my skin
Spread her wings and take my body in
And I'll be gone by the break of day
Putting my misery on display
And this road, gets so cold and at times it feels so long
But I just keep moving on and singing you my songs
'Cause I don't know any other way
Than putting my misery on display

I've got this sneaky feeling, gets closer as we play,
After months and months of planning, hard work to hit the road,
No sense of ""security"" you get when you're at home,

And just for you, there is a calendar, not just a need for the time
But just 'cause you're on my mind,
It's made of days, this simple calendar,
But it feels like years going by, where do I cry
I've rearranged my whole life, such things are hard for two,
But still the music keeps me going and my heart is set on you,

I'll take this voyage anyway, and hope someday you'll go",R&B

Look 'em in the eye
Open up your mouth And Say...

But nowhere on earth am I happy without you
Part of my heart will always be yours

I fought a good fight but I loved you too deeply
