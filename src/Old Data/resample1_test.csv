"You work four years, doing nine to five
But you lost your job, yeah this is your life
You got no hope, you got no plan
But the billionaire yeah he's your man

Trump is on your side
Trump is on your side
He's a billionaire who got a free ride
But he's on your side

You work so hard doing everything right
But your wide awake in the middle of the night
You're all alone and you're filled with fear
The billionaire says what you need to hear

Trump is on your side
Trump is on your side
He's never really worked a day in his life
But he's on your side

Don't you really worry cause he
He really cares about you and me
When he doesn't pay his workers and he calls them slobs
It's only cause he cares about american jobs
Of course he's got your back
And he cares about the middle class
Even if he was raised by a billionaire
You know it don't matter cause it really does care

Trump is on your side
Trump is on your side
He's telling you the truth even when he lies
'Cause he's on your side
Trump is on your side
Yet he's on the side
He laughs at soldiers who have fallen and died
But he's on your side

I ain't gotta fuck yo girl I got my own girl
I ain't gotta smoke your weed, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta drink your drink, I got my own drugs

Your pussy get rest to peace, especially murder scene
Hit it from the back, she like hercules, hercules 
Started from a pot, then I took over the spot
Then I took over the plot, then I took over hip hop
Then I started geekin, then I started tweekin
Then I started reachin, then I stop speakin
Finished Monday, started on the weekend
Gas in my car, I got gas in my car
You can smell it when I'm passin your car
It's the last of the raw, all you need is a straw
And when I ain't feelin good, all I need is a mall
Show-n-off ugh
Your pockets on doughnuts, 
Got my posse out in broad day
Been up all night, it's been a long day
I'm trying to get higher fuckin up my phonshway


I ain't gotta fuck yo girl I got my own girl
I ain't gotta smoke your weed, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta drink your drink, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta pop your pills, I got my own drugs

I ain't gotta smoke you weed, I got my own drugs
I really ain't stressin, I ain't even stressin
I really ain't stressin, I ain't even stressin


Styrofoam cups got flying spirt
Double cup full of Ms. Buttersworth
Brown skin bitch in a tennis skirt
With some rolling papers, full of purp
Couple of bad hoes in a penthouse suite
Ya'll broke niggas ain't in my league
I swear this game been good to me
I'm a veteran in this game, why would I leave?
Real niggas, that's all I see, Pimp C, RIP

Push start button like fuck the key

My hoes to fine can't fuck for free
Ya'll niggas out here savin hoes

Lickin on my like an optimo
Get a boy a Sprite and now pour bitch

Magic city, cuttin up, bitch shakin their ass for me
Fuck the bitch in my back seat
If she hit the window, she a crash dummy
I'm a dope boy to get fast money
And we stand our man the most ass for me I'm gone

"Silently to silence fall
In the fields of futile war
Toys of death are spitting lead
Where boys that were our soldiers bled

War horse and war machine
Curse the name of liberty
Marching on as if they should
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?

Once a ploughman hitches his team
Here he sowed?
His little dream
Now bodies, arms and legs are strewn
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom

Each moment's like a year
I've nothing left inside for tears
Comrades dead or dying, lie
I'm left alone asking why

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?

After the war
Left feeling no-one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

After the war
Left feeling no-one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

War is over and battles are gone
After the war that no-one has won
I'm just soldier

After the war
Left feeling no-one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

After the war
Left feeling no-one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

"There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green
He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing
Of the water weeds
While she was busy being free

There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
He calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same
He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaly towers
Of a forest tree
While she was somewhere being free

There's a man who's sent a letter
And he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels
Since the day they said goodbye
He writes ""Wish you were beside me
We can make it if we try""
He has seen her at the office
With her name on all his papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her
From his memory
And she's so busy being free

There's a lady in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl
She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her
For eternity
And she's so busy being free

There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
There's a drummer and a dreamer
And you know there may be more
She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow
Like a cactus tree
While she's so busy being free

Like a cactus tree
Being free

Girl, this love's amazing
Kissing, let’s get it, get at me, do that shit
Pretty young thing, can you be mine, babe?
You wanna smoke with me, get faded
Fuck slowing down
Pick it up, pick it up, roll
In my bed, it's going down
Can I get you all alone?
Think I'ma roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice tonight
’Cause I'm 'bout that life
Want all night, that'll change your life
Think I'ma roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice tonight 

And you my lucky number

I'ma roll the dice


Okay, I'm rollin' and rollin’ and takin’ a chance
Throwin' this money and makin’ her dance
My clothes different, I smoke different
That top flight, that Peter Pan
But I gotta bigger booty in my face right now
Big tig ol' bitties and her waist slimmed down
And she pullin' on my hands, lookin' in my pants
A nigga ’bout to give her all this money right now 
Lay down, lay down backwards
Lick it, write my name in cursive
This spell out some bad words
Own it like I own it
She hop it on it, ride it backwards
Girl, don't stop doin' that damn thing
Throwin' all these dead presidents
'Cause that pussy is my campaign
Vote for it, vote for it, that yaya
Girl, that cookie make a nigga go broke for it, broke for it
I know you wet, I ain't ever gon' let you drown
That's what a real nigga got a boat for, boat for
10 car garages, let's have a ménage
And let's get it poppin' in a four-door, four-door
I started makin' it rain
But I got so much ice on, I'ma make a snow storm
It's awfully cloudy, in my section I'm smokin' maui
Blowin' four O's, that's an Audi
R8, no license plates
A nigga was born in '89, how the fuck we spendin' money from '88?
I guess that means that I'm before my time
And I'm first place and you a second late, yikes!


Girl, this love's amazing
Kissing, let's get it, get at me, do that shit
Pretty young thing, can you be mine, babe?
You wanna smoke with me, get faded
Fuck slowing down
Pick it up, pick it up, roll
In my bed, it's going down
Can I get you all alone?
Think I'ma roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice tonight 
'Cause I'm 'bout that life
Want all night, that'll change your life
Think I'ma roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice tonight 

And you my lucky number
I'ma roll the dice


Look, K-Mac comin' straight from the eighties 
A nigga dabbled in crack in the eighties 
Callin' out all the single, pretty ladies
Which one of y'all wanna have my pretty babies? 
Oh, I think it's you 
Or maybe even you but I like her too 
All y'all cute so a nigga can't lose 
I'ma roll the dice, daddy need a new pair of shoes 
They the new black ones that I got from Louis 
Big house, big broad, livin' in the boonies 
I be so fly, yeah, I got the honies 
And they give me good brain, I don't fuck with dummies 
You know you got that fire, why you trippin'? 
Take a look around you, you ain't got no competition, huh

There's no one in life quite like you, you baby

As I sit and wonder baby how you do the things you do, yeah
I know deep down in my heart I never see all the way through
I smile and I'm glad, you're the best thing that I ever had

There's no one in life quite like you, you, I love you baby
No one in life quite like you, you baby

One more thing, smoke stacks signal your love
Coming from my window pane, yeah
All I need from you baby is to take you in my arms again, yeah
One smile from you is all I need to see me through my day

No one in life quite like you, you, I love you baby
There's no one in life quite like you, hold it back there now, you baby

Here we go
One word from you is all I need
One, one, one kiss from you
Oh, will set me free

There's no one in life quite like you, you
You're so unique baby, I can't I can't explain it
No one in life quite like you, oh baby, you baby

There's no one in life quite like you, you

Like you, like you
Early in the morning, have a smile on your face
Late in the midnight hour, no one can take your place
Even sashay, glass on wine, you're so fine

He's got a really big tongue
It rolls way out
Snaking around in the club
It slicks you down
Scratching his face like a bum
He pulls you back
Circa nineteen-eighty-one

You are, you are shining some glory
On me, on me
You are, you are shining some glory
You are, you are shining some glory on me

I still be ridin' through the hood
Brooklyn to Compton, it's all good
From Southside Queens to Inglewood
We representin' like we should


I'm hot, boy, I told you befo'
Got that Benz and that Hummer off the showroom floor
I know you hate it when I pop up, wrist all rocked up
'Hood empty, niggas locked up, they rats all knocked up
Baby after baby, the 'hood is crazy
Niggas'll set ya up and wet you up, trust me, they shady
Got a pet bulldog I keep under my linen
It don't bark, it spark when that revolver spinnin'
We winnin'


I still be ridin' through the hood
Brooklyn to Compton, it's all good
From Southside Queens to Inglewood
We representin' like we should


Hold up, hold up, get a good look at my rims
Goddamn, look at them twenty-fours inch diamonds spin
Now the D's, they harass me in the 'hood
A few times niggas tried to blast me in the 'hood
Fuck it, it's all good
Catch me in the coupe, on the lean
With needles and samples and diesel for the fiends
The money stay on my mind, so I stay on the grind
Plus niggas like to stun, so I stay with the nine
I ain't the type nigga that be out, runnin' his mouth
Talkin' gangsta and shit, with my gun in the house
Nah, homie, better get to know me better
Before you be leaking pints of blood into your Iceberg sweater
When the talons come flyin' up out the Beretta
You gon' feel like it's your fault and say, ""man, I knew better""
Look, dawg, I don't play that shit
I pull that thing out I'mma spray that shit
That's how I get down


Brooklyn, she's so sick in the hood
Got these fat bitches get the spit in the hood
Cause I throw diamonds, shoot the fifth in the hood
That's what you get for talking all that shit in the hood
Yeah, I'm still a minor, remember this
Everything Brooklyn'll drop you broads'll fall behind her
Brooklyn to Compton, it's all good
Get robbed, get shot, shit is poppin' in the hood


I still be ridin' through the hood
Brooklyn to Compton, it's all good

Flowers bloom, the early part of June
Noon is the time
Stay in tune, there's a lot going through my mind
Got up this morning, smelling like fumes of wine
My man had his bachelor's, an exclusive time
We're getting ready now, he 'bout to walk the aisle
A pimp's funeral, but we're gon' walk in style
I'm feeling proud, yet I'm feeling funny
And it ain't cause his niggas still owe me money
Cause it's my buddy here
We've been through lots of years
Lot of beers, lots of fights, lots of nights
Dreams about our career
Now we're here in these tuxes
I remember back when we was hustlers
Move work, doing dirt, girls say we ho'ed around
Still doing it, we're just older now
Fixing his bow-tie, his collar, I fold it down
I'm the best man, I'm supposed to hold it down
We're sober now, but I'mma be lit tonight
One of these bridesmaids, I might have to hit tonight
He said ""The Light"" is his first song, I'm honored
It's already been drama, she don't like his momma
Maybe that's karma, huh, he's a good cat
A good cat ain't supposed to be with a hoodrat
I knew her back, back, when we went to FAMU
And like a black college, a lot of niggas ran through
Scandalous, the type you can't trust
Whatever you get her is just never enough
Plus, about her, I know too much stuff
Of being straight bogus, she's on the cusp
I'mma hush, cause today is his big day
These colors we're wearing, yeah they're a bit gay
But anyway, I told him when we first started
Now we must toast for the sincerely departed
Am I being jealous-hearted, I'm debating
Maybe cause my guy's in love, I'm just hating
We're waiting on Reverend Clayton and for her to get ready
The church bells is ringing and the ring is real heavy
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy


You remember that, man
You remember that, yo
Yo, I ain't even, I ain't even gonna lie
Yeah, I can't really make it in step with this girl
Nah man, it's what a man's gotta do
It's a good thing for you, man
Yeah, we gon', yeah
It's gonna be right


It's a Black wedding, you know it started late
Family members arguing on who gon' get a plate
His relatives saying they just can't relate
To her being his Mrs., it's a big mistake
I feel the same way, I'm tryna be supportive
It's hard when I think of ball players she then courted
But I ain't gonna agitate, I congratulate
It's like a weave, half is real, half is fake
They knew the caterer, so they got it half the rate
Her father, Mr. Cook, looking like he half baked
Pimped out in red velvet, his suit match the cape
Looking at his watch, damn, how much these pastors make?
But wait, oh shit, there go his ex-girl Shawna
Man, I hope it don't be no drama
That lady in the big hat, that's his grandmama
For him taking a step, I at least gotta honor
Cause maybe she changed, and I'm just tripping
We're walking down the aisle, the CD is skipping
I read between the lines, see, that's the sign
Kind of mixed about when it will be my time
To settle down
Her little niece Sherice throwing petals down
Looking at marriage
Narrow is the aisle, as they were saying their vows
A ghetto phone went off with the song all loud
Wiping my brow, cause now I'm nervous
She looking beautiful in her dress, I'm looking at her curves
It's natural to look, I try to look off
He said, speak or hold your peace, I gave a good cough
""Are you serious?"" The reverend smelling filthy
But on the real, I'm the one feeling guilty
Cause if this was court and I had to tell the truth
I should have told my man before he said I do


I gotta tell you what's good, think it's all bad
I congratulate you like it's all that
Got my dress, I'll stand up for your celebration
Even though it's love imitation
Imitation, imitation
Imitation

Congratulations, my man
For real, good luck with that
Hey, you can't appreciate the sunshine
If it never rains
And it's gonna rain

I don't know why I even try cause you don't want this no more, I would rather leave before I hurt you
And I would have died long ago if I didn't have my faith, I see you're starting to hate me, I see it in your face
My home don't feel like home, just like my heart is empty
You change the number on your phone, so when I call, you ain't gotta listen


And all your girls think that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club, them bitches is basic
Now I'm number one that's lost in love, I can't take it

I'm deep underwater, are you gon' let me drown?
I see you’re happy now, you're the life of the party, acting out
Ain't seen you in months, you ain't call me once


And all your boys say that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club, niggas is basic
Yeah, and I'm the one who's lost in love and I can't take it
I'm on my knees, don't you hate to see me cry? I won't lie


I'm starting to hate me a little more and more each day
I don't know me, it's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do it better


Thinking 'bout you and I, thinking 'bout you and I
My heart's beating in slow motion, knowing that it's over
Thoughts got me thinking 'bout suicide, baby, this is do or die
When you told me it's over, ain't no point in being sober
All I wanna do is fade away, fade away
I hope that God will forgive me cause I know that you ain't gon' miss me
Baby girl I won't try say my goodbyes
You ain't gotta shed a tear for me, baby girl don't cry


I'm starting to hate me a little more and more each day
I don't know me, it's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me

She gathered in my soul
From many a thorn, from many thickets
Her fingers like a weaver's
Quick and cool

And the light came from her body
And the night went through her grace
All summer long she touched me
And I knew her, I knew her
Face to face

And her dress was blue and silver
And her words were few and small
She is the vessel of the whole wide world
Mistress, oh mistress, of us all

Dear Lady, Queen of Solitude
I thank you with my heart
For keeping me so close to thee

Im steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what i do?
Freedom ain't gettin no closer
No matter how far i go
My car is stolen, no registration
Cops patrolin
And now they done stopped me, and I get locked up


They won't let me out, they won't let me out 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out


What's up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should've slid to my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son?
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs all the dime
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What's up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove one what? One love


Headin up town to re-up
Back with a couple keys
The corner blocks on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Makin so much money
Products moving fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag I fucked around and got locked up


They won't let me out, they won't let me out 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out


Cuz visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
Cell mates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up


They won't let me out, they won't let me out

They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

They won't let me out, they won't let me out

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' something word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm gonna put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it lowkey
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love


Pay me a visit 
Send me some magazines 
Send me some money orders 
Pay me a visit, baby 
Cuz I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Where's my lawyer? 
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no
Get me out of here 
Im locked up 
Baby, I'm locked up 
Where's my niggas? On the lock-down
I'm locked up, they won't let me out

I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
Get buck, get buck
Murder, murder, murder, murder on me mind
Murder, murder on me mind
Get buck, get buck
Murder, murder, murder, murder on me mind
Murder, murder on me mind
Get buck, get buck
Murder, murder, murder, murder on me mind
Murder, murder on me mind


Still depressed, still misunderstood
Still popping pills, popping seals, smoking Backwoods
Still smoke a Swisher if you got it with you
Everybody wants me sober, but I'm not a quitter
I say the less you know the better, that West Bank fire-setter
$uicide dream team, it's that codeine fiend
Hellbound is what I'm deemed, surrounded by crime scenes
Only peace that I know is sleep or to be deceased, shit
I can't call it anymore, get more depressed when I'm on tour
Wake up in the middle of a war
Wake up wishin' that I was a fucking corpse, fuck


I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
Get buck, get buck

Yeah, now if we got a problem, then we got a problem
I don't give a fuck, I can't even see that far at the bottom
My cousin toxic, and I'm rotten
This ain't an option, I was opting out responsibility
Turn a new leaf and get it poppin', yuh
Pull up on they fucking ass, all they do is fuckin' ask
""Can I flash you with the gas?""
And so I pull up on they ass, then I ask
""Want to catch the gat's blast?""
It's always back to back

Used to calm my depression, used to call it my progression
Used to make me less upset, and—

Now causes all my depression


Oh, my love—
She said...






Sold out shows, but I don't believe in souls
So I doubt these shows gonna leave me feelin' whole
A couple blunts, I blow, and now I'm idolized, a role model
That'll get 'em to get me to model clothes
I'd rather snort up Roxys 'till that dope bottle rattles
Nope, I'm not about to tackle yet another problem
I'll have to put this one at the bottom
I feel like fucking Sodom and Gomorrah, but life is sweet
Another black petal fallin' down right at my fucking feet
Another flower rotten, a bouquet of efforts
Sour scents are haunting my defeat

Captivate a hunnid-thousand people, still me and the reaper meet
A hunnid-thousand want to meet you, I hope they'll let me be


Damn, I'm about to bust a cap up in these trizzick's crest
I'm thinkin' deadly, and I'm scopin' with that infrared
Kickin' with the hardest click, nigga bodies rottin' up in the ditches
Man, what's a bone when my tone hits like a ton of brizzicks?


I'm able to paint a picture most people can't even see
Basquiat mixed with Monet when that heron in me
Self-critic that's speakin' in cryptic, defying the laws of physics
Let me be specific, sadistic, mister pessimistic
$lickity $loth, the motherfucker they call the antichrist
Used to dream of fans chanting, screaming that ""$uicide""
Now I get on Instagram, and they posting my personal life
I promise it's not what it seems, climb up just to fall down a stream
Drag me to the river
The richer I get, the worse my liver gets
No strippers on my zipper
Still in my room, keep it dark as I can
Remember scrapin' up change just for cigarettes
Immortalized $uicide, no, they won't forget

I got hoes that burn their wrist with the blunt they rolled for me
And now I'm always stoned, always home alone

Churches burnin’, planes fallin' from the sky

Can you tell me why
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why


It was more than a tragedy, emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky, we tryna figure what happened
Burnin’ churches, fearin' God, who can be so cruel?
We all ignorant to AIDS 'til it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans, listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave them a choice
'Cause who are we to say who lives and die, breathes and stops?
All this judgement on other lives needs to stop
What are we livin' for, givin' more back than takin’
On my knees still waitin’ for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned 'cause Pat Buchanan say I’m greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war but can't feed me
It's so easy to regret thangs after they done
Babies catchin' murder cases, scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need, love in doses
In times like these we feel closest, the good die young


Does anybody have an answer why

It seems the good die young

Can anybody tell me why

Now in my world, will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth?
And I had to sleep in a hearse, ’cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin', turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did, so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin' like a star
And this murder got me feelin' like my death ain't far
In the land of stolen cars, don't get no better
Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms and my, father
So tell me somethin'
If I grab my gat and get to dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny?
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
And rest in peace to my grandmother, Mary Clark

Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love won't stop

From jump you kept it true
Helped to feed the crew

Livin' fast, jumpin' the gun
Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja


Does anybody have an answer why

Can anybody tell me why

I know my life ain't promised
Therefore the wise move in silence
Analyze scandalous times
It's hard, dawg, but we managed
And all probably damned for living our lives so unruly
Ain't a preacher that could fool me
There ain't a teacher that could school me
Since a young soldier, never been sober while getting older
Playing this dirty game of life, making it hard to keep my hopes up
I'm hopeless, just another lost soul that lost focus
Homie, the good die young, pay attention and you'll notice


Days go past and as they pass, time move, quicker
No time for wastin', put your hustle down my young dealers
'Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers ain't ridin' 4-3 felony's
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize
Capitalize, mobilize
We in the war, y'all
It's for all y'all
My family, to the ones that's standin'
Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see 
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you don't, man, we sure to be done
And we'll all see exactly why the goods die young


Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why

Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young 
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why



I send this out for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo' homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the former fallen soldiers
That's in the cemeteries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say
""I'll catch you at the crossroads""
The good die young

This for all the families that's in TWA Flight 800
Oklahoma, lil' Yummy Sandifer, Tasha Harlins
All the fallen kids, dead babies, closed caskets

"Restart Electroheart
Deja vu I fall apart
Five minutes falling back
With my Electroheart

I feel divine
It's like I travel faster
As I reboot
The darkness has no empathy

It's hard to see
I feel the world is shattered
In tears they cry
Am I about to be erased
About to be erased

Soulless torn apart
Born to die right from the start
Cyanide runs in my Electroheart

Restart Electroheart
Deja vu I fall apart
Five minutes falling back renewed
Recharge Electroheart
Never left it from the start
Timer set I left the past for you

And as silence surrounds me
With echoes of cries
From my imminent life
With my Electroheart

I plant the seed
To make them struggle harder
I reap their tears
Bring harvest from their misery

Repent repeat
The force of life is scattered
Indeed I try to cleanse it
To infinity

About to be erased


Feel your soul depart
Now your flesh is my own art
Cyanide runs in my Electroheart

Never left it from the start
Timer set I left the past for you

And as silence surrounds me
With echoes of cries
From my imminent life

It's out of context
I better come back
With my my complexity

Fractals
What I can't bring back
I came in contact
With my depravity

Never left it from the start

One, two
To a nigga nature
Hehe


No need to cry now, go wipe your tears
Be a woman, why you actin' surprised?
You showed the bullshit; commin' fake hair
Fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Ain't nothin' hard about it
Why you lookin' sad, should'a though about it
Say you learn, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla ""Dom Pérignon""
Knowin' I'm a cash dealer, still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me
Plus you was smilin' 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for trynna dick me
Missed me with that ""buy me this, buy me that""- syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad 'cuz I cursed and I screamed I hate ya
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me


Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way


Probably too nice at first
I lettin' you kiss where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slangin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, toungkissin', you was truly with it
Little Ecstasy, Hennessey, mix with me
Picture me pray for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' at the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the room, call the cops
Nigga, hit them walls til the bastard drop
Label me: Makaveli - Thug Nigga with pipe
Livin' life as a Rock Star friday nights
Make money, get pussy
Always keep a pager, cell-phone in the ride
To complete my Nature now!


Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way


Started as a seed from the semen
Straight outta Papa's nuts, lustin' for creamin'
Bitches wit big butts, curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno fleeks
Sneak weed in, helped a nigga passed the time
With my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood
Follow me, I got a gun on me
Goin' for nun on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' til I die
Picture of nigga in heaven high, of weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies with the phonies that died
Hit the weed and hope it get me high
Dear God, understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart
In a realla nigga nature!


Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way
Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way

My foundation was rocked
My tried and true way to deal was to vanish
My departures were old I stood in the room shaking in my boots
At that particular time love had challenged me to stay
At that particular moment I knew not run away again
That particular month I was ready to investigate with you
At that particular time


We thought a break would be good for four months we sat and vacillated
We thought a small time apart would clear up the doubts that were abounding
At that particular time love encouraged me to wait
At that particular moment it helped me to be patient
That particular month we needed time to marinate in what ""us"" meant


I've always wanted for you what you've wanted for yourself
And yet I wanted to save us high water or hell
And I kept on ignoring the ambivalence you felt
And in the meantime I lost myself
In the meantime I lost myself
I'm sorry I lost myself¡-.i am


You knew you needed more time time spent alone with no distraction
You felt you needed to fly solo and high to define what you wanted
At that particular time love encouraged me to leave
At that particular moment I knew staying with you meant deserting me
That particular month was harder than you'd believe but I still left
At that particular time

My day will come, I gave too much
I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I only want, your dying love, I've seen enough


I tried but, I don't think so, maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give but, it seems like it never really was enough


I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But, how will you ever know if you never try?
There's something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever we're apart
I've seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look, the more I find


So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want


You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But, I'm fearless and brave when I'm in the arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me upright
When I'm short of falling


So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want


There will be times
When we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams
No doubt that we'll almost fall apart
Then burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But, without each other, nothing else is enough


So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want


You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no

Don't like what I like don't come around me
Spit hot heat till' the room gets cloudy
Jump on stage
Smashed of the wave made the whole crowd mosh
Everybody got rowdy
I was screaming and shouting loudly
Pass curfew and the place still bouncing
Fuck any wise guy now I'm higher than a kite flies
Cut ties with the fuck boys around me
Pull a red card in foulin' counting the score , it's amounting
I can achieve more without them
Born unto this earth all by myself so fuck anyone that's doubting
Basics wanna hate thats old and outdated
Go on compare our surroundings
You're not bad 
Fuck it I've had enough your style is shit and I'm tellin ya'
I wish that someone would bury ya
Practice on the mic
Real shit from the inside I am no spectator
I'm comin' major mind in the line
Like dark side call me Darth Vader
I can't stand how they wanna move
Walk on the sky like my name was Luke
I'm with the force with my force in the booth
I know myself ain't got nothing to prove


Poring these shots down my throat
Thats how I cope nigga, woah
My life is heaven for sure
Hide in the dark with padlocks on my door
Got my mind stay on working till I'm broke and I'm sore
What have you got in store? What you asking me for?
I'm on cloud 9 when you're stuck on the floor
I got a lot but I'm ready for more
My team never takes losses we killing the score nigga woah
How ya feelin'


Early in the am tryna fix up all my lyrics
Niggas pissing of the neighbours
They can hear it through the ceiling
Nigga woah
We dont even listen
My lane, fuck your image
You're not hot, that shits fiction
Been a lab rat, took time,

You're like a fake diamond
Sparklin' when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them

You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone



I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me

Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby, you're on the run

Kissin' me when the camera's on

Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want

Tried to make him better

The only time he'll choose you
When theres's something to lose through

You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some 'Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothing spookier
You now about to witness the power


When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies


Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
You was HEARTLESS on yo' hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD
Know I meant, every mother fuckin' word!
When we ride on our enemies


When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies, hehe
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies

To get you moving

On a hunt for 100 proof men
For the ones in the Son set free from sin
Not bound by their religion or their pigment
Skin color, cause that don't make them your brother
So you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover
Instead be led and live for the Father
See Red is the model because He bled for us partner
And
If this is true then what this means, is
You should do exactly what He preached
And, see the world through the lens of Christ
Extend love to everyone who wants to live this life
And let's go

This is a movement to get you moving

Yes sir 
I peep the sin of men
Because of different melanin they never let us in
And so what 
It doesn't matter if he's different
We should learn to love him
Especially the Christian, I mean
Look at Jesus walking on the sea of Galilee
Just so He could reach the Gentiles, like you and me
And that sea
Guaranteed to keep Gentiles from where the Jews lived but
Jesus used it as a bridge
And walked on it
So it's time to walk hommie
For the Christian this love should be more than talk hommie
But a lifestyle, right now
If you seeking change
Then seek Jesus name and say this mane


This is a movement
For improvement
Reconcile relationships that's been ruined, yeah!
Got black, got brown, got white
Got fam across the globe because we all got Christ
Indwelled by the Spirit so now we all got light
They don't label me with colors, they just say that boy bright
I used to think black power, black thought, black owned
And then your boy blacked out, when I saw that throne
The issue's dead cause He bled

Chissa che sognerai
Quante mattine ti ho vista accanto a me
Con gli occhi tuoi nei miei
Conosco come sei, conosco cosa vuoi

A vivere con noi
E ci ha costretti a crescere
Ma invecchia solo lei
Lei non ci frega piu', lei non ci butta

Liberi ma con dei limiti
Sacrificando i Sogni alle abitudini

Ora svegliati voglio dirtelo

There's where I have roamed for many long years
There's where my heart's been tendin most ever
There's where the first step of misfortune I made

It's about thirty years when I courted and married
Armanda Gilbraith I'd soon call my wife
My brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three month's later I'd taken Tom's life

I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in that county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next mornin'
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard

When the train pulled out poor Mother stood weepin'
And sister she sat all alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was ""Willy God bless you""
Was ""Willy God bless you God bless you goodbye""

In the scorching hot sand of the foundry I'm workin'
Toiling and working my poor life away
They'll measure my grave on the banks of old Cumberland
Just as soon as I finish the rest of my days

Heaven sent, I was meant for a late view
Lived the life, unknown the most
Never boast, got that grown approach
I get it in, professor with the dividends
Doe or Die, succesor of my sibblings
You know it
From petty crimes to a street poet
It's all the grind, steady mind, taught to keep forward
The game's crucial, no gangs I remain neutral
It's more fruitful, trueful I'm living beauful 
What the loot do, love it or leave it
Minor beef to above it to breathe it

The stress numb me
Death is the last thing left
So get from me if your math ain't matching your words

His and hers is all captured on the camera lens
I'm what it was, for the buzz and the torch was lit
Never a dud, you all bug, get off my dick
Y'all need hugs, I'm just trying to mind my own
Little patron, few shines, all kind of colognes
Monotone, it's assertiveness that come when you grown
I sense nervouseness, y'all know I'm in that murderous zone
But still courties, shake hands and kiss the kids
Make plans with the Ms. take trips to live
Why bid when the smart got a lot of advantage

And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time
But little did we know

Day is dawning and I must go
You're asleep, but still, I'm sure you'll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along


Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations


When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
For a no-good bum like me
To live is to be free


Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations


Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord, give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained

I got some bad habits, I do some shit I shouldn't

Selling dope from out ya house, I know you praying for me

"Writer's Minor Holiday

Thumb tacks spread out
Across your hometown state
Hollow tree at half mast
Wait until wintertime
Leaves a paper trail a licorice plant that's overgrown

Like a cabin in the woods on a minor
Like a minor holiday

Woolrich red plaid wolf
Irish whiskey glass
Here comes my fine bright haired lass
Like a trash fire burning and burning it
My heart could never right the words never fail

Tucked under your cap and for a moment
There's a stillness before the room spins again
Minor holiday, spin it again
Ride it out so you can tell

Wasted on the weekend
Making good time with my excuse
Where the plot lines are like dead ends
Floating in her eyes at the bottom of a well
Floating in her eyes ride it out for a spell
Minor holiday
Transfer this weight
Minor holiday
Transfer this weight
Going back and forth
On a minor, minor holiday

Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer


And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town


Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire


And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town


There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a fuck if I go
Down, down, down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing
Oh, my heart is a ghost town


Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
Oh, my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they should've killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin' crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm losin' hope, they got me stressin', can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennessey got me queasy
Don't wanna hurl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
Slangin' rocks with your Glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin from the cops—and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows



Lord knows


The Lord knows


The Lord knows



I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
And every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin' over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
Take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin' niggas, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breathe
Got me thinking, what do Hell got?
Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin' shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin' game
And Lord knows



Lord knows


The Lord knows


The Lord knows



One-time! One-time!
Fuck the 5-0 cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let 'em capture me
Done lost too many niggas to this gangbangin'
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin', fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man 
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin' up
I'm gettin' lost in the weed, man, gettin' high
Livin' every day, like I'm gon' die 
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out

Out on the street, I watch tomorrow becomin' today

The door still creaks, the roof still leaks
When the rain comes falling down
The dog still barks at every car that comes around
My boss at work, he's still a jerk
That isn't nothing new
I'm such a dope, my heart's still broke
Because I still love you


My favorite picture of you is still on my windowsill
You wrote to me don't ever change
And I'm afraid I never will


When day is done the night still comes
And aaaaaai still toss and turn
I still try to have some pride
While the bridge still burns
My arms still ache, my heart still waits
And I know there's no use
I'm still a fool and it's so cruel
Because I still love you

Junior year you were A's and B's
Right on track, homecomin' queen
But the day we met
You had your heart set on that badboy thing
And your daddy swore I was trouble
So, I snuck you out to cuddle up
Next to me in that middle seat
We'd roll backroads, hold hands, and sing


We were Romeo and Juliet
Breakin' out in a sweat
Makin' out in the bed
Of a beat up truck
Slap covered in mud
You swore I was lyin'
I swore I was stuck
By the bare footprint on a fogged up window
A big ol' heart around our initials
We told all our friends
That it was love
And it was love
At least we thought it was


You had to wait 'til you turned 18
Earned that ring
Hit one knee
Just like we planned
Tried our hand at that old runaway thing
And I didn't know where I was goin'
But I remember your hair was blowin in the wind
I just knew it then
That what we had would never end


We were Bonnie and Clyde
Rollin' 95
Burnin treads on the tires
Barely a dime
Both our names musta gone insane
Thinkin' we'd get somewhere on half a tank
On the side and at the end of our road
With just enough cash to get you home
We believed all we'd ever need was love
And we had love
At least we thought it was


Love at first sight
I remember that first night
What a beautiful girl
But I grew up and now I see
It just wasn't meant to be
I think it was us against the world


We were Romeo and Juliet
Breakin' out in a sweat
Makin' out in the bed
Of a beat up truck
Slap covered in mud
You swore I was lyin'

With a young man's heart
And a young man's roots

I don't run like I used to

And I used to nod

But I hear a lot
Don't believe for a second
That my key won't fit your door

Where the river run still
And the water don't flow
Heaven couldn't stop me then

And the creek don't rise
And life goes by

Where the devil sits with a grin

A young man's heart
And a young man's choice
Hope my song is what you're longing for

Somehow keeps on hanging on

There it is again

And every now and then that old feeling comes around
Every now and then I see your face in another cloud
And every now and then some old something takes me right back again
Every now and then


You can finally breathe life in
Without wondering where she's been
Go to sleep at night without her on your mind
In a second it appears
Followed by familiar tears
Like a long lost friend
Every now and then




And I know it's all for nothing
There's no going back to way back then




I still love you

And in the arms of the life that we adore
Moonlight shows a white design
That’s been waiting for a chance to seize the soul once more

“Sweet lad, o come and join me, do!""
On a road
""Such pretty games I will play with you”
Changing course

Lightning strikes where we depart
An eerie voice as the night embraced the heart
Resonating from the life and is moving on
To the new window of the soul

“Will you, sweet lad, come along with me?
My daughters shall care for you tenderly”
Hear his mystic voice
“I love you, for your comeliness charms me, my boy!
And if you’re not willing, my force I’ll employ”
He feeds on stainless souls

We are struck in the night
Ancient power will strike
Feel the fire

Now run into his arms
Leave your shelter behind
We are going to fly

Higher than high
We will take on the sky
Feel my senses
United by the night

Now it’s time to close the door
And open up like before
New windows of the soul
The silence of the void
A father’s life destroyed

Stuck in the night
Ancient power will strike
Feel the fire
Burn inside
Run into my arms
Leave your shelter behind

We are going to fly
See us fly
And hear our cry
We’re out of sight
Higher than high we will

Take on the sky
Feel my senses
Out of my sight
But live on my mind
New windows of our soul

Though the angels dance on the head of another pin

I like Johnny Cash and Grandmaster Flash


Ohhhhh
They call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw a finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say ""Hey, hey""
Let me hear where you're at and say 
I'm giving it back so say 
Show me some metal and say 


Yeah, I saw your band
Jumping around on stage like a bunch of wounded ducks 
When you gonna learn sucker?
You just can't fuck with Twisted Brown Trucker!


I'm an American Bad Ass, watch me kick
You can roll with Rock or you can suck my dick
I'm a porno flick, I'm like Amazing Grace
I'm gonna fuck some hoes after I rock this place
Super fly living double wide
Side car on my Glide so Joe C can ride
Full sack to share, bringin flash and flair
Got the long hair swinging, middle finger in the air
Snake skin suit, 65 Chevelle
See me ride in sin hear the rebel yell
I won't live to tell, so if you do
Give the next generation a big ""Fuck you!""
Who knew I'd blow up like Oklahoma
Said fuck high school, pissed on my diploma
Smell the aroma, check my hits
I know it stinks in here, cause I'm the shit


Ohhhhh
They call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw a finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say 
Let me hear where you're at and say 
I'm giving it back so say 
Show me some metal and say 


I'm a cowboy, bad ass in black singing

From side to side, from front to back Say

I put Detroit City back on the map by singin'

Kid Rock's in the house and that's where I'm at!

Everybody wanna take chips
It's either that or nigga wanna play sick
Try n' floor us when I'm round with a fake bitch
When I see certain niggas I don't say shit
Motherfucker like me try to stay big
Who you got laying down in a ""stay there""
Different whips I can do it any kind of way
From this A to the Crist to the Chardonnay
Through the belt, from the pipe to the parkway
Everything a nigga touch is like park-ay
Get it right, bill nigga let it light
From the stand though, two mil, living life
Lose chicks from the streets better get it tight
Free pussy played out better get a price
So where we at now


AZ's back 

Where we at?

AZ's back

Where we at?

AZ's back



Know niggas from both coast
Everybody built pride but they hold toast
No joke, fuck co' but a whole load
Lone cones got bombs and .04s
'91 put cha stickers wit the low cone
Who's down getting' blunted and tryin' blow smoke
Take notes, love cars only one side
Always talk to blend in wit the young guys
Hustle up, play the block till the sunrise
Fuck wit us, motherfucker you just gon' die
That's that, where are the real hard haters at?
Only who jack niggas sittin' back
Hit the broad, let 'em ball, nigga play it all
Wanna walk wit cha guns, nigga make the call
Where we at now?




Run away from the funny style
Cut those fake niggas wit tha funny smile
Every hater in the game wanna run me out
Everybody that's broke wanna run their mouth
What that be about the time nigga see the cloud
Won't stop til every last dollar, we even now
Give it all back, bills in a small stack
Stack a whole lotta shit in the door crack
Where we at now?




AZ is back, y'all better watch out
AZ is back, y'all better watch out

I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy


I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

Step in the club and wardrobe intact now

They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin'

Hawaiian tropic, dark, and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face


Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish


Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag


Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone


Copacabana, yes in my party dress
I’m shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile


Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lyin'?


And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king


Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone



I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses


Every man gets his wish

Riding with a head full of buckets of red
And when they said still stuck in the head
A thoroughbred thoroughly bled
And led to the land of the mental combats
Following a front attack so you can never run from that

The planet sizing up the horizon
Smaller than a fly stand, I'm a lyrical lamp
The power that I got on my cynical hand
With a pen, once again

Swimming in the center of the hit or the miss
Reeling in my thoughts getting lost in the mist
Realizing one not the size of the fist
And the killing of the killer with a flick of the wrist


I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them

I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head


The second it's gone
The weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
Eternity-you have not- So in that, you can't fight nor flee
Still, you'd be around if it wasn't for me

Way back first whatever my friends
That you see the attraction of the payback
Don't want me to say that, playback the thing now
Getting lost in the chaos tossing it down

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic in my confine

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic in my confine


I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them

Well, bartender's working on a late night shift
Cheap bums and blondes and barmaids on a midnight drift
And the dance band's playing the same old sling
I'm sinkin' whiskey and you're sippin' fine wine
I don't know what it is you're trying to prove
Well, it should be you, but it's me who can hardly move
And I've got my reputation lyin' on the line
Come on, baby, be a good dog, and
And help the blind


Oh, won't you carry me home?
Oh, to carry me home
Oh, to carry me home

Like a truck, pick me up


You ain't no lady, but you sure got taste in men
That head of yours has got you by, time and time again
My arms and legs are achin' and my head's about to blow
And your back's been breakin' and I'd hate to spoil the show
But I just spent next week's wages and I'm right out of coin
But you want more and it's half past four, and they want to close the joint
And we can't afford a taxi, and it's too late for the bus
But I've been told by friends of mine you're someone I can trust


Carry me home
Oh, won't you carry me home
Carry me home

Don't leave me lying here, in all this beer!




You drank all your booze and half of mine
I'm bleary eyed and you're waiting for the sunshine

Just like the man who threw me on the floor
Don't matter, while I'm down here, I might as well try and find the back end door
Excuse me, have you seen it?
It's about this big

Man Up


Momma want some Obama in me, The hood want 'Pac
Hip Hop want to see the Common in me
And since it's a senseless contradiction
I end up a misfit trying to fit in
This ends when I stand up
And see the hands of the standard, holy is the Lamb huh
Now we holding you to Man Up
Cause we were made in His image
Start lookin' at what you came from



Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy is Adamic
Adamant
After what Adonai is against
Let me take you back to the tree in Eden
If you read it you'll see that Eve was deceived
But Adam's the one who let her eat
Instead of leading
No we ain't leading
We bump that
Basically little boys with muscles and our mustache
To femininity we need a remedy
The God-Man 100% masculinity


We the last
Yeah
Where the men at?
It seems like they all lost
None of them are on the scene it seems like they died off
They extinct but my dream is to rise up
We chasin' the prize of the King, the divine boss
But we fell away, now we ungodly
We lose and we really got the blues like Navi
I want to celebrate the dudes that's beside me
Fellas let's elevate, we do with the lively


They lie
Go ahead dead boy get your shine on
And if a sucka try to buck ya get your 9 homes
That's what I heard you gotta do to be a man now
Stand up for yourself so I took it in my hands now
And that's the problem man we busy tryin' to solve it
All the while we walking dead, man somebody bring the coffin
Voice dropped, peach fuzz
Now you think that you a man 'cus you feelin' yourself
You need to Man Up


There's many things men is chasing after
They got some questions, we got some answers
Sex and models and tippin' bottles back
Pile up excuses right next to your bottle caps
A Rolodex filled with names that you aim to please
Next to the stack of money building up a heart of greed
Ice on his neck givin' jokers the cold shoulder
You drunk off pride plus you lovin' the hangover
You gotta whole lot of stuff that won't amount to gain
Life will never make sense because you never made change


You got it twisted and sick like a fever
Lil' man live to stack dough, Keebler
Man up, get up outta the tree house
Leave the cookies alone it's time to eat meat now
Tryna show you a new way to live now
No charge, You can call it a freestyle
Without Christ your normal man is
A boy in a man's body like Tom Hanks in ""Big""


Yeah
Bein' a man ain't got nothin' to do with age
You could be a boy 'til the day you lay in a grave
None of us behave like the image of who we're made
Cause we fall in the way, it's better known as depraved
Runnin' from responsibility
Really we crave the easy way out of places that call us to pull our weight
Man they goin' through every day decisions are made
Responding to the call God's given them from the gate



Let the process begin, let's separate the boys from the men...

It don't matter how you started, partner, it's about how you end...

Jesus is the model, follow us we will follow him

We the last of a dying breed it's time that we...

In her dreams so she thinks her
Foundation is crumbling away
Fault lines in her words
Open to show a soul disturbed
That has shaped her to what she is today

Getting through to her
Getting through to her
Getting through to her
Getting through to her

Sometimes when I call
She tells me things that were not her fault
And her surface will start to break
Breakdown a hurting sound
I wanna tell her that it’s ok now
But I’m not too sure just what to say

All she wants is some breathing room
If not tomorrow surely one day soon
All she wants is some breathing room
If not tomorrow surely one day soon

Excuse me did she say
She wished she went away
And not return to the shame
Brought to her those days
We’ll take man’s dirty deeds
And suck them out by cosmic means
Into the sun hurl them
Where they’ll be happy burning
But life is not t.v
Life is not t.v
Life is not t.v

And well Crazy Horse that’s me

Sometimes that’s all I need

To the homes where the Who's lay a-snooze in their town
""This is stop number one,"" the old Grinchy Claus hissed
As he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist
Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch
Then he slithered and slunked, with a smile most unpleasant
Around the whole room, and he took every present
Pop-guns! Pompo-nooze! And cookie! And drums! Checkerboards! Mistle-binks! Popcorn! And plums!
And he stuffed them in bags
Then the Grinch, very nimbly stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney

Stop if you ain't got a million in your hand
Pissing in your pants cause they let a nigga free
Want to say a little grants then just let a nigga be
Low sweaters with the V's, thick alls with the moccs
Down in D.C. cause them doors don't lock

Of course about the motherload cause I ain't trying to cut a throat

Place them in a tux and face them straight up

"Non devi dire di no ... ti prego
Voglio ballare con te .... mi piaci
Quando ti muovi così .... divina
Voglio solo tenerti stretta
Il tempo di una canzone
E sentire i tuoi palpiti su di me

Ma se non balli con me... io muoio
Già vedo un falco lassù .... che gira
Ti prego vieni con me ... e danza

Tu sarai eternamente mia
Soltanto per questo ballo
Il tempo per non dimenticarti più

Non devi dire di no...ti prego
Vuole ballare con te..gli piaci
Quando ti muovi così...divina

Vuole solo tenerti stretta
Il tempo di una canzone
E sentire i tuoi palpiti su di lui

Su avvicinati di più...ti prego
Si è così che tu mi pia'...ci quando
Ti strofini su di me...amore

Sento un fremito che mi prende
Dal profondo del tuo ventre
Che mi brucia di passione per te

Lei fra le braccia di lui...si scioglie
""io sono pazza di te""...gli dice
Sottraendosi a lui...per poco

Poi girandosi di schiena
Lei si lascia toccare tutta
Premendo il suo corpo contro di lui

Tu sei l'amore di Dio..che splende
Anche quando finirà la danza
Che mi ha fatto innamorare di te

Io vivrò di questi istanti
Che fuggenti non sono più
Anche se con un altro tu vivrai

Tu sarai eternamente sua
In questi attimi d'amore
Che appartengono solamente a voi due

Anger inside builds within my body
Why'd you hit me?
What have I done?
You tried to hit me!


Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me ’cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy, and you’re harder than me
What's with you boy, think hard
A tattooed body too, hide who you are
Scared, to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man!


I don't run around
Trying to be what's not within me
Look into my eyes, I am free
You're just a wannabe!


Scream at me again, if you like
Throw your hate at me, with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy, and you’re harder than me
What’s with you boy, think hard
A tattooed body too, hide who you are
Scared, to be honest, be yourself
A cowardly man!


To come out...

Hit me, clown, because I'm not from your town now

Clown you ! Turn around!

Scream if you like
Throw your hate at me, with all your might
Hit me 'cause I’m strange, hit me

Man I feel like I deserve this shit
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't help me grind for this shit
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more


Shootouts on shootouts on shootouts on shootouts
Young nigga done been on them shootouts
Where yo ass was at dog?
When we was in Wynhollows, nigga, with them tools out
Compton Red's in the cut tryna hit the dope, nigga where the cut in
Tied his partna up in the cut
Me and Lil Harold had took a laptop
That nigga had bussed so the nigga got popped
Me and Johny tried to rob everything
Mookie tried to tell us, do the right thing
Larry died man I cried twice
Chevy went down the road nigga twice
They tried to give my nigga Teetay life
Tip and Metro nigga ready to fight
I keep Lotto with me, real ripe
Pussy niggas, nigga we don't like
Free Lil Tooto, he gon' open a fight
RIP Tayman that's why I got that knife
I don't get excited about the fame
Bitch I'm still with the same gang, bitch I still claim the same thing
Still take a pussy nigga chain

Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more


12 can't arrest me no more, ain't no roaches on the floor
Ain't no flowers in this clique, ain't no flowers in this shit
We done cut the snakes off, had to cut them niggas off
Niggas don't wanna see you with nothing, unless you giving these niggas something
I had to get me some money, bitch and that drum hold a hunnid
You run up, you know that I'm gunning, 2Pac nigga, thugging
A lot of niggas changed on me, I just bought some chains on me
I just bought a Range Rover, this shit ain't 'bout the fame homie
Mookie told me I deserve it, momma told me I deserve it
I know if Tayman was alive, he would tell me I deserved it
I got the sack and start splurgin', balling like I'm James Worthy
Pussy niggas ain't worth it, before I did some other murders

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar


They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry


There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando


Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land


There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando


If I had to do the same again

First off, it's the first in the loft
First to peel off in that pretty little Porsche
Pretty little women with their skin so soft
And that triple beige linen stay bigging up, New York
You know them haters goin' talk
And do what they do so a player can't floss
Well motherfucker, I'm a boss
Rich boy, hustler, slimmer Rick Ross
So don't get it crisscrossed
I'm a bit pissed off but the wrist still frost
Neck all chipped up, kicks still cost
I leave foreign change, I done catered out the Range
Me and you the same, homie, get it out your brain
South beach with it, I done did it out in Spain
Was never heavy with the fame
But the name still bang 'cause I'm heavy in the game


Yessir I'm heavy in the game 
I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not then you're only in the way 
'Cause this time  I'm heavy in the game

Influence to Costa Nostra, this is me

And I ain't here to hurt nobody
I'm just here to watch chicks work their body, and
Back somethin' like Laila Ali, and
Head back to the hotel lobby, and

Who else could it be homie, who but me
Fresh Prince of the projects, Kool Moe Dee
With my Tom Ford shades and 'em up North ways 
I'm just tryin' behave
Tryin' get it how I get it 'til I'm finally paid 
Yes I'm finally made

I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not then you're only in the way

So at this point, in the uh-major is insignificant
It's all about the Cons' and the way that I be rippin' shit

Now they take to him, like valleys in California
Come what you want, fire, that's when the hoes is on you
I'll still be on the corner and I feel no shame
'Cause I bet you they goin' kick it like when your field goal range
So if you don't know the name of the killer you see
Let me spell it out for you like a kid at a bee
See I gotta get mine, no matter the consequences
That's why they feel the kid like one of the five senses
So why raise the question about my demographic
When everybody knows that my demo was a classic
I'm in the driver's seat like chauffeur in traffic
So you don't want to try with the Cons' you bastards


Yessir I'm heavy in the game 
I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not then you're only in the way

And how it always will be
And believe things will never change

A ray of hope remains if we take the reins we'll arrive eventually

Keep all the lights on in the streets of Babylon
Then we’ll just dig for some more
Pull back the curtain 'cuz one thing's for certain
Action speaks louder than war


Look around there's no time left to stall
 stand up while you can don't miss the call


Hold on here we go
Where we stop nobody knows

Cleverly disguised

Now we’re moving fast
We’re picking up on speed
We got the energy
Creating fast
As we tunnel deep
And no time to think
Here we just react
To the things
We need
Hold on to your world




To live just in your mind
Is some kind of crime
Stuck in your station
In isolation
Never too late for beginning
To set your captive free

Tonight the moment has arrived
To live while we’re still alive

They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way


Tell me lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellraiser can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin' to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the poor babies rushin' into early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear lord I live the life of a thug hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock
Tell me lord can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggas burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row


They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way


Dear lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin' please come save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' ""die motherfucker!"" and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover!
Aww shit, ""Thug-Life motherfucker, duck quick!""
Now am I wrong if I am, don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Dear lord if ya hear me tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it
It shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl
Killed Latasha
Now I'm screamin' fuck the world!


They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way


Yeah
That nigga who hold it down for Uptown, hahahaha!
That's how we do it out here
On this underground real shit nigga
This the heat nigga
Now rewind this motherfucker

"Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us

That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale

So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below

When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness

And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes

And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
""Space enough"" said Baal, ""then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb""

Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much

Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you

Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep

Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup

When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead

Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us

Yo I'ma stay custom, 'til I'm old grey and rustin'
Reminiscin the number of chickens that claim we fucked 'em
Bet some badder hoes than them other funky rappers chose

Here's the army that you mowed to the ground
And the bodies you left lying around
Talking it out
The last hour
I'm through trying now
It's a big relief
I'll be staying down
Where no one else gonna give me grief


Mess me around
Just make it over


Your opinion was the law of the land
The single thing that I could always understand
I lived it out from hour to hour
The only thing that never really changed
You ran me all around
And dragged me down
At the end of the day


Don't keep me around
Just make it over

Situations that I passed up for this
One-way love I took for hours

Got something here I want you all to know
When life and people bring on primal screams
You got to think of

Don't break it
I said make It
Don't break it

You know that history repeats itself
What you just done, so has somebody else
You know you do, you've got to think up fast
You've got to figure what it's going to take to make it last

Don't break it

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catching the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose
You're only paying your dues


Dues is the price that you gotta pay
And if you don't they'll get you anyway
Although you know what you've been going through
You're on the brink so think what it takes to...

There's no other man
Can make me feel the way you do

Hopes that you make it there

Loneliness is my biggest fear

That's what I need the most

Share your gifts from town to town

And I hear your voice
Telling me you can't wait until you're home

And I can't sleep at night 'cause

Outta here, ya heard

Floss with me and stash holds more than 50
Snatchin the baddest bitch no luggage, we off to Sicily
First class flights, see me shine matchin in white
Gatored up with the faded cut flashin the ice
Fuck that, niggas know me, keep low key
Sneezers nosy, live niggas creep OT
From all the hustle on the streets daily numbin the brain
From drainin out of his game but we runnin the same
Loving the pain, thug niggas thuggin in the rain
Broke niggas stay broke stingy huggin they chain
Church niggas just chill stay connect and thoughts
While the vest they lost warrants catch them in courts
Catchin the source, the students that lessons is taught
I been near through my younger years perfecting the sport
All praises do for all those facing the zoo, this is the crew
Soon we'll be blazin that chew

Hit the streets strap up go to war for y'all
Its all for y'all, Champagne across the ball
Late night hit the strip see me floss the car
Hit for now, all smiles no tears for now
Quiet money know the styles see all years from now
Anti, still camerin shots when remise with eyes
And hands through the wise
Strong ties dance with the live
Act hold up, my whole team actin all up
Brooklyn! hear to speak niggas packin all up
Poet at heart, dart making throwin at them charge
Hit or miss still a way splitter blow them a part
Flow with the sharks, real killers coat with the dark
Is these playin in the streets they awoke to the art
AZ on your project walls act to the halls
Respect all the laws, its locked now check all the doors



What y'all niggas want, y'all know who y'all fuckin wit
What up

From all the new, solar now roll with the crew
Young in, now a nigga just know what to do
Trustin a few, feds had me flushin pervu
You fuckin with who?
Slippin I'll be bustin at you
Money to get, y'all niggas that run your shit
Dum on your bitch, butt fuck her cum on her tits
I'm young and convinced, captive trainin for T's
You ain't in my league just chill and keep blowin your weed
Quiet as kept, cash flow relyin on my rep
Sizing the threat, down for like knives in the vest
Sure shots for the war blocks caught in the box

Twist up the game, switch up the chain, play peek-a-boo
I take ya girl and her friend and do a switch-a-roo
Started with a nick and got a 62
It was memorable, my planets were digable
Used to stashing work off in a inner tube
In middle school I worked the trap no interviews
Just told shawty that I'm in to you
I'm the type that make a old school a Bentley coupe
Turn one to ten, that's what I tend to do
It's an amber alert I gotta missing roof
It was black and it was traveling fast
I love you now I don't care about your ratchet past
Designer shoes, matching bags
Let them niggas pop shit baby we popping tags
If I ever fall off I'll be hopping back
Got a bad bitch with me told her hop in back

I be eating MC's nigga shark teeth
Velourz hoodie, I ask em whats for goody
If you are what you eat but I am not a pussy
You couldn't stop me with a bunch of Uzi's

Hand full of ones pocket full of Hunn

Designer sneaks leather seats
They say money talk thats why you never speak
Every verse I do is a rest in peace
Wish this highway to heaven had an extra seat
Rap game, extra sweet
Big ass charm conversation peice


Million off rap but the trap was sweeter
When dealings on the block all prices cheaper
I been doing this since guess and fila
They say my entourage each car four deep eight heaters
Drop the middle man to cut the cost
They say my whole click cut from a different cloth
And of course, we pay the cost, with each block that we off
You take off and call back it ain't our fault that ya lost ya lil bitch
Ask ya boy bout them forty he lost
Talk slick Glock Forty ya boss now you the president
Fresher than peppermint whip tint till six

She really wanted more than love
He said that ain't real life

Trapped inside a little house
I feel a bit like Minnie Mouse
She says this ain't real life

And there it goes
Held inside a single note
Looking through a telescope
It never stops it never slows
All this time

Checking out and logging on
This is what I'm running on

Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now

Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?

K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die?

I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...


She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town


For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

I swear it's like I can't even leave my house

You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town


Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy!"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

Abre las alas, el mundo te espera
Una sorpresa que dios te guarda
Abre las manos, el cielo te guarda
Un regalito que es solo pa' ti


El verde de tu pelo
Y el azul de tu piel
El amor es un espejo
Donde nadie se ve


Cierra los ojos y mira tu alma
Una hojita en el árbol de amor
Abre los ojos y mira quien te ama
Una rama, rama, rama, rama


Tu dios es me diosa
No puede ser diferente
Uu, mi diosa es tu dios
No le pares a la gente




Mira el abasto cubrido de sangre
Te estaba buscando, pero no hay nadie
Mira el museo, fue destroza'o
Por gente que nunca había entra'o


Mira la fila, veinte mil horas
Ahí está mi tia esperando su pan
Que porcentaje de gente con hambre
Es necesario pa' que algo cambie


Ayer mi vecina fue secuestra'
Quería contarte, pero eso no es na'
Abre las manos, el mundo te espera

If I could write one letter
To the world as we know it
I would list these rhymes
That mean everything to me
Heartache temporary
Bullets only stop your blood
Pain will live on and on
In everyone, in everyone


And we could change

We could change the world
We could strike the chord

We could rewrite history
If only you and me

And we could change it down


The model holds no answers
His lips can only sway
Chemicals imbalance
Who needs them anyway?
Desire is close at hand
Her lips can only sway
There's more to life than this
Don't give yourself away
Don't give yourself away


And we could change

We could change the world
We could strike the chord

We could rewrite history
If only you and me

And we could change it down


Don't give yourself away
Don't give yourself away
Don't give yourself away


And we could change it down

We could change the world
We could strike the chord

We could rewrite history
If only you and me

We could change the world
If only you and me

"How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

I went up to the window
Lightning banging on the cymbals
I ripped into the night
Came storm into your eyes

My horse had worked the fields too long
My bear had lost his innate calm
It's true enough we're not at peace
But peace is never what it seems

Our love is not the light it was
When I walk inside the dark I'm gone
While we look for where it went
It's only echoes in the valley of love

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

We waste time on blame and weak revenge
Waste energy on projections
We're living proof we've gotta let go
And stop looking through the halo

We carry on as if the time is through
You carry on as if I don't love you
And so we find the way is out
To cut the heart out of the doubt now

The room's full but hearts are empty
Like the letters never sent me
Your words are like a lasso
But you're an instrumental tune

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

Take your time now don't you worry
Let me know what you're going through
There's a troubled look on your face
And it would only take the time
It takes, for me to talk to you
And now and then we've got to question
Am I right, I may be wrong
And the only way we can work it out
We've got to try to give and take
And it will only take the time
It takes for me to talk to you
But don't turn me away
Open up your eyes now
Making up will only take a minute
Don't turn me away
Listen what your heart say
Making up will only take a minute
Breaking up is hard to turn around
You can't be living in emptiness
You've been lonely too long
But don't go making me promises
When you know that you're wrong
You're not true
So when you find out where your heart is
Let me know
I'll be waiting for you
You and I don't have to hurry
Take your time now don't you worry
Let me know what you're going through
There's a troubled look on your face
And it would only take the time

Where the people are moving and grooving from dusk till dawn

Unique I am like a unicorn tonight
So good to be at a place

To the problems today
We should all go down to the light
They're so right, we’re so wrong, we like it

"She was a flower for the takin'
Her beauty cut just like a knife
He was a banker from Macon
Swore he'd love her all his life

Bought her a mansion on a mountain
With a formal garden and a lot a land

But paradise became her prison
That Georgia banker was a jealous man


Every time he'd talk about her
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say
I would walk through Hell on Sunday
To keep my Rose in Paradise

He hired a man to tend the garden
Keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say that gardener left alone

Now the banker is an old man
That mansion's crum-ble-ing down
He sits all day and stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found


Every time he talks about her
You can see the fire in his eyes
He'd say, ""I would walk through Hell on Sunday

Its beauty cuts just like a knife

And blooms in the dead of the night

And that little old log cabin in the lane

The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way

While her mamma cried
I kept the motor running
In my car outside
She kissed him on the cheek
Daddy's little girl
Then a woman walked out
To take on the world


Through red taillights
And a cloud of dust
We went flying through the night
It was all about us
Sitting on the seat right next to me
We drove with a tank full of destiny


She was born to run

Yeah, she was born to run
Born to run to me


With a new world waiting
Down the road up ahead
Passion running wild
Through our hearts and our heads
With everything we owned
Packed in the backseat
We had each other
That was all we'd need


They all called me crazy
Said she'd never settle down
I was just her ticket
Her ticket out of town
But it looks like that night
Fate proved 'em wrong
Because she's been mine
Mine all along


She was born to run

Yeah, she was born to run
Born to run to me, oh I


It's been years now
And I never doubted
Somewhere, somehow
We'd make through
She's still here
No two ways about it
Her heart's still mine
And her love's still true


She was born to run
Was the Master's plan
Born to run
Put her heart in my hand
Born to run born to run to me

I'm kicking right through this door
I stole your girl who was my girl
I always said she's a whore
Bust through, accelerate
From everything I hate
Now this is my kind of disaster
Break in and take what we want
And then burn down the liquor store
Pick up our friends tell them
""Let's all get in don't ask what it's for.""

Porn on the TV screen
These spinning rims don't go no faster

And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one

And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one


We're flipping off the people
Who dissed on us that's just our game
We're throwing bricks right through their windows
And then we drive away
Let's break this, spin around
New things are better found
We keep on changing our direction
Go past the school, the church
The places that caused us hurt, we're done
If we keep moving forward
Maybe we'll forget where we're from
We're gonna shake things up
We're gonna break you down
We'll fuel this car with our rejection

Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me


Come with me and in time we'll grow
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy


Boo, would ya die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
But when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county written letters, how I miss you
Givin' you credit, apologetic how I diss you
Kiss you for thinkin' like a mona and on a level
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dilation
For a total twine ya, we right behind ya true
Life just me and you, no tellin' what we could do
Gettin' high between the sheets, make the shit right here discrete
Puttin' hickeys on ya belly while we fuckin' on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy


Shorty I lend my hand out ta help ya, lost soul lookin' for shelter
On late night accept it, treat ya good, won't disrespect ya
My age is young, out of place bitch days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hun
Placed her under my wing, showed her how we swing
Now she rolling blunts for her king
One day labelled thug misses, the essence of my ghetto sisters
Hugs and kisses, that's just for me to be a father figure


 come with me and in time we'll grow
 Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
 Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
 Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain 
If ya trust me
 Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

Ha, hot damn, you look so appalled
My girl is the shit, your girl has no ass at all
Her booty super thick, but her tummy super small
And when she dancin', the booty swallow up her draws
Yeah buddy, in the club I do my Dougie
Bottle in my hand, mean muggin' like I'm ugly
Only models in my section, get them uglies 'way from me
And when they be like, I just play dummy
In the party got them white girls rollin' like whoa
In the mornin' they be like, ""Where the fuck are my clothes?
Please don't tell nobody cause I don't really do this""
Sure, what you think I'm stupid?
I told her just to call me dada
But shorty Spanish so she wanna call me papa, or papi
Never met a nigga like me
I swept her up, so I guess she had light feet


Can we make this an after party?
'Cause your body, all on me
And my heads spinnin' 'round and 'round
Can we make this a nasty party?
'Cause I just want your body on mine, body on mine
And take me down, take me down, down


Ha, look, Vans on, so I get my dance on
She said she fucked the whole crew, I put my mans on
I threw my money on the table, told her dance on it
I pulled that monster out, she put her hands on it
Pool party shawty goin' gnarly
Only fuck with rock stars and them boys who's ridin' Harleys
Bitch, I'm on your camera, no not iCarly
When she turn 21, I'ma drown her with Bacardi
Mmhm, one-fifty-one
Heart beatin' like a drum and my face is kinda numb
Stop that shit, where the hatin' comin' from?
Oh. you mad 'cause I got your girl face full of ***?


Can we make this an after party?

And I feel the drugs infecting me

Cold words, demands

You're living, barely breathing


Embrace the Dead
Raise your hands
To the gods in the sky
That let you breathe tonight

You sell yourself so cheap
Sleep with the night to carry on

All you 'get back, coming to the stage'
Is a girl who's new in town
She go by the name 'Where Your Stacks At?'
This pretty little thing, I swear, won't let you down
Watch her drop it like,  hey!

Pre Chorus 
Then she picked it up and pop it, everybody want's it
Facial, legendary. Body is iconic
No way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile
The music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile


Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile


She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch her drop it like,  hey!

Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...


As soon as I walked up in, I need some oxygen
First thing I noticed is shorty's been doing squats again
So bring them boxes in, let them know wer're some bosses
We're tossing them dollars often, no tithing, it's just the offering
She don't be hot for them, don't even want to talk to them
They pull up in the parking lot, she spots them by their moccasins
She's on the clock again, her work ethic is wild
The music gets her to dance, but the money makes her smile

I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, ""Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see""
I said ""won't you let me see""
I said ""won't you let me see
Your naked body?""

""Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I will let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said ""No you cannot see""
She said ""No you cannot see
My naked body""

So we're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
The balloons and paper streamers they're floating down on us
She says, ""You've got a minute left to fall in love""
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body
Naked body

Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion


A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion


Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright 
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion 
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion


A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's mama to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
‘Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just 20-some-odd years, I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
‘Cause, like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
‘Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings, in thug's mansion


Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good 
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion


Dear mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion


Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy

Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

You know
Check
Its akon man, my man P
Its the magic city baby
Yo i think we got one on this one

So all them haters, wanna scream my name? 
And they wouldn't support us before but wanna scream now? 
We gonna let them just keep on calling baby , just keep calling 
And for our supporters, you know you can just keep calling as long as you want 

I used to be up on the corner all day, tryin to figure out whats gonna get me out there
Dope dealing and hugging the block, i done found out ain't gonna get me nowhere
Used to keep a nine milli for protection, just in case a nigga wanna take my bread
Then the voice came down from the sky and said...Akon use your head..

I had to re-evaluate my thoughts and think about what Got me this far,
Had to keep a strong faith and believing, know one day I'd be a star 
But I knew that it wouldn't come easy
Seen a whole lotta hate and believe me 
Despite all the bullshit we had to still work hard, to get to where we are

So when you hear them calling out ""Akon"", let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out ""P-money"", let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling

Senegal West Africa to New Zealand 
Blessed to have the gift to make music with meaning 
Cause i never thought i'd come this far, with a mansion and a fancy car
Never thought success would come this quick in the beggining 

And all along I'm sitting there thinking that its harder when you came from the hood 
When all I had to do was put my mind to it, and realise that it was all good 
Cause once i got rid of what held me down, best believe I won't be turning back
I had to keep on moving and to keep on grooving right here on this P-Money track
And so

When you hear them calling out ""Akon"" Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out ""P-Money"" Let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling

Keep on calling, keep on calling, just keep on calling, keep on calling
Just keep on calling, keep on calling, just keep on calling, keep on calling

When you hear them calling out ""Akon"" Let them keep on calling
When you hear the world calling out ""P-Money"" Let them keep on calling
Cause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling
Let me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling

I was listening to the sound of the waves breaking
And I thought of all the words that they were whispering
And it kept changing
I was standing in the midst of a great company
Listening to the voices in ecstasy
And I watched as all creation was sang into being
And it kept changing
And it was changing

And all at once I caught a pulse and felt a rhythm
And I thought of the song of the ages
Then the balance slipped and opened up the season
And I felt like raging

I was staring at the clouds, the rain began to fall softly
Filling up the rivers in Texas
And I thought of you and maybe you once thought of me
We were changing
And we kept changing

And all at once I saw a hole into the future
And I thought of the bells of creation
I heard the voice of God coming in the music

But don't you know that the devil is a liar? 
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher


Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves


Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher 

But don't you know that the devil is a liar? 

They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher 



Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate 
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day 
And look at my fate


Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher 

But don't you know that the devil is a liar? 
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher


Higher
Oh, Lord
Can you feel it?
My shoes are scrapin' the sky
I'm so high
We keep goin' higher

Get it, touch right there, babe
I ain't scared, I'm down 
All I need is one time, one time
For me to go down  and eat it like it's lunchtime
I'm in a four-door 
Polo, them horses 
But you roll up in a four-door 
In the mirror, she gorgeous
Red light, nigga, waiting for that green light 
Baby, get your head right, follow me to that east side
I fuck with some real niggas
The belly of the beast all day, V.A
You know that we all deal wishing
Then I pop up the pussy in your face, fillet
After party, got bank 
Got that bomb ass sushi, call that ass to the sink 
Stop acting like it ain't
And it's a violation, three seconds in the paint
Woah, oh
Oh girl, I really fuck with ya
Oh, oh
Girl, I think I'm in love with ya
That one girl, I only seen on my way, yeah
It's a straight shot to the crib, no chaser


One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
Straight shot to the crib, straight shot to the crib 
Take shots, take shots, take shots, we don't waste shots
Take shots, take shots, take shots, to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib


Okay, let me bust on the bullet, automatic, call it pump
Straight shots, caught made shots in the Maybach
Throwin' up the OHB 'cause we out here ballin'
And we still getting paid, buck
I elevate and get rich, VVS flow
Cuttin' through the diamonds like a fuckin' laser
Pow, pow, look at the crowd
Said I wasn't shit, nigga, look at me now
Gon' put it on wax, try to figure me out
Random selectin' the lineup, she pickin' me out
It's 'cause I'm a black guy and she a white girl
No, I did not have my dick in her mouth
I'm busy bein' the life of the motherfuckin' party
Private jets, private sex, private departures
The money ain't a thing, I don't care 'bout an offer
But I'm 'bout put the pussy right up in the coffin, let's go


One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
Straight shot to the crib, straight shot to the crib

You like snow but only if it's warm
You like rain but only if it's dry


There's no sentimental value to the rose
That fell on your floor
No fundamental excuse
For the granted I'm taken for


Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around
Never comes around to you
To you


You like pain but only if it doesn't hurt too much
And you sit, and you wait, to receive


There's an obvious attraction
To the path of least resistance, in your life
There's an obvious aversion
No amount of my insistence could make you try tonight


Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around
Never comes around to you
To you, to you
To you, to you
To you


There's no love
No money
No thrill anymore


There's an apprehensive naked little trembling boy
With his head in his hands
And there's an underestimated and impatient little girl
Raising her hand


But it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you, to you


Get up, get up, get up off of it
Get up, get up, get up off of it
Get out, get out of here, enough already
Get up, get up, get up off of it
Wake up

"Saturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun came without warning
So no-one knew what to do

Saturday sun brought people and faces
That didn’t seem much in their day
But when I remembered those people and places
They were really too good in their way

In their way
In their way
Saturday sun won’t come and see me today

Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people in their season and time
Returning again and again

And again
And again

But Saturday’s sun has turned to Sunday’s rain
So Sunday sat in the Saturday sun

And wept for a day gone by

",['Folk']
"It's time for you to go...!
Breathing in and breathing out
My head leaned back my hands are tied
I stand in here alone I scream, questions why
Days slip by and nights I taste
These memories run through my veins
Injecting me with one last kiss, screaming why

This medication, can't save me
And desperation, takes hold of me
I wanted to believe in all of this
And I wanted to believe in you 

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here

Determination, is pushing me
Perseverance, is what I bleed
I wanted to believe in all of this
And I wanted to believe in you 

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here

These are my unanswered prayers
The time has come for me to say goodbye

God please hear me, calling

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here
Never bring me back here again
Never bring me back

These are my unanswered prayers
The time has come for me to say goodbye

God please hear me, calling

Born of his Spirit, washed in his blood

Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

‘Cause you know the Fergenstein gettin' plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shinin' in the Benzo
Ballin', got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer, then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the building, semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they gettin' on my nerves
I ain't lyin', lay 'em on the curb
Ridin' on a killer who be comin' at Ferg

He shot me, so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten homis on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby, don't pray for me, pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies


Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

All big titties lift your shirt
Show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front of the church
Deacon said I did my shit
The pastor said, ""That nigga turnt""
Pop my collar on my shirt
Make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units; Captain Kirk
Takin' xannies, poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb you first
Turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth
Had to give Young Ferg a verse


A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Outta line, pistols barkin' , ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it
Be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress
Side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic

E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito

Volare, oh oh...
Cantare, ohohoho...
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

E volavo, volavo felice

Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva, lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me

Quando tramonta, la luna li porta con sé

You bought a star in the sky tonight
Because your life is dark and it needs some light
You named it after me, but I’m not yours to keep
Because you’ll never see, that the stars are free


Oh we don’t own our heavens now
We only own our hell
And if you don’t know that by now
Then you don’t know me that well


All my life I’ve been so lonely
All in the name of being holy
Still, you’d like to think you know me
You keep buyin’ stars
And you could buy up all of the stars
But it wouldn’t change who you are
You’re still living life in the dark
It’s just who you are
It’s just who you are


You bought a star in the sky tonight
And in your man-made dark
The light inside you died


Oh we don’t own our heavens now
We only own our hell
And if you don’t know that by now
Then you don’t know me that well


All my life I've been so lonely
All in the name of being holy
And still, you'd like to think you own me
You keep buying stars
And you could buy up all the stars
But it wouldn't change who you are
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are
It's just who you are


You know only how to own me
You know only how to own me
You’re buying stars to shut out the light
We come alone and alone we die

"Natural corruption

Another day passed by in ruined paradise
Another night will pass until we're sheltered
We're aiming for a life that won't be compromised
And when we say goodbye it's devastating

Now that we have finally realized
Realized, petrified
That profit's made from innocent demise
Profit's made from tragic demise

Another day goes by where money won't suffice
A massive gift was meant as contribution
Our conscience comes to aid that ends up in wrong hands
And once the truth's revealed, intent is fading

Now that we have come to realize
Realized, sanctified
Our hearts subdued by all those thousand cries
Hearts subdued by all those fierce cries

In moments of deadly gloom
Young lives ended way too soon
The facts that are all untrue
Spread lies that wew not thought through

Fight off the catastrophes
Find true inned sanctity
In modern society
Welfare is stained, time to come clean again

Feast on sheer agone
Lean on generosity
Pay in full, it all will vanish without care
Grant us higher proceeds

We'll ease your mind, guaranteed
We should all be reaching out to the despaired

Natural corruption
Charity

Can you believe it
How nature's left its trace
Could we foresee it
What skies erased

We all are trying
We all are dying in nature's arms...

In moment of deadly gloom
Youg lives ended way too soon
The facts that are all untrue
Spread lies that were not thought through

Fight off the catastrophes
Find true inner sanctity
In modern society
Nothing to hide, lives to obtain
Welfare is stained, time to come clean again

I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you found the answer
Told me to take this chance

You got, rich niggas right
They do what they wanna do
Heh, and you got
Broke niggas, you heard?
They do what they gotta do
Now ask yourself, which one are you?
Ha, fall back


Soakin in Remy, sittin back smokin a twenty
Shit is scabby, the hustlin is so in me
Never show envy, got a style I maxed
I'm like po', back in eighty-fo', now smile at that
Unseen when I'm low, but still right in your face
I'm so skinny, but that semi-auto's right in my waist
From Jags to Jeeps, hoopties with the raggedy seats
Just imagine how I'm movin if we had any beef
Beats relax me, good cheeba keeps me nasty
Lower the smoke when I see the D's creepin past me
Duckin the NARCs, born bustin Dutches apart
Love pussy wit pretty lips, when you fuck it it fart
Friend or foe, freak for the rims that glow
Rock Timbs if it's summer or ten below
Love the streets, the science of the drugs that's deep
I'm just another nigga next up, tryin to eat




You know!
Not a soul baby!
It's all for y'all now


But it seems, y'all would rather
See me hit than, see my rich
Get bagged over some bullshit and see me snitch
Hopin' some AIDS ho bitch'll leave me sick like
I'm a sucker for love wit some easy dick
I did dirt through my days but hid my work
Even then I still made sure no kids got hurt
Sweep the next, been knowin since my feet got wet
From the best turned vet learned to speak direct
My game's jumpin, we all had our days of barkin
You could tell niggas styles by they ways of parkin
Why dispute it? Dough got us so polluted
Paranoid to the point it's like we, over-do it
Police press up, peep how the beasts arrest ya
Rough up, handcuff, then treat you lesser
Toast on me, smoke spray our potpouri
Y'all can bet I'mma rep how it's supposed to be




You know!
Not a soul baby!
It's all for y'all now
I got it locked, feel me!


Infinite game, get chills on the strength of my chain
It's only real, certain niggas mention my name
Some relate, others stay numb in the face
Tryin to keep steps ahead like we runnin a race
Nikes and Timbs, lady friends like 'em slim
Light makeup, that shit that blend right wit they skin
So what's the issue? All dick sucks is still official
Cold-steel nickles, and Phil I'm still with you
Iceberg-in, on the Turnpike mergin
Late night, right brake lights black Excursion
Tree smokin, hustle the rap I'mma keep ropin
Too many niggas got deep emotions
The stress got 'em, who else wanna express they problems?
Get upset, but real vets respect the bottom
To a false, feel a fake love or hate
Right or wrong as long as the thugs relate




You know!
Not a soul baby!
It's all for y'all now
What y'all want from me?




Yeah, y'all haters better get a hustle man, stop fuckin wit me

I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test


So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
""I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart
To ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me


I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test


So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word
""We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe""
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
""I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right""
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow


And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live

Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living just because He lives




And then one day, I'll cross that river
I'll fight life's final, final war with pain
And then, as death gives way to victory

Come however you are
Just come, come alone
Come with friends, come with foes
Come however you are

Just come, come alone
Come with me, then let go
Come however you are
Just come, come alone

Come with sorrows and songs
Come however you are

Feet in the water
Feels safe so let it go
Throw on a record
Feels good so let it flow


When my feet hit the H20
I might say that it's way too cold to dive in
I'm striving I swear
But I'd rather you float me in
Come and go with me
You got a show to see
And I'm singing
Come and talk to me

A little Marco Polo ain't hurt nobody
Eyes closed, you gotta listen to find me
When you get what I'm spitting you get me
A+ for the written assignment
Footprints in the water at our secret little swimming pool
Waving like a pro cause I've been learning since like middle school


Feet in the water
Feels safe so let it go
I got the kindle
I know where we can go
Feels good so let it flow
Throw on a record
Feels good so let it flow


I want my feet up in the water
Telling me to let it go
I wonder who you're swimming with when I'm not around
Can  calm it down
I'm all up in this water
You telling me to dive in
I wonder what it is about myself that gets you wet
I wonder if it wasn't  swims

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost...

ברוך אתה ה' א‑לוהינו, מלך העולם, אשר קדשנו...‏

Hail Mary, full of Grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women...

Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep, if I die before I wake...

Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy Kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil
Amen

Who is God? Well, it's an invisible person, and he lives up in heaven, up there

God is somebody who rules the world. He's sort of like a spirit, I guess up in outer space

He kind of started all the plants growing, and he started people. Well I guess he's kind of big and fat

He can see us whatever we do, whatever we do, he has such powerful eyes, he has to have millions and thousands and billions, and he can still see us when we're bad

He could be sitting on the table right now, but you can't see him

If he was a bad man, he would make everything bad, and we wouldn't have electricity, he wouldn't make people, that's what would happen if God wasn't nice

He's not though, what - a lot of people think he's just a feeling - but I think he's a real person...

Well, I think that God, um, isn't a person, but he's up in the heavens, and he's watching over us right now

"When I first saw Yvonne, volcanoes erupted
And her laughter flowed into my life
She seemed so right, nothing wrong
Everything about her was so strong
So I waited for the magic to start
Somebody touch me deep in my heart

Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, ""Hold on
You're not the only one""
And so I said, ""You're wrong Yvonne""

But I didn't dare let it show
Her ruby lips were teasing me
But jealousy would never let us be
So I waited for the magic to start
But I know it's gonna tear us apart

She said, ""Hold on
You're not the only one""

She'll never know how much I loved her
I never got to tell
We never had the chance to say farewell

She was covered in roses
But the laughter had gone from her eyes
She walked so tall, looked so grand
Everything about her truly planned
But what you get is not what you see
""So long Yvonne you're not fooling me""

The old colonel was a veteran
Each night he'd take his medicine
And stay up watchin’ Letterman
Trying to forget
The things he saw when he was young
The carnage and the sound of guns
He kept his pain from everyone
With the ink inside his pen


The colonel kept a journal of his troubles and regrets
His battles were internal, raging wars inside his head
'Til the end, he was a soldier
'Cause the fight was never over
The colonel kept a journal and he left it in a box
Buried in the basement underneath some dirty socks
’Til the end, he was a soldier
'Cause the fight was never over


And the day he died, his kids flew in
Took some time just to remember him
They cleaned up his old medicine
As everybody wept
They were packing up the cellar
When they found his diary, read it and
Couldn't believe the things he said
With the ink inside his pen

As the last I spend regretting what I have


Boys, raise your glasses
Girls, shake those-

We're the party, you're the people
Let's make this night a classic
We play, you move

We're the party, you're the people
And this is how we, this is how we do


The curtain's rising, I'm forgetting where I've been
I watch the lights go up on a star without his screen
Set it off and say it back
Direction's keeping me on track
But I'll admit, I do it all for the attention


I'm just a face for every picture
A smile for your scrapbooks
And a story to be told 
But I'm loving every second
So commemorate this hour
As the last I spend regretting what I have


Boys, raise your glasses
Girls, shake those-

We're the party, you're the people
Let's make this night a classic
We play, you move

We're the party, you're the people
And this is how we, this is how we do

When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
They much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you're so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides nobody can be that wise


I can't help you if you won't help yourself
I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else 
I can't help you if you won't help yourself


You got a degree in philosophy
So you  think you cleverer than me 
But I'm not just some drama queen
Cause its where you're at, not where you've been
So what do you expect from me 
To hold your head above the sea 
And carry you, even though you bigger
Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we still so young 
And this isn't yesterday


I can't help you if you won't help yourself
I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else 
I can't help you if you won't help yourself



You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most of the time
And I, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knew

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl


Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye


Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere I would've followed you

Say something, I'm giving up on you

Give it up for the paris as well we are a huge fan

Ooh...


She still remembers a time that was uncomplicated
But sure as the sun rise she's seen things that you'll never see
Losses and heartache amount to her strength
But oh, how they both take their toll


She's still here fighting
Better know there's life in her yet


Time will take us all, and turn us into stones
It leaves us with regrets and picks apart the threads
Hung over fragile bones


Let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go


Her hands tell the story of hardships that we'll never know
Her face is a map of a lifetime on well traveled roads
But those eyes tell nothing of a soul that is spared
A heart that is longing for death


She's still here fighting
Better know there's life in her yet


Time will take us all, and turn us into stones
It leaves us with regret, it picks apart the threads
Hung over fragile bones

This is the Witching Hour


I can see the way you look at me
You can’t see beyond the veil
I can tell the way you run from me
I’m not your perfect fairy tale


Watch me burn
Can you feel me
Watch as I turn
What do you see



Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames

Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith
This is the Witching Hour






Don’t you see the way I look at you
I can see behind your eyes
Can’t you tell the way I reach for you
I wear my halo in disguise


I watch you burn
I can feel you
I watch as you turn
What did you do



Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames

Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith
This is the Witching Hour


You must burn for what you have done
You must burn for what you have done
You must burn for what you’ve become
You must burn


Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames
Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour

I fell in love with a girl from Petit Valley
She have a tough life but she pretty smiley
We join carnival for the finale
But I want to move to Trinidad keep her happy
Cause she got deported for five years
I swear to God I almost shed a tear when she told me that shit
So I'm back in New York and we talk on the phone
She tell me that she want me back can I keep it at home
I got a growing career can't just leave it alone
It's either her curly hair or the microphone
Girl, oh, what you want me to do?

Saw Jim Reid in the corridor
And I wondered if he could ever see me that way
He was on my list at the grocery store
When you grabbed my wrist and said you liked my keychain
Read your feature in the weekly paper
And honestly, I found it a little bit bloated
Friday, we fell through the coffee table
And that’s when I discovered that my heart exploded
How? How?


You’re a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You’re a lollipop in my hair
But I’m a gumdrop
Am I ever gonna fit that mould?
'Cause I don’t have the patience to wait in line for you


When I came back to apologize
You asked me if I was intrigued by LSD
I sat next to you on the picnic bench
And before I knew it, you were flying next to me
I met your baby at the exposition
And frankly, I found it a little unnerving
I let you know when we were driving home
And all I can remember is the fact that we're swerving


You’re a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You’re a lollipop in my hair
How could I ever obtain you?
But you’re a doorstop
When you’re lying on the bathroom floor
And I don’t have the time to wait in line for you
How could I ever betray you?


Alter my state to get through this date
You're alone in this picture
And it swallows me whole
Alter my state to get through this date
You're alone in this picture

Alter my state to get through this date
You're alone in this picture
Alter my state to get through this date
And it swallows me whole
You're alone in this picture

How could I ever obtain you?
In the form of a lightning bolt
You’re a lollipop in my hair
How could I ever betray you?
You look like Iggy Pop
Circa ’73 or ‘4
How could I ever obtain you?
Because I don’t have the time wait in line for you
How could I ever betray you?

Well there was a man, lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained he felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad


Well there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her, his shed to mend
She said I’m sorry you’ll just have to find a friend


Well this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes, and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don’t think I’m not your sort
You’ll find that sheds are nicer than you thought

I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah


When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look to the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?


Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak

Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?


As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""
If there's a God why has He let me go?

As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away


Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

There's a storm across the valley
Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon is heavy
On your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane
A mile or more away
And the whining of his wheels
Just makes it colder


He's an hour away from riding
On your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road
Are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning
Supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes
That makes him warm


Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again


There's all the news to tell him
How'd you spend your time
What's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday
Sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday


Hey, it's good to be back home again, yes it is
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again


And all the time that I can lay this tired, old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for
The love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me


It's the sweetest thing I know of
Just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm

Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

If there's a full moon hangin' high
You can bet there's a jacked up four wheel drive
Cruisin' with the crew with a beer on ice
Lookin' for the girls that'll let their hair down
Lead us on, get us thinkin' they might
Share a little sugar on a Friday night
Makin' midnight memories lightin' up the sky
In the country side we turn it up loud


Down here we keep the good times flowin'
Red dirt flyin', and the radio goin'
We got each other's back and everybody knows it
Yeah, me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up
Like me and my down home boys


We're tighter than the tops we twist off
When the sun goes down and the work day's gone
Like somethin' straight out of a country song
Raised up all farm tan tough
With the scuffs all over our boots
Little rough tangled up in our roots
Yeah, we got a little soft side too
When the girls get us all wrapped up


Down here we keep the good times flowin'
Red dirt flyin', and the radio goin'
We got each other's back and everybody knows it
Yeah, me and my down home boys

Ain't nobody gonna live this life up

Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed


Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying

As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been


Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir


Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh

About the man that I’ve become
About the days and days and days gone by
And the night still yet to come

When all’s said and done
Our future’s looking brighter than the sun

By the way love stays today
By the facts that they portray
In a lover’s gaze today

And she got a couple friends she could bring too
I'ma beat it up, like a bongo
And I've a feeling like she deep off in the Congo

"I was lost in a reverie
Your senses designed
For a touch of humanity
A whisper divine

I was forced, pulled out from the great divide
My sanity remade
Like a memory from the other side
Where the radiance never fades

Every single moment is forever
Every little touch is all for you
Our spirits will define
A journey unified

Every single moment lasting
Solitude to sanctity for life
The journey will define
Our spirits unified

I was longing in agony
My road was always long
You created it absently
And so it made me strong

I can flee through the shades
Dance away the rain
When I feel your presence flame
I was long in the dark and I wondered how
Can I ever be the same?

Every single moment is forever
Every little touch is all for you
Our spirits will define
A journey unified

Every single moment lasting
Solitude to sanctity for life
The journey will define
Our spirits unified

Forever unified
From silent seclusion I was made to see
When the final curtain falls I'm not afraid
So let our souls combine
Forever unified

Every single moment is forever
Every little touch is all for you

You like how it feels
Round and round till you lose yourself in the air

All those complicated deals
Your desperate appeals
Calling out to a god you know isn't there

So high as you fell looking down on the tops of the trees
And all you can do is say
Please, please, baby please

You were conjuring that year
A ghost engineer
Building gods who could put the clock in reverse

Breathing thinner atmosphere
So thin you could hear
Angels telling you boy, you're making it worse

So high as you fell looking down on the tops of the trees
And all you can do is say
Please, please, baby please

Please give me height
Spirals or spite
Falling or flight, the boosters ignite

So high as you fell looking down on the tops of the trees
So high
And all you can do is say
Please, please, baby please

It's been a long time
I guess I just miss the old days
You remember...all them times


You used to come keep me company
Tell me you love me and just me
Oh and it took a while to trust me
Girl I had to work for it
Still you don't judge me
I love the way you touch me
I'm feeling like I'm 'bout to lose you
With all the shady shit I do to you
Some things are better left unsaid
I can't get it out my head
Better left unsaid
Everything that I regret
No lie girl when I tell you, you a blessing 
Girl just let me make corrections, yeah
Damn, I've been stressing yeah
I've been really tripping babe
I learned my lesson, yeah
I still need you to listen, oh babe


Listen to me yeah
Oh if you'd just let me explain
If you'd just let me explain
Baby, oh 
Listen to me yeah, yeah
Oh if you'd just let me explain
If you'd just let me explain
Baby, oh
Yeah for sure
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid


Don't be afraid to tell me that it's over
Tell me that it's over
No, I don't deserve you, the shit I never told you
There's too many things, I can't look you in the face
I just grab you by the waist and act like everything's okay
Bare with me girl, I'm trying to be honest
Tell you what you need to hear, just not yet
I'm barely getting started, I'm being cautious
Girl that's the hardest
All we been through, look what we've been through
Look at Jay and Bey, they going through some shit too
We made it through the struggle let's make it through this too
I got a confession, baby will you listen to it?


Listen to me yeah 
Oh if you'd just let me explain 
If you'd just let me explain 
Baby oh 
Listen to me yeah 
Oh if you'd just let me explain 
Baby oh
Yeah

"Did you ever?
Not so much, that you could notice
Could you estimate how many?
8 or 9
Will you do it anymore?
As soon as you walk out the door
Well I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time

Could I fix you once more?
No thanks I just had one
Then how about a nice big..
That would be just fine
Is there any special way
No, whatever you say
Well I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time

Does he look like
NO he taller and more handsome
Yeah but he is old
Oh no he's young and he's in his prime
Does your father know? I'll bet
Uh huh.. I haven't told him yet
Well I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time

But just for old times sake
That will be much harder
Then how about
Well are you sure you don't mind
Hey, I know just thing for us
No, I'm afraid I'll miss my bus
Well, I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time

"
Oh, well, I love ya pretty baby
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne


Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin we can call our own


Well, I'm moving after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I'd do without it
Without this love that we call ours


Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin but the moon and stars


Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby
For as long as love will last


Beyond here lies nothin
But the mountains of the past


Well, my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me, pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head


Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin done, and nothin said

"He was a guy who had no education
He never learned to love and now he hates society
He never had somebody who would listen
He never had a friend that he could talk to when he's down

He has to suffer mental discomposure
He never learned to pay, he's only taking what he needs
His only friends are hate and violation
To get arrested some day is his only destination

Too late the damage's done is everything you hear
And when you're dead and gone nobody cries a tear

Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger, living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose

He's hating light
He loves to live in shadows
Where he can hide his fears
When he is crying secret tears
He's hating light
He loves to hide in darkness
Where he can hide his feelings and emotions
His enemies

Too late the damage's done is what they always say
You never get your chance you lose it anyway

Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger just like living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose

You never had the chance to prove
That you’re a man full of emotions
You only learned how to survive
In your environment of darkness
You build a fortress 'round your soul

Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger, just like living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose

Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
‘Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human being
So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
‘Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly? Somebody else should try
Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies


We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
‘Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
But we ain't, its grain to go against
With every artist comes the image he portrays
And the picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you heard me say I'm a gangster
And I ain't hear no complaints
But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search, but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive
 And we continue growin', one day at a time


Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and lights
Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
And the kids think beef is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of Kadaf' while Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains the same


I spend my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
And hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt
Yeah, that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself
No matter how much I try, stay alive
I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride


Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ASCAP
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realize that we're not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
 And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn

"I can remember the times
When I used to cry
And then I saw a man one day
And he didn't have no eyes

The police gave me a ticket
It made me mad as hell
When I went to pay my fine
A man got six months in jail

I'm doing fine
Lord, I'm doing fine, fine, fine
After all, yeah, yeah

Just because you couldn't buy me a steak
It put me in a bad mood

You see I'm doing fine

Stand up, here we go
1 to the 1 to the 6 fa sho
Bump this in your car
But turn it up inside your stereo
..
Spitting for the folks that you know in every city bro
Billy Graham man, pray to God they can hear me tho
Realy tho, I just came to tell you don't be scurred
Preach the word everywhere you go and let the truth be heard
And you ain't gotta be a rapper but you gotta tell the truth
Scream it from your mama house or from your project ..
Chi-town to the Lou, Memphis Ten to the ..
Dallas, Houston, Indiana, Oklahoma need it too
It's the power of salvation Jesus put us out Himself
Put our sin upon His shoulders told us tell somebody else
Now we die to ourselves, stop lying to ourselves
Ain't ashamed to share the gospel, put our pride on the shelf
We don't ride for the wealth but we ride for change
In the heart and not the pocket man to die is to gain


State to state, city to city
Block to block and hood to hood
Catch us outside everywhere we go
Trying to tell these folks what's good
The good news, some call it the gospel
Some folks embrace it, others get hostile
But earth is cursed man, heaven is perfect
If we can clown for Christ man believe me it's worth it
We stand up for the power of purchase
Worthless, without our God's plan is the purpose
It's getting heavy now, I think they ready now
Stand up, man up, hands up
Get it crunk, but keep it steady now
In it to win it now, man they done did it now
Spit it for the cats ..
When the goal is Christ, then live it out


What it do, let me bring up Romans 1:16
It's more than the clique I claim, it's the reason I'm redeemed
 Ain't ashamed of the gospel of Christ
It's the power that crossed our souls out of death into light
Holla 1-1-6, cause we once was sick
Christ bought us even though we wasn't worth one cent
Yea the curse was sin but the earth got sent
A Redeemer Who paid for all of the earth's worse sin
Now the worse per-son can repent and be changed
That's why we never ashamed of the truth we proclaim
It's the light on the dark path, only way out of death
It's the answer to every question people got on their chest
People gotta address the crucial nature of sin
What that got to do with us man?
We tell them Christ is where they begin
That's why I'm screaming stand up
Know you got your hands up
Now it's time to represent like the Father commands us

"Verse 1 -  2pac 

They finally did it 
They stole the mic i grip
Now that it's gone 
I'm feelin' tired and sick
 I don't know I wasn't sleepin that long
When i woke up 
My Microphone was gone
First I panicked 
I put the cops on the case
But they was stumped 
Without a clue or a trace
So as sure as smoking cigarettes is bad for your health
If i want my microphone back i'll find it my self
So I picked up the phone 
I called Dizzy 
My Mic's gone 

Before I told Dizzy what I wanted to do
He was over at my house with the TMS crew
He said 
And then it hit me 
I got a battle at 6
With out my microphone
I'm guaranteed to get whipped
Ya might think its unbelievable
But word to the strength
When it comes to rockin rhymes
Im a musical nymph
They gave me other mics
But yo it wasn't no use
I tried to rock it 
But I couldn't get loose
I said forget it
Ya microphone or not
And I got to do this
Give it all that I got 
It'd be the first time I lost
But if I beat 'em it'd finally prove that I'm the boss
I grabbed my leather jacket
Walked through the streets
Was hopin and payin
Strictly dope won't get beat
I begin to get hyped
I was ready to fight
Yo I was confident that I win
To hell with the mic!
I hop on to the stage
Dizzy started the beat
The sucka shivered
Because he tasted defeat
Then I signaled to Dizzy
Bust a rhyme wit my head
Perpetrator fell back 
And then he was dead
I was happy as hell
Cause I was lucky that night
Put my hand in my pocket
And there was my mic
Haha


The case of the misplaced mic

Verse 2 2pac 

I'm down with Strictly Dope
 That means I'm more than you can handle
 I'm hotter than the wax from a candle
 That's Rock T he's my microphone companion
 Full of knowledge truth and understandin'
 Rappin' is my only recreation
 Ya must be on some kind of medication
 Cuz I'll never loosin up my mic grip
 Never cuz i'm livin on the right tip
 Only with my girl becasue I love her
 Impossible I always use a rubber
 Rarely cause I'm keepin' myself busy
 Nah, I leave the cuttin' up to Dizzy

"Now Old Dan Tucker was a fine old man
Washed his face in a frying pan
Combed his hair with a wagon wheel
And died with a toothache in his heel

Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

Now Old Dan Tucker come to town
Riding a billy goat, leading a hound
The hound dog barked and billy goat jumped
And landed old Tucker on a stump

Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper
Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

Now Old Dan Tucker got drunk and fell
In the fire and kicked up holy hell
A red-hot coal got in his shoe
And oh my Lord, the ashes flew

Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

"Io mi domando come mai
È da un po' di tempo che non ti penso
Mi domando come mai
Non capisco cosa in noi
Oramai non ha più senso
Non capisco come mai
Io mi domando se davvero
Ho bisogno di una donna
O se sto più bene solo
Mi domando se l'amore
È nelle pieghe di una gonna
O se è sparso per il cielo
Tu non guardarmi come fai
Spegni subito il tuo odio
Non c'è colpa e tu lo sai
Ma non ti senti un po' anche tu
Chiusa dentro ad un armadio
Sii sincera come sei

Io mi domando come mai
Ho nel cuore l'infinito
Dove non si muore mai
Ho capito dentro me
Non c'è un volto disegnato
Eppure tu nel centro sei
Averti credimi è per me
Una gran soddisfazione
Amar di più io non potrei
Però rinchiuso dentro te
Farei la fine di un leone
Su una poltrona a bere il thè

Io mi domando come mai
Ho nel cuore l'infinito
Dove non si muore mai
Ho capito dentro me
Non c'è un volto disegnato

And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty

Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryna keep a nigga down, but shit fails

Built the bullshit sense of pride inside of me
On a rise to fly car hating on varieties

Get caught, you better stick to the codes that you provided, b

But sometimes you need money to see who you cool with

I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working spitting hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasing up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile


Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide


It ain't where
It's how you live
We weren't raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And all Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive

" Let me tell you about my city little homie
That's if you ain't read where they practice black
Magic and speak to the dead
Minds fried like bleach to the head
From the stuff being preached by the Greeks if you read
Our main attraction is our main distraction/
Thanks for asking
Actually I can't stand her
Who is she she draws every man
And every woman from every land
To her temple of Diana
She's regarded as a sacred goddess
One of the 7 wonders of the world
It's obvious that Christlessness in my city to worship a many-breasted mummy-looking girl
Under the Romans my city is free so you can only imagine that's going on
That's why us believers here in Ephesus have no choice but cling to the throne

When we got the letter from Paul my dawg was locked in chains
This was the means by which the doctrine came
It was the teaching explaining the gospel main
From the Apostle Paul written to all the saints
In Ephesus 
He started off wit some definitions explicitly written for Christians
He made it plain it wasn't a plan B
He predestined to a portion some of humanity
Through His own Son
For His own glory
Through His Son's blood
 said he was praying for us
That our eyes will see the hope of the call
The riches of glory His inheritance He has is us all 
Said we are saved by grace through faith
Faith's a gift  so faith through grace
In light of that we shouldn't live like we used too
It's crucial that we don't do
What we used to do 

It blessed our hearts to read
How God revealed to Paul this mystery
How we were far from God with no peace 
We can't lie dawg we been foul
Cats might even know us as Gentiles
In other words we are not Jewish
We'd still be dead in our sin if God did not do this
Tear down the wall between Jews and Gentiles
Praise God now I can be His child 
Now we can walk in unity with no beef
And keep the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace 
And share our gifts as we edify one another
No harsh jokin being corrupt lying on each other
Putting off the old man and putting on the new 
In our marriages 
Families 
Even on our jobs 
The new nature affectin every area of our lives/
The whole armor is applied cause we're soldiers for God

Even though I'm trying so damn hard
I'm trying so hard


This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away
And I won’t duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I'm already here


Oh, no, I am already here
Down on my knees
I am already here 
I'm already here
I must have told you a thousand times
I'm not running away


I won’t duck and run
I won’t duck and run
I won’t duck and run
No, I won't pass away


This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away
And I won’t duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I'm already here

"Mother, what will Thomas, the old gardener say
When you ask him for flowers for me?
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care?
The fairest, fairest broom on the tree

What will the birds do, mother, in the spring?
Will they gather the crumbs around our door?
Will they fly from the trees and tap at my window
Asking why Joe wanders out no more?

What will the kitten do, mother, all alone?
Will he stop from his frolic for a day?
Will he lie on the rug by the side of my bed
As he did before I went away?

I've seen tears come in his honest eyes
But he said it was the wind that brought 'em there
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler everyday
His hand trembled over my hair

Keep Tag, mother, my poor little dog
I know he will mourn for me too
Keep him in old and unless he grows
Sleeping all along summer through

Show him my coat, mother, so he'll not forget
His master then will be dead
Speak to him kindly and often of Joe
Pat him on his brown shaggy head

And you, mother dear, may you miss me for a while?
But in heaven no larger I grow
And any kind angel will open the gate
When you ask for your darling Little Joe

And any kind angel will open the gate
When you ask for your darling Little Joe

"Those pretty wild flowers I love them so well
The flowers know secrets that I'll never tell
I go out to pick a bouquet of all
And bring them all in before the leaves start to fall

When the leaves start to fall and the flowers have died
If only little darling I could be by your side
Tho' it breaks my heart to hear your name
Soon the wild flowers will bloom again in the spring

I wish I could see her and talk of our love
And of all the pretty flowers sent here from above
Oh maybe I'll see her in Heaven someday
And pick pretty flowers as we go on our way

The memories of you dear I'll never erase
There'll never be another that can take your place
I'll still keep our secret with the flowers of love
And we'll pick them together in Heaven above

"My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire

People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall

Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even a pawn must hold a grudge

Statues made of match sticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring

The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows rainy
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing

"The lights turned on and the curtain fell down
And when it was over, it felt like a dream
They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream
The agents had paid for the black limousine
That waited outside in the rain
Did you see them, did you see them?
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

Eighteen years of American dream
He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall
He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall
His mother had told him a trip was a fall
And don't mention babies at all
Did you see him, did you see him?
Did you see him in the river?
He was there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

The streets were lined for the wedding parade
The queen wore the white gloves, the county of song
The black-covered caisson her horses had drawn
Protected her king from the sun rays of dawn
They married for peace and were gone
Did you see them, did you see them?
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

And a shadow is cast on devotion
She is the one that I adore
Queen of my silent suffocation

I'm possessed by her
I'm bearing a cross
She's turned into my curse

I've spent a lifetime looking for love
Just when I find it, it comes undone
I've tried so hard to make love happen
Like some never ending pattern
I end up on the sad side of the fun


Hurting comes easy
Hurting comes easy
Hurting comes easy

Well, I've seen people that got it made
They've got someone and love looks great
But me, I've been to every doctor
I've tried it wild and tried it proper
And I always end up watching love walk away

And hopefully as I grow older
Love won't be so difficult to see
But now for me

No it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave


Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything


No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave


Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man


No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave


So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect

It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold
You know they're here when the water is red
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread
A message etched on broken ships

She's bleeding out
Their innocence is heaven sent
Their malevolence, it will not relent
A graveyard sits upon the shore
They won't swim together anymore


The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the Devil is near
The tide will rush in waves of fear
Selling souls, the Devil is near

Of all those species to survive 'cause we need them more than they need us

We'll be here till corruption quits
There is a voice, though they cannot speak
Not yet ready to admit defeat

In the swampy August dawn
What a mischief you would bring, young darling
When the onus is not all your own
When you’re up for it before you've grown
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


From the faun forever gone
In the towers of your honeycomb
I’d a tore your hair out just to climb back, darling
When you’re filling out your only form
Can you tell that itʼs just ceremon’?
Now you've added up to what you’re from
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


Build your tether rain-out from your fragments
Break the sailor’s table on your sacrum
Fuck the fiercest fables, I’m with Hagen


For the love, comes the burning young
From the liver, sweating through your tongue
Well, youʼre standing on my sternum
Don’t you climb down, darling

Smoke on Sundays when youʼre drunk and dressed
Out the hollows where the swallow nests

All my friends say that they're happy that I'm moving on
First time that they've seen me smile since you up and gone
But your memory won't let me go
Pretty as a picture that you'd hang up on a wall
But she just can't compare to you and it really ain't her fault
I know that I should fall for her
Believe me, girl, I've tried
But your memory won't let me


She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
No, your memory won't let me


Sometimes when she's close to me I still smell your perfume
And every time I'm holding her, I'm really holding you
And any man in his right mind would be all hers by now
But your memory won't let me


She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
Oh your memory won't let me


I know that I should fall for her
Believe me, girl, I've tried

"Story time
Sways away the haze
They spent contemplating, formulating, theory siring above me swimming
Pay tribute to the few we look up to
Come again
You my soul fool
Who will know us but our brothers
Those who down with us are thinking
New school, tip top, pound the feeble
Walking and talking
Low down and evil
Follow me now
Yo Vato
The nix hex is on

Would everybody just look at the hook
I took it strait from my brain
Reminds me of the time I was insane
And so I wrote it when I was loaded
And voted the least likely to turn out like a square

I'm singing it for your mind and no
I'm singing it for your ears
Jump up and down and leave the ground and know that's why your here
And they say down diggey down down, down diggey diggey down, stronger, longer
Line up your ways of know what I'm thinking say it again

And now I'm with my home team back with a good seat
I gladwick like chadwick to tell you what I mean
Were laying back on it just like good s**
Smooth yet physcodelic it's called the nix hex-um

The monologue of a singalong
Las banderas de san juan piden pa?????
""I'm feelin' fine, lord it's time""????? Go tell it on a mountain, then again bring a friend
You'll maybe get dizzy with a scence of vertigo

Uplifted soul from the view that I'm on nothin' but love
But love
But love in my blood sonic in the vortex
This is the hip thing
Called the nix hex
Dig it

Begin
Come see me now come see me now baby
Come see me now come see me now aye
Come see me now come see me now Baby
Come see me now come see me now

I'm wickedy wild I need to put down
I come without a wreck so let's get
I'm wickedy wild I need to put down
I come without a wreck so let's get down

I want to make some music in this country
And I am the rhythm missionary with the melody
Wait a minute, just a minute
Yes yes time to rhyme and shine now rip it rip

Jump up and down cause that's the 311 style
Cruise on by the frowners, float follow me now with a smile
I got a golden ticket not gonna even pick it
I heard it he said it I heard it but it we but it went something like

The rhythm will make you want to move your body

What is it about my smile that makes you lie to my face?
If I close my eyes to your bullshit, I could still smell it on you
I could smell it from a mile away
You can't be the truth and be loved
Oh no, hey
Make up your mind, baby
What is it about my smile that makes you lie to my face?


Let me ask this, just what does it take to be the apple of your iris?
How much of this bullshit until we reach the pasture?
Ain't no need to gas me, it was lit from the lashes
Back when chit-chattin' casually 'bout how you think monogamy is somethin' of the past
But, baby girl, your actions speak somethin' totally opposite
And you have to pardon me, 'cause I am a dog, you see
And if you lead me to the park, I break up off the leash
What is it about my smile that would make you ponder kickin' dirt in my water?
Spillin' bleach in the laundry bag and stressin' my momma
Pushin' dents in my armor, scratchin', dentin' my Pontiac
Bitch, are you off your shit?
I bag another one just to piss you off and shit
Don't make me put the shit I bought you up for auction, bitch


Hold on, hold the fuck up
Pause this shit


My lady drives me high up the wall
She keeps me up and locked in the bathin' room
Why am I screamin' at the top of my lungs?
When she can't hear a word that I say to her?


You petty, petty bitch, 
Calculate 
Trackin' 
All of this 
Worthless shit, you packaged up
Don't stop my shit, 
Bitch, now you know that was totally out of pocket


Would've let me fall off

I won't sweat the small stuff

I can't keep from fallin' off
Keep me from these useless bitches, these ruthless leeches
I might catch you all alone



Now bro, he lends me no help at all
He's out there chasin' money that's far too small
Lately, he's talkin' 'bout investin' withdraw
But the loan of which you owe me is far from paid off
Oh, Lord

Is that if you a bad boy
Yo, what's up man

Oh shit! 

Fatal, Outlawz runnin' up out this motherfucker
I'm going past niggas
Ain't gettin' me out the game like this, fuck that!
It's Outlaw, nigga


If you a bad boy then you die
Westside Outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when they robbed me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside Outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when they robbed me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep


I focus my locus thought on the enemy
Sick of the Hennessy, it's necessary to finish me
I'm antisocial, immortal when it come to the vocal
Jersey them niggas down, and won't approach 'em 'til it's time to smoke 'em
Hussein the terrorist
Nigga they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they try to find me a therapist
Rapid fire, I clap an eye 'til you die a liar
Strapped and next hittin' corners dropped 'em didn't want to spin the tires
My man will find ya
This 357 anaconda is enough to brand ya mama then turn around and hand you drama
Military comradery, Oulaw 'til they body me
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin' at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep, you try to bust me 'til death?
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who, what, when and why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted


Now ever since momma got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us, murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
Similar to savages, it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin' damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash when flaunted
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me? Fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
Like the sound of police
Who run the streets really?
In every hood legends grow
From the hustlas up in Harlem to shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress, we stressed
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'




Halfway thugs don't budge when we stalk the streets
Sort of like chalk and narcotics when they walk the beat
You speak the beef pussy, draw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Gettin' mines with nine cocked extortin'
Blocks pop with 22's in my socks with the butt hangin' out the chocolate
You never seen time I travel across dream crime
My rolls like a million dollar bill, folded with green lines
With my foes erased drink my Henney straight no chasin'
Catch my body like cases; 5 minutes from the station


Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
No finger prints that mean there was no evidence or proof that I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
After they made this punk, fag motherfucka bleed
Money was bloody as shit, y'all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bowin' off to one knee shit
The Glock to your head nigga, don't make no sudden action
Hit innocent bystanders when he blastin', dumped fuckin' backwards
Little homies puttin' work for stripes
But is it worth your life and G-rides runnin' red lights
I wish somebody would have told me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napoleon ain't no cell they can hold me in
Or cage me in, crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like them niggas gon' fade me in
Havin' a fiend page me 
When they want the product, nigga I got the smoke
Got this weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you workin' with?, I'm on some ol' immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin' shit, use artillery to murder with
Put on the block, gangsta party and like 'Pac
Life's hard from the ox, me and my niggas on top 


I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, they comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, they comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E


Runnin' my Glock, put the lead in pop, fuck the law
Carry steel 'cause I live on the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes 'cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin'
Quick to blow and dispose if you plot on hittin'
Ridin' high, blazin', kryptonite got a nigga dazin'
Burpin' and smirkin' at enemies before I grave 'em
Ride up, looked behind him, I see him, he slippin'
At a stop light on this lonely night

Slide on him, so I can dip and put it in him

Hit the pedal now we high speedin'
With the metal tryna make these motherfuckers die speedin'
Up the way I seen him slow down

Caught 'em runnin' on E, that's kinda funny to me
They knew they was funkin' with me but they dumb to see


Open up fire watch 'em expire when my shells split 'em
Plus all them trick-niggas bitchin can go to hell with 'em
Fuck 'em they phony claimin' they homies but they foes
Speakin' on thug niggas daily, while we nailin' they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words are known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
A crooked thought, cops get bought, no longer caught
Out on bail, raisin' hell, nigga fuck what you thought
Did you cry when my girl died?
Put out the hit, politic niggas worldwide, grabbin' my dick
I’ll never learn, take away the pain with sherm
Throwin' gas on my enemies watchin' 'em burn
Kamikaze, I’m shootin' up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a piñata and party
His last breath, a straight lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E..


Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E
One time, one time for the niggas that stayed down for us
Runnin' on E
Smif-n-Wessun the Cocoa Brovaz, Buckshot, BDI, runnin' on E

"Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish
‘til its stock is in the ground
So men of fame
Can never find a way
‘til time has flown
Far from their dying day

Forgotten while you’re here
Remembered for a while
A much updated ruin
From a much outdated style

Life is but a memory
Happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness
For a long forgotten show
Seems so easy
Just to let it go on by
‘til  you stop and wonder
Why you never wondered why

Safe in the womb
Of an everlasting night
You find the darkness can
Give the brightest light
Safe in your place deep in the earth
That’s when they’ll know what you were truly worth

Forgotten while you’re here
Remembered for a while

From a much outdated style

Can never find a way

No-one knows you but the rain and the air
Don’t you worry
They’ll stand and stare when you’re gone

Open your eyes to another year
They’ll all know

You would never leave me


Shorty do the most
Remember we was close?
Flew them private planes
Came back on them boats
One that gave you money
Said you wanted love
When I gave you love
Said you wanted money
All that fighting and that calling back, played out
Got me riding in that spaceship, spaced out
We was the dream team nothing could stop
Now you got me sitting on my hands shaking, Waka Flocka
Sometimes you gotta laugh to cry out
Knowing if I leave you, shorty always down to ride out
Me and Meek, Ashanti pouring up
You gonna leave me and go back to what? Montana


I’m kind of mad that I love you
Because even when I try to move on
I still be thinking of you
I’m trying to get away from you
Because all this stress in my life is all because of you

And that was just the make up and then we wake up then we break up
Then I never say much tears dripping all on your make up

They got a nigga shedding tears, reminiscin on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death
My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit's scary, our black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm gettin worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same
Cause all the little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block




Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male living in hell when will we prevail
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
In a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robbings, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Misled from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block




And I can't help but wonder why
So many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's in a drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin focus... on my block




And block parties in the projects lastin way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, misses call
I know the young niggas understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes
Tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game... from my block


Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers who passed away
From all the blocks that I’m from
One-twelve street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin?
183rd and Walt, my block, that’s right
122nd and Morningside, my block, that’s right
Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block, that’s right
In the jungle of Marin City, that’s my block, that’s right
Los Angeles, haha, that’s my block too

Fuck with 'em from a distance, I'm a tycoon

Now I'm a mothafuckin' millionaire 
Money longer than Diana Ross hair

Keep your things in a place meant to hide
But I know they're there somewhere
And I know that's where you'll go tonight
I'll be thrown over just like before


The white lady loves you more


Need a metal man just to pick up your feet
It's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discreet
I know what this metal is for


The white lady loves you more


I'm looking at a hand full of broken plans
And I'm tired of playing it down
You just want her to do anything to you
There ain't nothing that you won't allow

You say, ""She's waiting and I know what for.""

Don't speak too soon
I told the boss off and made my move
Got nowhere to go

Son of the shining path, the clouded mind
The couple killer, each and every time


I'm not uncomfortable, feeling weird
Lonely leered, options disappeared
But I know what to do
Son of Sam, son of a doctor's touch, a nurse's love
Acting under orders from above


King for a day

Son of the shining path, the clouded mind
The couple killer, running out of time

While you were curled and sleeping
And I wandered far beneath a concrete star

But you're not the same, you died along the way
Now we're ghosts and we're praying for winter

You gotta understand that when it was in to have a gun and be in the street, my mother gave that up to be in the house and wash the dishes and feed us and put the thoughts in our brains.

Callin' all dogs and phony rap stars

I'm on some Superman shit now
They shouldn't have shot me

Cause I'm convinced that my squad is real
And God has blessed me with the power to be hard 2 kill
I got a mind that's full of murderous thoughts
When unleashed
I make them niggas bow
Feel me now or be deceased
I ain't choosing sides
Hell no

Problems are getting worked out faster than calisthenics

Blazed up on top of my man's roof
Hands on a fully AK so what'chu plan to do

Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhyth with ral rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance
The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here let me introduce you
Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a HABIT
Ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose
Too many milligram
NO ONE made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'im
He'll never forget 'im
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em
At least when he left he'll know what hit 'im
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

And I feel snuffed out


It's been 33 years of restraining
Of trying to control this tumult
How I did invest in such fantasy
But my nervous system has worn out


I feel done, I feel raked over coals
And all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up


I've repeated this dance ad-nauseum
There's still something to learn that I've not
I'm told to see this as divine perfection
But my bones don't feel this perfection


I feel done, I feel raked over coals
And all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up


I've spent life hovering above bottom
Thinking I can't survive what's below
But I've known through the kicking and screaming
That there was no other direction to go


I feel done, I feel raked over coals
And all that remains is the case
That it's a bitch to grow up

Waiting to finally be caught

O' come, come let us adore Him
Adore Him


Can't wait to make new memories
No stress hanging over me
We got love, let it cover me
All I need is what's in front of me
Yeah, it's a moment I've been waiting for all year
What joy it brings me
To kneel before the King


Got the joy that you feel inside
I've been waiting all year just to get it right
Yeah, think the angel's gon' sing with me
And my baby put something under the tree for me
Yeah, all of that frustration I let it go 
We can turn missiles to mistletoe 
We can make family out of foes
It's funny He'll take the sun and turn the rain into snow like


O' come, let us adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
Kneel right down before Him
Adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
O' come, let us adore Him
Kneel right down before Him
Adore Him
O' come, come let us adore Him
Adore Him
O' come, come let us adore Him
Adore Him


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Head bowed with my hands high
Froze, waiting for His time, tell Him standby 
He changed the world, that's a landslide 
God meant for all mankind 
I've been waiting for this all year 
Got my family and they all here 
And they all here 
Come and see while we all here

How do you see if the dream is gone?
Fading fires, moving on
Why do you need it, when the waves come?
Over you, to undertow


Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Like the first fires
Running for defences you don't have to protect
In the first fires


And if you can find it, don't let go
Hold it tight, keep it close
Don't even fight it, when the leaves fall
Over me, this heavy load


Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Like the first fires
Running for defences you don't have to protect
In the first fires


And all your memories are caught in the wind
Of the first fires
Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Like the first fires
Like the first fires


Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again

Dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope they don't make fun of you
When you grow up and go to school, okay?
'Cause Winter is a badass name
Dear Winter, I hope you talk to girls
Or boys or anyone you like
I just hope you don't stay in every night
'Cause I wish I was out tonight


Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I'm hoping that some day, I can meet you on this Earth
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first


Dear Winter, I hope you like this song
And even when you're 13
And you scream at me for parenting you wrong
I hope it's still a badass song


Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
It really doesn't seem like there's anyone for me
But dear Winter, I hope you like your name
You know I cannot wait to teach you how to curse
But shit, I gotta meet your mom first


Dear Winter, don't move too far away
And please don't say I'm hovering
When I text you to ask about your day
I wanna hear about your day


Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Will we still hang out and talk when I'm no longer in charge?
Oh, dear Winter, I hope you like your name
I hope you let me take a shot with you on your 21st
But shit, you gotta ask your mom first


Dear Winter, I'm looking for your mom
I gotta find a girl that doesn't mind that I'm inside my head a lot
Winter, it won't be too long
First, I just gotta find your mom

In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand


Why explain the game?
Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions as victims can't stand the heat, then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean, itchin'
Givin' suckers plenty space, have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now, guns found daily
The Feds trail me in hoax that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope, they backwards make the track burst
Whenever I rap, attack
Words been known to explode on contact
Extreme at times, blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me, truely effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice, got a death wish, bitch
Run, but face being traced, by the infrared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back
Explode the track to confetti
Unload it, 'cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw


In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand


Code 3: attack formation, pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils 'cause they itchin' to get you
Merciless madman, screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire, makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'?
Indeed a possibility that's part of chasin' cream
Dope got me hatin' fiends
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives, come closer exhale the fumes
We got memories, fadin' fast
A slave for cash accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now! How you like it, raw?
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the Outlawz
Never surrender, death before dishonor, stay free
I'm thugged out, fuck the world 'cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin' believe in me
And you could see the victory, a warrior in jewels, will you picture me?
Life of an outlaw


In the life we live as thugs 
Everybody fuckin' with us , so can't you see 
It's hard to be a man 
Ridin' with my guns in hand



City under siege, it's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car thieves G.E.D. from the streets
Plenty beef I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb peep! They sneak up from behind tryin' to creep
No halfs with no straps, jack, it's on to bounce back
An ounce of wrath so bad, it snatched my style on death
Tell the gripper I was sent to get ya, snip with clippers
Get the picture, I wrote my life down as a scripture


And still I'm lost in the land of the lonely where ain't nobody holy
A matter of a fact, we unholy Everybody livin' soley
For themselves, too high strung to lend help
To somebody who be needin' it
You know we lost hope and he needin' it
But the evil it's forever
But I'm rappin' low down, scandalous like a tramp is
All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit 6 months in advanced to what we plotted
Approached the goal on swole and now I got it


Uh, I crack my window, knowin' they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'
Attach a strap under my pillow, hand to hand like we freakin'
Creepin' deep into the mornin'
Peepin' out the weak while they yawnin'
And let my clout speak for itself
No doubt, outlaw, outta my mind outta time you're all blind
Some kind of life of mine if K-Dog don't mind
Findin' it funny, matter of fact, 'cause it is perhaps
Finally I'll adapt to it, over the years as an outlaw


Eh, Napoleon
What's up, nigga?
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah
Would you kill for me, nigga?
On my grandmother, nigga
Ayy, yo
What's up
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out


Well, now they all say that vultures and parasites
Snakes are all alike, thug life break night
Drink 'til we fist fight, life or death
But you can't win with a vest
Won't be no breathin' for the reason, punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark, and I admit it's dark
So chase on the ave., hide your stash, beware from them marks
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left up in your belly
And let me bust back to them niggas 'til they all cold and sweaty

I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised


Your mother says that I'm a stranger
A face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise darling
I'll see you on God's golden shore


Through this open world I'm a-bound to ramble
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain
I'm a-bound to ride that morning railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train


I'm a-going back to Colorado
The place that I've started from
If I'd know-ed how bad you'd treat me
Honey, I never would have come

"Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah the country was young
With God on its side

The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I’s made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side

The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fightin'
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side

The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side

I’ve learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side

But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When God’s on your side

Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for ya'
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side

So now as I’m leavin'
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And they fall to the floor
If God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war

Lights out!


If tomorrow's not here, I write down all of my worst fears
Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers
Apparently I will watch the whole world collapse and appear
No tears, my intuition tells me that the end is near
The only thing I should fear is fear itself
Learn that being afraid of God is being afraid of yourself
So go to church nigga, but I won't go cause I don't know
Where all the money and the collection plate go
If the church still owe, then you know, read your bible at home
I'ma read it myself, all the stories that I'm reading show me how to prevail
The guard came in the other day and gave me some mail and said that I got a phone call
When I get out we gon' go harder than Medusa, building stone walls out of human flesh
Dave Koresh, burn that shit down even though I'm not around
I know you gon' hold it down till the day that I get out


If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
So are you it, or you ain't, or just claiming to be?
Either you're something, or nothing, or just nothing to see
If tomorrow's not here
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching


If tomorrow's not here, I write down all of my worst fears
Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers
We, been afraid of something that is out of my control
Like a verse from Duckworth, make a silly rapper's butt hurt
Sodomized through the eyes of a troubled youth
Talking between the bars, you tell them within the booth
Way back in 2012 when a nigga was 22
Passed you the Tropicana now my niggas got the juice
For millennias to come, go Millennium Falcon
Fuck a hand out, I'd rather leave my hands solo
The smartest thing you ever did, Curry, was going solo
While I'm in the county blues, lofty bout to take over the promo for the fam
I'm here because I never gave a damn, like an angry beaver
Smoking dust and reefer
Live life, smoke a pound, even though I'm not around
I know you gon' hold it down till the day that I get out


If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
So are you it, or you ain't, or just claiming to be?
Either you're something, or nothing, or just nothing to see

We are riding for the battlefield in force tonight
Fury of the darkest evil cry for war
Far beyond the boundaries of hell and starlight
On the road to lands unknown forevermore


Through the caverns far below our quest will lead us
Onwards through the ice and snow forevermore
Standing fighting full of hate, the time has come now
Stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war


On wings of glory we will carry on
Far across forgotten lands towards the distant sun
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come


Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Through the force in our power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, fury of the storm


Here we are the chosen ones, we cannot fail now
Spilling all the blood on the fires below
Smashing through the boundaries with the fire and fury
Killing all the mortals down the winding road


Hell fires are raging the storm growing strong
On the path to victory towards the distant sun
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come


Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Through the force in our power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, fury of the storm


Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
To the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Through the force in our power, it will soon reach the hour

But when I call, you never seem to be home
To tell you


Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart

Next time, slow it down and don't feel you have to rush

Andai a piedi alla guardia medica!

Arrivo lì, ma il dottore non c'è!
E' in sciopero anche lui! Che gioco è! Ma?!
Ma come finirà...
C'è il caos nella città
Non so più cosa far!
Se non sciopero, mi picchiano

And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted

I said, ""How come the men here suffer like they do?""
""Men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
Even though they know they're only passin' through""

Passin' through, passin' through ...

I was by Franklin Roosevelt's side on the night before he died
He said, ""One world must come out of world war two"" 
""Yankee, Russian, white or tan,"" he said, ""a man is still a man
We're all on one road, and we're only passin' through.""

Passin' through, passin' through ...

"Now that I know what it’s like to fall freely
I can taste blood for the ones who I envy
Trying to make it right, they won’t catch me
Now that it’s gone, just watch what I will do

Watch me break
Watch me gently breaking both our hearts
Watch me gently breaking
Watch me gently breaking our hearts

Now that I’ve sealed the deal
I don’t know how to feel
Now that I know that it’s for real
Just how am I supposed to feel

What do you do when your mind won’t reconcile
With the thing your heart wants it to part by a mile
Trying to make them ride like a summit
Neither one will give in so on down you plummet

Watch me fake
Watch me faking that I know just what to do
Watch me plainly faking
Meanwhile I drive a stake in our hearts

Now that I’ve sealed the deal
I don’t know how to feel
Now that I know that it’s for real
Just how am I supposed to feel

Now that I’ve sealed the deal

For wealth and what it will buy
But don't they know on judgment day
That gold and silver will melt away

I'd rather be in a dark grave
And to know that my poor soul was saved

And deny my God and doom my soul

Nothing could be half so compelling
As you and me, our senses telling us where to go
You give me quite a show

Upon the ground and always taking it slow
Here we go

I taste the salt on your skin and then it’s really beginning

Go again and again ’til we’re spent

I've been running 'round for a long time
Feels like I've only begun
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
Way easier said than done
If God is for me.. tell me what could be against
When I look around all I see is this  like..
Everyone's worried 'bout falling in love, I was in it till death
I'm in a hurry now, thinking 'bout lyrics and where does the beat slaps
So I've been running, what else is there to do?
I treat love like a crowd, I'm always pushing through


I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
But I've been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
But I've been feeling like I found a gold mine
Only right that I gotta go grind
It's only right that I gotta go grind
I've been doing this for a long time


So excellence..
Difference between me and him is the effortless
Effort I've been putting in so I do, I go measure it
Exit this.. that I've plotting to exit this 
That I've been sitting in, so far from stopping
I should be mixing, instead I'm writing
Ignoring  on my explorer page
Yes, I've been sorta late..
Is it distorted faith?
 that my God has been fixing me something better than I could have imagined
If it was my time, I would have been average

So all of my problem, they feel like a joke


I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
But I've been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
But I've been feeling like I found a gold mine
Only right that I gotta go grind
It's only right that I gotta go grind
I've been doing this for a long time


So.. late nights, early mornings, cold showers
Struggle and the hustle gets my soul power
Close to my loved ones, never feeling alone
Tryna get some work done, gotta get in my zone
 started to go dry
Don't think I'm special, I'm just another guy
Tryna follow God, I don't always do it right and
Step into the light, cause the dark was the frightening

I can't stress all the things that I can not control
But when I get ahold of something as whole other things that don't matter I have to let go..
 today
 I can not escape
And it's okay really, I'ma do my part
Hoping that you feel me


I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
I've been running 'round for a long time

No, I’ll give them some new shit

Looky here motherfucker: I’m not playing

I put paper before hoes: thats why I’m so rich 
I paved the way, long dick, now we all fit 
Doc check my temperature: Why I’m so cold?
The hood left the left side of my chest froze
I’m more about pimpin', gettin' bank rolls
Sittin' watchin' them trickin' on them stank hoes 
We can share love like, Kanye and Khalifa
From runways in Milan, to big bags of reefer 
She alright for a night, but don’t keep her

"The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed

Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time, it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays

The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate

Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?

So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires...

Some shit I ain't sure of ay lawd ay ay


These days bout money and power
Some places see a death an hour
Some say that we neglecting ours
All respect you need to check your output
Might reflect whenever next to flowers
When the world had color when the world was ours
Now we all slaves bring  showers
Send men to battles cause they all cowards
And we don't say shit cause we all cattle
We want paper so we gon' gamble
Shit will never change in the struggle
Just another day man I hate it and I love it
Parents tryna shape me but a nigga ain't budging'
Imma get it how I want it like they ain't say nothin'
Gotta stay blunted fadeaway like Jordan
Feel no pain quite numbin' till the next day comin'
Spend my next day huntin'
For the vision that I seen up in my dreams
Ain't standin' up nigga why do you complain ?
Me against the world cause society's tame
If you lie to me once I will never trust again
Can't be a pawn Imma right my own wrongs
Closed eyes look inside see the pain all gone
All love gained and the feeling so warm
Closed eyes look inside see the pain all gone


Lawd
Yeah
Shit
These days I got so much shit on my brain
These days I got so much shit on my brain
These days I got so much shit on my brain
These days I got so much shit on my brain
These days I got so much shit on my brain
These days I got so much shit on my brain
These days I got so much shit on my brain
These days I got so much shit on my brain

Ay I wonder whats my purpose ay

Sweet teardrops

"I met a woman long ago
Her hair the black that black can go
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered no

I met a girl across the sea
Her hair the gold that gold can be
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find
Follow me the wise man said
But he walked behind

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all

Morning came and then came noon
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon

Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break

One morning I woke up alone
The hospital and the nurses gone
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone

I ate and ate and ate
No, I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate

I spent my hatred everyplace
On every work on every face
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace

Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again

I was handsome, I was strong
I knew the words of every song
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong

Who is it whom I address?
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest

Oh teachers, are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?

Barely holding together
Mapless zone the road signs hold
Keep ahead of the weather

Long past time to close dead eyes
Find a break in the highway
Out here I'm invisible
Very few going my way


Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home


Ghost town strip of misery
I ain't feeling no better
Road kill heart inside of me
Follow it to the letter

Sundown brings a welcome change
Everything that's hiding
More at home in landscapes strange
Are you selling I'm buying


Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home
Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul
Connect the dot scribbling
And you would never know


Failed to heed the signal
Thought you got through just in time
Crashing hard upon your ego
Penetrated from the side


I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday

Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right

Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

Through the dark night and through the rain

Striving forever more...

Overpowered by the glory and might
Of the ones who stand tall

But my mind goes on remembering the days of me and you
When we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you

You said you needed simple things that I had plenty of
And through the days of dark and lean, we could always live on love
With his style of life he lured you, and you could not refuse
But when we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you

When you honeymooned in Paris, it was carried on the news
And I heard you laughed your cares away on a Caribbean cruise

You were always one for dreaming, now you're dreams can all come true
But when we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you

You said you needed simple things that I had plenty of
And through the days of dark and lean, we could always live on love
With his style of life, he lured you, and you could not refuse
But when we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you

Yes, when we were down to nothing, nothing sure looked good on you

That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
I ain't mad at ya at all 
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin' Outlaw
That's right nigga, hahaha.. housin' these hoes, you feel me?
Aight, you know what I'm sayin'?
You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?
Keepin' it real!
How old are you nigga?
I'm eleven


Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryna survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we been through
Witnessin' evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'
Pull 'n' fuckin' fire when I leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em
Hostile hoes catch elbows  negroes disposed of
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a


Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 


Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?
High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive
By makin' motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop
Got no time for the court, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin', an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a


Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 



Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggas lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest


So I just ... swallow my Beck's and holla, ""Fuck 'em!""
And if I'm next ... just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin' nuttin'


Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me
 Definitely no need for askin'
 Top speed  laughin' 


Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' 'bout prayin'


They need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggas sprayin' up my block


Tryin' to take my wealth


Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw 


Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggas run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin' but muuuusic
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin REAL strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
But all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's
Stop bein' a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real ill
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin' bastards
I never die, thug niggas multiply
Cause after me is Thug Life baby
Then the young thugs
Then the youngest thug of all, my nigga RahRah!

Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away


So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!


The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight


So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my… throne


I'll leave you chokin' on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know 
I'll leave you chokin' on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

If you could step into my head
Tell me, would you still know me?
If you woke up in my bed
Tell me, would you hold me
Or would you simply let it lie
Leaving me to wonder why?
I can’t get you out of this head
I call mine and I will say


Oh no, I can’t let you go
My little girl
Because you’re holding up my world
So I need you
Your imitation of my walk
And the perfect way you talk
It’s just a couple of the million things
That I love about you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you


And if I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge
Tell me, would you still follow me?
And if I made you mad today
Tell me, would you love me tomorrow? Please?
Or would you say that you don’t care
And then leave me standing here
Like the fool who is drowning in despair
And screaming?


Oh no, I can’t let you go

The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
He didn’t care


He stood in a field where barley grows


His head did no thinking
His arms didn’t move except when the wind cut up rough
And mice ran around on the ground


He stood in a field where barley grows


The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he’s resigned to his fate
‘Cause life’s not unkind – he doesn’t mind


He stood in a field where barley grows

You can talk about the latest
The latest of your home
These boll weevils, they will rob you of a home
They're lookin' for a home

The first time I seen the boll weevil
He was sittin' on a square
Next time I seen the boll weevil
He had his whole family there
He's-a lookin' for a home
He's-a lookin' for a home


The farmer take the boll weevil
Put him in the sand
The boll weevil says to the farmer, ""You are treating me just like a man
I'll have a home, I'll-a have a home
And I'll have a home, and I'll have a home
And I'll have a home, and I'll have a home""


Now the farmer, he says to the merchant
""I never made but one bale
Before I'll let you have that last one, I'll suffer and die in jail
And I'll have a home, and I'll have a home""


And the old lady says to her old man
""I been trying my level best
To keep these boll weevils out of my brand new cotton dress
It's full of holes, and it's full of holes
Yes it's full of holes, yes it's full of holes
Yes it's full of holes, yes it's full of holes""

Put him in the ice

And I'll have a home, and I'll have a home""

Tell 'em its Huddie Ledbetter, he's done been here and gone

But the label called today they said they have to cut you loose
I felt broken like a vase that'd fallen from the roof
Tears rolling down my face lord what am I to do

A fractured wrist and a broken heart
But this is sure to leave a nasty scar, one that might not heal

This is a declaration, of a war fought behind a veil
This is a revelation, as told through the age old tale
In which I've heard a thousand times before, nothing matters anymore
And I'm reminded as I stare at this revolving door
Of all the times I've failed, and all the times I've sworn
I'd never give up hope, and change what I stand for

I might not escape this time
Caught in this nightmare, dreams turn to thin air

My life is on the line, it seems as if I'm running out of time
And my thoughts are consuming me
Is this the person I'm suppose to be?

It's like the fear of being buried alive
The more I try, the more I die inside
I struggle to keep my dreams while awake
But the fear grows inside and puts me to sleep

The walls doubt built up, will fall to the ground

Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border

And I was William Sheeran

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture

None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm

Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up




These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me

You're working so damn hard you forgot what you like
And come hang out don't you leave us behind

I can't complain, no I won't be mourning
'Cause I skipped on prom for Elvis Duran in the Morning
All of my life I have been starving
Not for a dinner with friends, more of a starving artist


Yep yep I'm gonna miss this someday

Maybe that's why I haven't seen friends in a while

While I'm doing promo, trying to blow up in Chicago

Got more wood than a fucking cabin

Bout to get the paper like school supply shopping

Neighborhood jeans on top of the moccasins
Money in my pocket necessary like oxygen

Laying on a sports page
Bagged up the number of your age in 10th grade
Another day another dollar
Pushing the pedal on the Chevy with the Pradas
You sitting low on 24s
My Chevy higher than stdio 54

Keep a level head got money so i count it

Wood-grain dash
Candy cane flip flop
Hook on my ass
Bitches on my nuts
Niggas stay hatin'

My telescope looks out into the stars tonight
A little speck of light seems twice the size tonight
The calculations are so fine
Can it be growing all the time?


Now I can't believe it's true
And I don't know what to do
For the hundredth time I check the declination
Now the fear starts to grow
Even my computer shows
There are no errors in the calculations


Now it's happened, take no other view
Collision course, you must believe it's true
Now there's nothing left that we can do


When two worlds collide
The anger and the pain
Of all those who remain
Two worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide


When two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When two worlds collide

Writing your story on the edge of dreams
Like someone had before you





Some say love is blind
Still it's hard to find
The one that unfolds my truth 
So I'm sitting by the phone
Helpless and alone
I'm waiting for someone to call


I wish you were mine
Wish we could find
A time and place to be alone
Because without you I'm incomplete
So help me
Gotta think twice, to realize
I'm telling you my story now
It is written for me but untold to you





If you care to look
In my storybook
All pages have got your name 
But you look upon my face
And tell me I've got grace
But that's not enough for me

She sit on her porch every day at about past noon
But from her eyes, I just see a sad and blue
Is there anything that I can do for you?
She'd say, ""No my son, the Lord will see me through""
 his name was Little Ray
Red in his eyes and all he know is getting paid
Sell his soul to the devil if he could
Ms. Martha, she do her best, like we know she always would


Sometimes I'm up, and times I'm down
It's like one way in, and no way out
But we oughta know each other
And spread love around the world, not hate amongst each other
Like Ms. Martha
Like Ms. Martha
Like Ms. Martha
Like Ms. Martha


Standing at her place, just to see the waste
Never much to say, kept an empty face
Could it be, she just doesn't have a man
Or maybe, we just don't understand
There are so many things I wish to do for you
Follow your heart to make the dreams come true
 the reason why I haven't passed away
I lived to make sure you'd see a better day


Sometimes I'm up, and times I'm down
It's like one way in, and no way out
But we oughta know each other
And spread love around the world, not hate amongst each other

"Oh how sadly sound the songs the queen must sing of dying
A prisoner upon her throne of melancholy sighing
If she could see her mirror now
She would be free of those who bow and
Scrape the ground before her feet

Silently she walks among her dying midnight roses
Watches as each moment goes that never really know us
And so it seems she doesn't care
If she has dreams of no one there
Within the shadows of her room

But all my frozen words agree, and say it's time to
Call back, all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen
Inside these empty halls

Wooden lady turn and turn among my weary secrets
And wave within the hours past and other empty pockets
Maybe we've found what we have lost
When we've unwound so many crossed entangling
Misunderstandings; but

All my frozen words agree and say it's time to
Call back all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen
Inside these empty walls

Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie
Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride
Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe
Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity, they parted our families
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross 
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering
400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to 26's after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the 400 years we never saw
The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss
Slaves


I said the 400 years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got 4,5,6 rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an 02' Monte Carlo with 24's on it
And on the back of the window it says, ""Get on my level ho""
You're a vanity slave

We're all vanity slaves, and with that being said
Can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here, hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month, checks coming in
I'm tryna get some
What up?

Sweet almond eyes just to see and be seen

Makes love like a rabbit to my velveteen

Midnight to six man
For the first time from Jamaica
Dillinger and Leroy Smart
Delroy Wilson, your cool operator
Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae
With backing bands sound systems
If they've got anything to say
There's many black ears here to listen
But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right
Charging from the bass knives to the treble
But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel
Onstage they ain't got no... roots rock rebel
Dress back jump back this is a bluebeat attack
Jones'in won't get you anywhere
Fooling with your guns
The British Army is waiting out there
An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons
White youth, black youth
Better find another solution
Why not phone up Robin Hood
And ask him for some wealth distribution
Punk rockers in LA
They won't notice anyway
They're all too busy fighting
For a good place under the lighting
The new groups are not concerned
With what there is to be learned
They got Burton suits, ha you think it's funny
Turning rebellion into money
All over people changing their votes
Along with their overcoats
If Adolf Hitler flew in today
They'd send a limousine anyway
And the all night drug-prowling wolf
Who looks so sick in the sun
And the white man in the Palais
But you go lookin' for fun

Oh please mister, leave me alone

Last night, my tears they were falling
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you
And then you met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talking to


I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
Because I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on her shoulder
You smiled at her, she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me


Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I knew that you would marry me

You are appreciated
Always was a Black queen
Always was a Black Queen, mama


When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain’t a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we’d blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin’ to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There’s no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Lady, don't you know we love ya? 
Sweet lady, place no one above ya 
Sweet lady, don’t you know we love ya?



Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn’t let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Lady, don't you know we love ya? 
Sweet lady, place no one above ya 
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?



Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Lady, don't you know we love ya? 
Sweet lady, place no one above ya 
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? 
Sweet lady, place no one above ya

I wanted to find somewhere to hide
And I opened up and left those fears inside
And I wanted to be anyone else
Only to find that there was no one there but me


But I woke up to the real life
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothing's real here, but I won't stop now until I find a better part of me


I let those hard days get me down
And all the things I hate got in my way
I could've screamed without a sound
I found myself silenced by those things they say


But I woke up to the real life
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothing's real here, but I won't stop now until I find a better part of me


That's out there somewhere
And it can't be that far away
That's where I'll find myself
And I'll find my way out
That's where I'll find out

Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I still try to stay inside


Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts


Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest




You know when to make me imagine you're here

Look at the ceiling, you ever seen stars in the Wraith?
And I can be part of your day
Pardon me, where do you want me to take you today?
They want to take me away, fuck what they say, it's okay


We used to be best friends 'til we started sexin'
What's next girl, 'cause it's up to you
Can we still be best friends after what just happened
It's a bad thing, but it feels so good
You was like my best friend, you was like my best friend
You're my best friend, girl what's up with you
You was like my best friend, my best friend
Even though we're sexin', let's be best friends too


While we on the topic, let's talk about it
You gon' find somebody better, yeah shawty I doubt it
You knew I was ballin', you was tryna scout it
You just played the sideline, I was tryna out it
Pulled up in the Audi, I did it proudly
Put them diamonds in my mouthpiece, smokin' loudly
At this moment she realized she couldn't live without me
Told her, ""Hop up in the sky before this shit get cloudy""
Don't you doubt me, 'cause I be spendin' dividends
I been out and switchin' into them different Benzes
Got my dollars up and dipped and onto ya friendses
Rollie on me, presidential like the president, bitch
Only you know I won't try you, why would I try to?
Every city that I fly through, I try to fly you
When you look just like the pictures I just can't deny you
Now let me beat that pussy red like it was bangin' Piru
Girl you know I wanna dine you, I'ma line you
Fuck around and make me wanna put you in a spiral, hit your spinal
Touchin' you like I was tryna spin a vinyl
I just slip and slide through, sicker than some swine flu
Yeah, come do it all for me, 'cause I do it all for you
Whenever I need it I'm fallin' through
When I need to get it I'm callin' you
You know you got it
All of the numerous rumors are probably true
Something I'd probably do, I gotta be honest with you


Best friends
What's next girl, 'cause it's up to you
Best friends after what just happened
You was like my best friend
My best friend, girl what's up with you
My best friend, even though we're sexin', let's be best friends too

I lay awake tonight, because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me, I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feelin gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Huh - reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter, cause I want you that much
The situation is a no-win, cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, of fallin for his girlfriend
I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
Its like a trap that I'm sinkin into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin cause I'm thinkin of you
Then we make eye contact, and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel posessed by you
I have these thoughts at night, of undressin you
Its kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't, so he keeps on trustin me
Leaves me alone wit you, while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me, with this temptation?
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin - you're sayin to come over
What do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
Its gettin rougher cause I suffer from a burnin heart..
My burnin heart..


Girl, you are my one and only
You are my angel, and now ya wanna leave me lonely
What did I do? Baby did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken, and now ya make me sad
I remember, when this love affair first started
We was so in love, and now we are departed
Girl, I'll buy ya anything ya heart desires
I have to let ya know, baby you're my fire
Warm and wet, each kiss is prolonged
It's your sweet caress that makes Rock T strong
Just bein with you, and seein the two of us
Walkin along the beach, cause girl you are my peach
So sweet and tender, my love I surrender
No need to pretend, that you'll want it to end
I'll never let you go, you're forever my girl
Ya know why? Cause girl, you are my world
My burnin' heart..


Totally tounge tied, every three seconds I keep watchin you
He's my best friend, but I can't help clockin you
How could this be? How could we both love you
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
I could forget about you, pretend that we never met
But when I'm here without you, I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks that reinforce the bond that's already there
So many times I find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
Play the role like you don't matter, he swears that we hate each other
But in reality we can't wait to taste each other
You're my addiction casue I fiend for your desperately
I stand here fantasizin, because you're next to me
What can I do, with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal, so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times, I know where every curve is
I think you reads my mind, and so I'm feelin nervous
I wana tell you how I feel, but that wouldn't help
It would only cause problems so I keep to myself
Even though, it drives me crazy, to see you sittin with him
A tear rolls down my cheek, because I see you kiss him
I know the words you're sayin before they can be said
Hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
Wouldn't hurt the brother, for anything in this world
But damn I fell in love with his girl - my burnin heart, heart, heart..


My heart is burnin, ya know it's yearin, for ya sweet caress
I lay in ecstacy, as you kiss and rub my chest
You know ya love me, why must you deny yourself
What I can offer you, yet you want somebody else?
It's not that - well then girl, what could it be?
I hope I'm good for you, cause baby you're so good for me
Many nights I cried and tried to make this work
Then act the fool and cool and cruel like the church
Well I'm sorry baby, I have to let you know
You are my life my strength I refuse to let you go
You are so beautiful, baby you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream of that you'll become my wife
Day in and day out, it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
I love you cause honey, you're like a work of art
You got me on fire - my burnin heart..

Got the seven year itch, girl

Touch it, touch it, touch it

Hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right
They're playing out a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
Always taking, baby, but that's okay

The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace


Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load


We are screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace


So you wait it out, bideyour time
Rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it, but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever, then I tell you I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down, give me love!


California knows how to party
California knows how to party
Keep it rocking
Keep it rocking

This goes out to my homeboy 
If there ain't no justice for the dawg
Ain't no justice whatsoever


Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? See the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears


Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord


Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

And shed so many tears

And shed so many tears

Living out my dreams, I feel like I ain't slept in fucking weeks
Just to think this come from what I speak
Got my stain in this game, from stacking bread and pimping whores
Know I keep it low-key like a motherfucking midget door
High school I was pitching pills, a couple niggas did the raw
Sitting on a couple P's this rap shit was the other door
Yeah nigga chose it, now I got these hoes open
I fuck them, they tell they man their phone was broken
And I'm blowing on that potent whipping in the seven like it's stolen
Lots of niggas tellin´ me and my team was showin
And I'm riding east side till the spokes break
Leave the studio for a motherfucking smoke break
Get your main ho to come through for a throat break
Doin niggas like Richie
I'm Alpo, you don't know AZ, nigga


Cause there ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, he scared to look, he shook
Catch a nigga on the late night
While he with his bitch like Cam at the brake light
Cause there ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, he scared to look, he shook
Catch a nigga on the late night
Why a nigga slipping like Harold at the brake light

In blue suede shoes

Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel world
And you
Are livin' proof

But you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swooned


I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like, the limelight

Open the cap, and become blackened

Spent all my racks, spent it on crack

What is authentic faith?
The cultivation of an optimistic outlook on life with a kind of spirituality attached to it?
A holy hoping for the best?
Is this how you think of faith?
Authentic faith is the confident assurance in events not yet seen
Faith is not a call to believe in things when common sense tells you not to
Faith is not a mindless stab in the dark
It is not a crossing of the fingers and hoping for the best
It is not a leap into apparent nothingness
It's a word that speaks of reasoned, careful, deliberate, intentional thought
Thought upon what? God and his promises
If you are absolutely gripped by the coming realities that have been promised to you by God, then how you live your life in the present will be radically different than if you did not possess that certainty
This is what faith is, my friends! Positive certainty expressed in action
Authentic faith is not merely believing in God. It is believing God
Taking God at his word, living in obedience to his revelation whatever the cost because you know down deep in your bones that God will always do what he says, that his speaking is his doing
It is an abiding assurance in God and his promises that animates you to persevere in your obedience to Him
Do you wish to be a more consistently obedient, steadily persevering Christian?
A stronger Christian?
A more courageous and outspoken Christian?
Then you need to strengthen your faith!
Your faith instinctively strengthens in direct proportion to the expansion of the object of your faith!
You expand your understanding of the object of your faith and faith itself will obediently follow
The object of your faith--if indeed you are a Christian--is Jesus Christ and all of his promises
Is your faith weak?
It is owing to the fact that you don't know the object of your faith well enough
But when Jesus Christ becomes progressively bigger, or better yet, your understanding of who he is progressively conforms to reality, your faith will become increasingly stronger
But how does that happen?
By immersing yourself in the faith-arousing Word of God
Read of Jesus Christ!
The same powerful Word that long ago brought the universe to life is the same Word that can bring you to life and furnish you with a faith that is truly and authentically Christian

Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion


A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion


Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky


Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion


Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky


Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion


Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky 
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky 
Ain't no place I'd rather be

I don't know what to say-ay-ay, when I see him
I get the chills when I look in his eyes - he’s so beautiful
He’s everything and more when I see him every day
Hoping he feels the same, am, am - he’s a keeper

"My love is like first steps in this snow, baby
I follow you everywhere you go, baby
The pain as light has come to wake you
But you will never realize
That I inspire the dreams that guide you baby
I follow the winds that bring the cold, baby
I light a fire in your soul, baby
The lightest touch of feathers falling
My love might be invisible
But I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby
You're a half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
Your satellite
Your singing satellite
Your satellite
You're a half a world away
I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that God sends
I'm flying high on my red eye
And winding down the windows
My future is a valentine
Stolen in the perfect crime
And I know I'm living out of line
But with a blazing smile I'll die
You're a half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
You're a half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
You're a half a world away

And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite

Hush, ancient purr
I swore off obsidian thoughts
And lay awake on broken glass
I bled out more than once
I drew the poison out


The scavenger feeds in hum of low sea
Cast-off exuviae in fragility
I kept my head down and bit my tongue
Until I tasted love


Rare form at the casement, for which I burn
Perfect psychosis, noiselessly whirrs
Then hear the reflections, the words they demean

Said you wanted to feel beautiful
And did I ever tell you differently?
I tried to give you all that you deserved
And never mind the things you said to me
Along the way I didn't say all the things I felt inside myself
You took away all that I thought was mine
And then you gave it all to someone else


You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie


Everybody told me I was crazy
But you told me to believe your lies
Guess I was hoping that your love might save me
But I think I died a thousand times
I never knew this side of you
The side that I wish I had never seen
Soon enough I guess I would discover I had a lover that could be so mean


You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me

"We all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone thru
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do

She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home

As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground

The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do

When the preacher began to console us
His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that's the reason
That there was nothing we could do

And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep

And I turn my head back to the room

Let me be clear, I ain't here to please men
If I was then I wouldn't be a servant of Him
I'm shocked how quickly we turn from the real faith
They want to discredit my ministry, say I'm real fake
I'm like Paul, I got called on my way to Damascus
Commissioned by Christ to go preach to the masses
He wasn't a disciple when Christ took the lashes
And since the Twelve didn't know him, they questioned his passion
But he preached a gospel that was grace related
Not another from the Lord, and these Judaizers hate it
False teachers come through like wolves in disguise
And some of my closest boys believe these lies
We know those who teach this other gospel is accursed
And you followin' these teachings don't benefit the church
The application: I'm not bound to your traditions
Free from the law, to the Spirit I'm submittin'

Say bear some fruit 
Say bear some fruit  


Why you tryin' to rebuild what you once destroyed?
The contract's abolished, the law's null and void
It's no longer I that live, but Christ that lives
I no longer have the same priorities, you dig?
Since I understand grace, man, things have changed
If I'm justified by my works then He died in vain
'Cause there's no fury known like the Savior scorned
Tryin' to produce another veil after the first was torn
A promise was given before the law even came
But because there's a law doesn't mean the promise has changed
But what the law does do is shows we needed a promise
The Seed of Abraham, to Whom we pay homage
The application: if all this is true
How can I go back to the things I used to do?
You can read more, share more, do more things
But it's only through Christ by which you please the King


They talk about the law, they talk about the law 
They twistin' the law, they twistin' the law 
The law is a tutor that leads us to Christ
By faith justified, He gives us life 

They talk about the law, they talk about the law 
They twistin' the law, they twistin' the law 
The law is a tutor that leads us to Christ
By faith justified, He gives us life 

Sanctified by the Word for the Word is truth
Be filled in the Spirit and bear some fruit
Say bear some fruit 
Say bear some fruit 


They want justification by the law they've fallen from grace
They pretty much denied that Christ even died in they place
Eagerly await the hope of righteousness by faith
With faith fulfill the law with love, not hate
But I hate my flesh, it's bad for my health
Gotta serve my community while dyin' to myself
'Cause myself is nothin, but a thief and a liar
But Christ crucified my passions and desires
If I'm trippin' in community your boy's gon' hear it
Gotta restore that cat with the fruit of the Spirit
Without submittin' to the Spirit your boy can't grow
And just tryin' to do more, man, you reap what you sow
The application: walk in the Spirit in every situation
I'm crucified to the world, I'm a new creation
And just as Christ is the Architect to salvation
The Spirit is essential to sanctification 


Let's walk in the Spirit, so we don't gratify the desires of the flesh
Say bear some fruit 
Say bear some fruit 
Say I got love, I got love, I got 
Say I got peace, I got peace, I got 
Say He gave joy, He gave joy, He gave 
I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be

I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide

Can't be in one room with you and stand on different sides

Jumping countries like a bunny

I felt the pain but you took it from me
Now that you changed I trust nobody

Guess you want me sober now
Started out delusional
Now I'm getting older now
Guess I'm getting over, how
Did I do it?
They just wanna pick my brain
All along I've been the student
All along He knew the Judas
Never posing like I'm closer to Jesus
But he chose to move in
I don't think he's planning to leave us
I'm tryna finish strong
They want another single
I want them to sing along
I'm wanting their hands high
They keeping 'em so low
I'm wishing they stand by
Stuck staring down at their phone
Looking up at my goals
The ambition is all mine
But I'm thinking this next time
I'ma do it on Paul's dime


It's double denim, cold salami, and this tilted mattress
It barely talks a conversation now
To kill the magic
You say you still don't think you're living
Like you still in brackets
You slide in and out of moments
Like a silky fabric
And I'm the same way, afraid nothing will last
Cause it hasn't yet, and I can't tell
If that's just in the past
Get your mans, going, life's too fast
And it won't slow down on you
Even if you ask, and that's facts
I'm reading lips and taking dinner cheques
And actin' like I just meant nothing by it
I'm scrubbing stains off of my shirt
Beside the 
And going over every moment
When we sat in silence
Mediocre conversations
About the places that you been
What you want from of education
How 'bout you call me when you make it
Cause this thing here ain't what you chasing
I tell 'em

Showed me how to laugh and how to cry
It introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady

It brought us close together
I guess it broke her heart
But it opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be

On the road without a friend
Can make you feel life's loneliness
In a voice that rides the wind
Streaming 'cross the airwaves
In a simple country song
The one that you don't hear
Until the moon is full
It was Texas once again
The one about the good old boy
Who's caught remembering
Images of childhood
And the places that he'd been
Caught up in his questions
Wondering where it would end


Another midnight on the highway
Dallas in the distance
Seems I'm always leaving love behind
Singing along with someone
Who's soul is on the radio
Sounds like me and the good old boy
Are two of a kind


Bedding down in a cheap motel
Puts you in touch with an emptiness
That players know too well
It comes on strong when you drop your boots
And sit up on the bed
And try to keep your thoughts from dancing
Around the room
So you fumble with a line
Until you hear that melody
Singing sad and sweet
And there you are again with him
Somewhere down the line
You're feeling just a little bit better
When you hear his guitar whine


Another midnight on the highway
Dallas in the distance
Seems I'm always leaving love behind
Singing along with someone

One fine summertime Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin in a purple samurai Suzuki dookie braids was an aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope, man, real dope on the real
Well anyway I went toot toot she said hey a beep beep
The next day rolled down to the beach, deuce deep
Me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin on my booty
Suck suck suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular 
Cuz everytime I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like ""Quit, B""
Bitch was frontin' but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden as if someone pushed the button

Too much of you is never enough

Without a single thing
I gave into your ways
Which left me with nothing
I've given into smiles
I fell for your games
I wish so bad right now

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my brain


I scream without a sound
How could you take away
Everything that I was
Made me a fucking slave
Your face that I despise
Your heart inside that's gray
I came today to say
You're fucked in every way

Now the pale morning sings of forgotten things
She plays a tune for those who wish to overlook
The fact that they've been blindly deceived
By those who preach and pray and teach
But she falls short and the night explodes in laughter
But don't you come here and say I didn't warn you
About the way your world can alter
And oh how you try to command it all still
Every single time it all shifts one way or the other


And I'm a goddamn coward, but then again so are you
And the lion's roar, the lion's roar
Has me evading and hollering for you
And I never really knew what to do


Now I guess sometimes I wish you were a little more predictable
That I could read you just like a book
For now I can only guess what's coming next
By examining your timid smile
And the ways of the old, old winds blowing you back around


And I'm a goddamn fool, but then again so are you
And the lion's roar, the lion's roar
Has me seeking out and searching for you
And I never really knew what to do


Sometimes I wish I could find my Rosemary Hill
I'd sit there and look at the deserted lakes and I'd sing
And every once in a while I'd sing a song for you
That would rise above the mountains and the stars and the sea
And if I wanted it to it would lead you back to me


And the lion's roar, the lion's roar
Is something that I have heard before
A children's tale, the lonesome wail of a lion's roar

I fell in love with you
Long before I knew
What it meant to give everything up
I was a rolling stone
Rolling my way along
Till you came
And made sense out of everything


But you couldn't wait
I couldn't promise you anything
If it was all a mistake
Then I guess we're both to blame


I could've been
So many things
But it would never be enough for you
I was the one
You counted on
But I was never the one for you
Now I know
I lost you a long time ago


City of strangers
Out of danger
In your arms I was half awake, half asleep
Grab a hold to what I've got
Regretting all that I'm not
I couldn't be the one who'd stand by your side


If it was all a mistake
Then I guess we're both to blame

Now what you do is press rewind on this muthafucka
And you gig, that's how we do this y'all, thug style


Tell me, baby, are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, Love, tell me
'Cause I get caught up in the life I live, it's hell, see
I never thought I'd see the day when I would calm down
You ain't heard? I've been known to clown and get around
That's my word, see you walkin' and you lookin' good
Yes indeed, got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match, right?

A crap game, ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations going...



Give 'em the finger!

And all my homies going

Give 'em the finger!

And you know what, baby, it's like...


I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?


Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in
Gettin' high, I can hear the people callin'
I'm passin' by, everybody knows I'm ballin'
And to God, gotta keep myself from fallin'
But it's hard, all the cuties know I'm under pressure
What do I do? Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up
And say it's cool, should I stroke
Or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper
Some dirty words in your ears as I kiss ya
On every curve, slow down, baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...



Give 'em the finger!

Yeah, you know what time it is
All my homies going

Don't be heartbroke, baby, don't be heartbroke
Give 'em the finger!
That's just the thug in me, girl, you know
But peep out how my homies do this shit...


I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?


A lot of people think it's easy to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me in every town
I don't want 'em but I gotta do it
The temptation got me ready to release the fluid
Sensation, sit down and conversate
Like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
A quiet spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was...



Yeah, you know, thug style, baby, thug style
Give 'em the finger!
Don't be mad at me, throw your hands up
Yo, this how we gonna do this, y'know?
We gon' freak the funk, freakin' it, you know?
Ay, but peep this, this how we run game on 'em
Check it out though, it's like...

I sat on the hillside
The stars up above me
Like pinholes in velvet
I listened to the song
That I hoped I'd never hear

And off behind me
Guns snap like insects
We're fighting for causes
We don't really fathom
But we'll charge ahead
Bloodied hands feed the flames

Their guns all rain down
Say your prayers, fall and run
This is do or die this time
Raise your fist, give 'em hell boys
Let's make them wish they'd never lived

My eyes locked with a boy on the other side
Hands dropped, he stood defenseless
But he wasn't frightened
His face was accepting
But I couldn't pull
I couldn't pull, I couldn't pull

And I could see it clear
To fall was not my fear
To make one fall was

And the chaos returned, I backed into the trees
Left my guns on the ground, wiped the mud from my knees
And I knew in my heart that my old life was gone
That in walking away, my name was undone
So I might as well run

Parts and bones and strings of secrets cut the ties that bind me
I might dream myself as king, but I ain't made for ruling
Just live another day, and I can find another way

And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday

Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die

Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine


Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year

Anything you could do I could do better
I can do any I can I can do any I can I can do anything better than
Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
I can do anything better you


Lego! I was the man on guard yeah couldn't tell me nothing
Smooth operator mic check pushing buttons
Seeking fame I was insecure somebody love me
Going backwards in my life call me call me Benji Button
Seek what I want yes sir got to have it
I don't care who it belongs to baby I'm a grab it
Coveting another undercover it's a habit
Tragic how this envy can turn you to a savage
I can do anything better than you
I wish I had what you had just a measure would do
Come bite the fruit ya it's good sin severing you
And now your wife ain't good enough any new one would do
Or your car or your job yeah your life seem wack
If it is the good life you still wanna give it back
But envy is sin and it will take charge
So don't be blind to the key like your boy Ray Charles


Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
I can do anything better than you
Anything better any anything better
Anything better any anything better
Anything better any anything better
I can do anything better than you


Yeah, Tedashii, my verse is...
Yeah...
Look now I been doing this a lot lately some undercover hating
A brother progress I give no congratulations
Maybe it's because I want the spot God gave him
Supposed to make Him famous while I wanna defame men
Crazy compliments are hard for me to say
I can't stand the thought of someone else getting praise
Wanting all the glory for myself what a shame
In the end it's really in vain like heroin
Check who I'm addressing no Vera Wang buddy
I thought we was supposed to be the same team funny
The Pharisees said Jesus did the same thing
When He tried to point 'em to the Father
On the tree's where they hung Him
Mark fifteen ten, yeah, see the heart of that sin
Only way to beat it through repentance and confession
Men fight for your joy killing discontentment
If you be satisfied in the sufficiency
Of the Lord then you are loving the next man




They ain't heard my verse yet...
Let's just admit it.... I'm better... hahaha
Simply you having more than me just offends me
Sends me after that capital like the Shift key
I'm Nevada, Sin City in the state of envy
You get it right? Like the the Ne... Whatever
They trying to be rich less I'm richer than you
The fun in number 1 is the point that I'm up in front of 2
I hate it when praises go to another dude
I grind to the T  to stay in front of U 
They should of put me on we raw..
You feeling me though right? Okay
They should've put me on me raw for eons
I'mma need my compliments with E-S-T or E-R
It's best or better when it's prime time I'm Deion
That's why I get excited when I heard you slipping off
I'm a B alphabet but I ain't been alpha yet
Then I realized I had it all wrong like Malcolm X
My entire life is entitled tied up and tired
Trying to acquire these titles with a wire for something higher

We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life

And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open

Let's kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?

Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day

Wish I could come home from workin'

Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her

Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town

I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my

"Lying on the shady grass
Afternoon, there's always something happening
Friends go floating gently by
I'm listening to a song inside my head

Although the summer's past
Those mythic dreams would never last
Do I care anymore?
And if it makes you sad, remember all the things you have
Can't be bought

Recollection brings me back
Sad to think it was just a fantasy
We'd already accepted that
Which many others struggled to believe

And though it makes no sense, I know there are no accidents
I have no fear anymore
And if it makes you sad to give up dreams you've always had
That can't be bought
It just can't be fought

Looking back at '91, reflecting on those things we could have
Said and done
This dancing lights across a crowd remind us of another town
That's dead and gone
It's just dead and gone
It's just dead and gone
It's just dead and gone

Take me to that summer past
Tell me, is it really worth remembering?
I realize that music then
Was really just a song inside my head

And though this fun has past
Those mythic dreams are meant to last
I have no fear anymore
And if it makes you cry, look ahead, dry your eyes
It can be done
Yes, it can be done

You know that we’re rocking the computer, Stephen Hawking
And if that bitch hangs up on me again you know I’m walkin

You’re a massive black hole and you say that I’m the asshole
When I saw you at the last show, you were on me like a shadow
Up the creek, no paddle; tell my Mommy and my Dad oh I ain't never comin back

Face down in ceilings couldn't pull away
Pray for me my soul does take

Just faith I'll pass twenty seven
Broken at the source
Let me be your singing corpse
Singing corpse


I have this dream where I cut out my tongue
So I can't make promises that can never be done
Brittle strands become threads
Breaking fast as the dead spreads

Dimmi un po' perché
Ogni notte sogno che
Trenta donne del West
Sono tutte contro me!

Tu le baci, tu le stringi e non sai
Nella notte, quanto male fai...
Io mi sveglio e mi accorgo che
Sto piangendo, sto piangendo per te!


Tu che piangi non sai
Che le trenta donne del West
Hanno il viso che hai tu!

E di notte, quando sogni di me
Non svegliarti, ma continua a sognar
E così, io ti bacero
Anche quando non saro qui con te


Dico la preghiera
Quando vien la sera
Il nostro amor
Viva con noi sempre!


Corre il fiume nel mar
E io corro dove sei tu!


Questo bene, che morire non può
Ha un segreto che spiegare non so
E un tesoro chiuso in fondo al cuor
Che si chiama, che si chiama amor!
Che si chiama, che si chiama amor!

Uh, yeah
Tell 'em how to sell it
It's propaganda


Don't tell me how to keep my composure
It ain't over till I get me some closure
Wanted dead or alive is my profile
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace
Severely a mental disorder
Where reality is highly distorted
Psychosis - weaken the mind
Incline to small doses as we approach this
Ever endless quest for a vengeance
While those who expose and pretend this
Life is just a big bowl of cherries
A bunch of fairies screaming to be scary


It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again


I'm a maniac, a hard one to handle
You better come packing more than a scandal
Fucked over for the times I've been grateful
Fucked over led to times I've been hateful
Main attraction, fuck you in your pussy mouth
Cum again, friend, now we got some action
On and on is the name that they gave me
And your misery came here to save me


It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again
It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Fuck yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again


Mommy!
Fuck it!

"It hit my mind, it came to me
In order to live its got to be freed

And all I want
Is this grace undone
Its haunting my head now
Like a prodigal son

Like a dog tired sage
You know I couldn't wait
I want to set this place aflame
Frame by frame

A lingering vision burning my memory
A scorching scene dying by the sea

Like a dog tired sage
You know I couldn't wait
To set this place aflame
Frame by frame

It didn't take long
To see it gone
Look at what I've done
I've seen it, want to feed it
Burn it down and just free it
I need it now
I need you right now

Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault


I don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue


Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think
Must be Buffet's fault


I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop-top
Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Hang on


Wasted away again in Margaritaville

Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame

You, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue
And I, I think that you
I think you’re so cool, babe
Loving everything you do


You say we’re gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway


Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we’re going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down


You know what I want
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip gloss
How you get so hot?
You’re making me crazy
Hoping you’ll never stop


You say that we were meant to be
We’ll be together finally
Flying around and I’m finally free




We’re on our way


Why do I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you’re the boss
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble’s all over now
Because you’re my man


You don’t know what you’ve done to me
You’re heavier than heavenly
Life on the run has set me free, me free now


We’re on our way...

You tell me not to worry
Because you’re the boss

Little beads of light were dancin' off the wall
Reflectin' off the spinning crystal ball
In a dance hall down in Texas, where time slowed to a crawl
Baby, it's just you holdin' on to me in the middle of it all

That place in my universe
To me you're every dream I dream
The air I breathe, my everything
A ray of sunlight shinin' down
The point my life revolves around

And here we are like Heaven only knew

Here comes the nigga with the ruff, the terror
The paranoid, gots to get the boy
Get your steel cause I feel like a headbanger
Yeah I got a gang of shits, styles guns
My Uzi weighs a motherfucking ton
Bucking down one, bucking down two
Bucking down your crew, muthafuck you
Pigs wear blue, I wear black, nothing but black
Cause Goddamn it's a brand new payback
Fuck Pat Sajak, never did nothing for a nigga
On the trigger the zigga the zag the nickel the bag
The nigga the sag the forty four mag got you running like a fag
So, keep your muthafucking jokes
Cuz, I'm that nigga with a fresh pair of locs
No yokes but smokes
Crakers and them dirty mackers friends aren't jackers
Get yah for your drawers, young niggas out to kill for the cause


Ice-T in the motherfucking house
L.A. Playa


O- to the muthafuckin G, I break crazy
A lot of niggas hate me but they can't fade me
Stop me, clock me, cops wanna Glock me
But the punk motherfucking pigs can't stop me
UHH, am I a G? I got proof
Banged in my youth, keep niggas on the roof
With a scope, dough, Cube keep the rope
2Pac'll string a nigga up if the mob don't
So whats up, punk? You want what I got
Step to me wrong fuck around and get shot
Your moms crying fuck her bust her
Bitch start screaming to me and I'll dust her
Pops got the LP phat, track on hit
Laid by the muthafuckin' Bobcat
Ninety-three suckas want me to go out
Throw the ho out, bitch muthafucker, I'm rich


2Pac's in the muthafucking house
Nigga I'm loc'd, 2pac's gonna get'cha motherfuckers
Got any last words


Now they're after me, why?, cause a nigga's Black
Spittin' facts and ain't afraid to pull a trigger back
Let em come step to a real muthafucker
 Mama ain't raised no suckers
Dan Quayle, don't you know you need your ass kicked?
Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?
Muthafucker rednecks all the same
Fear a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dread, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand, divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us all
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place 
Keeping the smile off they White face
I ain't racist but let's trade places
Trace the hate 'n face it
One nigga teach two niggas
Three teach four niggas and them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast that'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz

I look up to the Sky tonight it's beautiful
Remember to breathe, remember to see it all
Before I will forget 
Am I home yet? 


When I get lost in myself
Oh memories where did you go
I've lost all I've ever known
Forgotten the one place I've called home


Snowblind
This is the snow across my mind
Snowblind
The snow which will make me blind


Board me up
Sew me into the sheets
Fill me with coal and ice
Until the wind retreats
My organs can live without me
You can't predict the end


When I get lost in myself
Oh memories where did you go
I've lost all I've ever known
Forgotten the one place I've called home


Looking closely at the stranger in the mirror
Who's this ghost staring back at me
Please forgive me, please believe me
Cause I'm far too afraid to tell confinement in a dark cell
There's nowhere to hide
No ones ever seen me like this
On a motion to dismiss
I need to understand
That I'm a broken man


When I get lost in myself
Oh memories where did you go
I've lost all I've ever known
Forgotten the one place I've called home


When I get lost in myself
Oh memories where did you go

"Some time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt, I was walkin' into World War III
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say
He said, ""It was a bad dream""
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though
They were my own dreams
And they're only in my head
I said, ""Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain""
He said, ""Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane""
He grabbed my arm, I said ""Ouch""
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said, ""Tell me about it""
Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast
It was all over by quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wonderin' who turned the lights on us
Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wonderin' which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parkin' meter
And walked on down the road, it was a normal day
Well, I rung me fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell
""Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man""
Shotgun fired and away I ran
I don't blame 'em too much though
They didn't know me
Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man, I said, ""Howdy friend
I guess there's just us two""
He screamed a bit and away he flew
Thought I was a communist
Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
Say, ""Let's go and play Adam and Eve""
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
When she said, ""Hey man, you crazy or sumpin'
You see what happened last time they started""
Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody aroun'
I got into the driver's seat
And I drove down 42nd street, in my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war
Well, I remember seein' some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didn't work so well
Turned on my player
It was rock-a-day, Johnny singin'
""Tell your ma, tell your pa
Our loves are gonna grow ooh-wah, ooh-wah""
I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
""When you hear the beep, it will be three o'clock""
She said that for over an hour and I hung it up
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Sayin', ""Hey, I've been havin' the same old dreams
But mine was a little different you see
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
I didn't see you around""
Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody's havin' them dreams
Everybody sees themselves
Walkin' around with no one else
Half of the people can be part right all of the time
Some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can't be all right all of the time
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
""I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours""
I said that

I met a little girl who was so high class 
I was as lonely as can be she had a beautiful
She was lonely
She showed me her tattoo it was right there On her breast
Somewhere in a city in the middle of the West
When she asked me to her house
Little did I know she was only
She was just 18 still living with her folks
She was only
And when I met her momma she undressed me With her eyes
Then her daddy gave a look at me
That could have paralyzed
Because your mamma wants to do me and your
Daddy wants to do me in
I'm a cat with nine lives I hope that I
Can make it to ten
O'cherry please forgive me for confessing
My original sin
Because your mamma wants to do me
And your daddy wants to do me in!
In the morning as I gingerly tipped toed
Down the stairs, I had this deja voodoo
That maybe I already had been there
Then it all came back to me that night back in 1973
It must have been yo mama Lord have mercy on me

No landlord to throw us out
I want to play in your garden, baby
When you want it give me a shout
I won't tire
Take me higher
Building a house of fire, baby
Buildin' it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch

We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
That you can't tear down
Brick by brick the flames get higher
Build it strong with our desire
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
That you can't tear down
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
That you can't tear down

Did I approve for you to talk to me?
Motherfuckers like you, hell, I preach it to 'em
First hand I teach 'em no psychic, bitch
Hell I reach it to 'em
No bus no fuss dogg, no sucks in the Lex, dogg
Don't see no checks dogg, and stop beggin when it's wet, dogg
But you could bet dogg
That you don't know no hoe that'll hide the work
Two clips inside the purse
Fuck me I'ma ride you first
Fuck hard till the condom bursts, but umm..

I need my pussy Lee tight figero
White gold with the X and O's
You putas betta know Trina is a betta hoe
Oh you don't know?


When we hooked up
We sat down
Made an agreement
We vowed that
That we'd always be together
Through whatever
We said that no one would ever
Get between us
So love would never ever leave us

That was a while ago, oh

But now lately
It feels like
I mean like I feel like
All we do is fight

Every single night
Can't make it tight
Can't get it right
I just wanna go back
Take it way back
All the way back
Can we start again?
Do it over
Can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?
Cause


I don't wanna be

I don't wanna live

I don't wanna go

I don't wanna be alone

Do you realize
I can't sleep without you
Think without you
Eat without you
Speak without you
Be without you, I can't even breathe without you
I can't feel without you, deal without you
Spend without you
My whole world is upside down
Don't wanna go out
Cause I can't ride without you
Feel like I'm gon' die without you
What is a girl supposed to do?
When I spend my last dime to be in your life
I don't wanna be without you

 - 2X

How can we not see
That it's not working out
We vowed to be
Always together
It's hurting me
That we don't talk no more
It wasn't supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong?
We both made mistakes
We gotta carry on

 - 4X

I don't wanna be, no

There's a curse upon your home
There's a sadness in this room
There's a ghost behind the wall
Trying to call to us


And you try to run, but you can't
And it knows that you'll escape


There's a weight behind this door
Great shadows from above
There's a face that's looking out
And it calls to us


And you try to run, but you can't
And it knows that you'll escape
And you hurry to escape
But it seems to know your name


And it wants you to let go
And it wants to come home
And it wants to remind you
That you're running out of time
And it wants to remind you
That you're running out of time




I want you to let go

In a high rise penthouse suite over the beach
Got a bad bitch, butt ass, massaging my feet
Bumping DeBarge through the iPod, I'm nodding to sleep
My homey Miz caught a charge, his bid start in a week
Valet garage, got eleven cars parked in the street
One of the few so elite, it's an honor to meet
Obama physique, groomed well, garments is sleek
Have a chick so in check you got to con her to speak
Don of the week, centerfold magazine style
Fuck Kenneth Cole, everything is Japanese now
Love dinner rolls, lemonade with iced tea mixed
Who's on beginner mode? I see through the sheisty shit
Politely flipped, handsome, slightly mixed
Random broads come aboard, few might see dick
Fights we fixed, it's a handful whose life's legit
Said it before, mahphukkaz, yeah life's a bitch


This is for the homeys that did it and got away with it
Still around and talking, lounging, never lost it
Built they own fortress, living the life
Four wheeling or they peeling on bikes

Kickstand the Kawasaki, cooling it off
Switch hands, the sour got me, I'm cool as the frost
Shower properly, smelling like a jewel in my north
It's only right like a midnight 2-2 Porsche
Dual exhaust, buck-60, fleeing, burning the clutch
Ballers is never talkers, they just learn and adjust
The jeans is crushed, double stitched, creased in the front
So go figure, ne-er nigga could teach me to stunt
Reach for the blunt, the reaper ain't release in a month
No sleeping, if you're scheming you'll get beat to the punch
Retreat to the Trump, feet up, fruit in the bowl
How many ever minked up and drop the coupe in the cold?
The view is controlled, the watchers just work and contribute
Only certified fly guys flirt with the visual
Circle the menu, main course pick of the day
Get yours, what else for a nigga to say?

What I hate most in this life is a long night
Four walls and no calls, and no lights
But the moonlight creepin' through the blinds
Ceiling fan on high spinnin'
I'm beginning to believe that tonight is the night
Dead by dawn
I'll shred my palms to the end of my arm
I'm spread and gone, embalmed
Put me in the dirt where I belong
Existence is overrated anyway
Fifty years later, they won't remember you're dead
Six billion people living as civilians, and I hated them all
I should have been a vermillion reptilian living in a swamp



Enter the void with my wrist shackled up
Codeine and water that fill up my cup
Visuals glisten when I get fucked up
Rehab's for quitters and I don't give up
Cockin' the nine if you wanna act tough
This all by design, I don't have any luck
When it comes to them dollars, don't make me get buck
Hollow tip showers when I go and bust
Tell me the reason you wanna be us
I'll tell you good riddance and then get the fuck
Used to fuck bitches in back of the bus
Nothin' has changed, bitch, I'm still bustin' nuts
Always complainin' 'bout bitches and love
When I don't feel nothing, no, not even lust
Triple six demons, in Satan we trust
Killing these motherfuckers is a must

Go sell some dope, pimp a bitch, hit a lick or something
Remember Grandma asked me, ""Boy, you must be rich or something""

The type to introduce you to your bitch, then take her from you
Nah, we don't do no drive-bys over here, we walk up on you

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young


But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
Two two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped


Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young


Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
You ain't shit without your homeboys


Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young


Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at 8D, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggas be together
Ain't shit without your homeboys

I just need some time; I'm tryna think straight
I just need a moment in my own space
Ask me how I'm doin', I say ""okay,"" yeah
But ain't that what we all say?
Sometimes I think back to the old days
In the pointless conversations with the old me
Yeah, back when my momma used to hold me
I wish somebody woulda told me


If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love


Yeah, as a kid I used to think life
Is moving so slow, I watch it go by
Look out the window on my bus ride
I thought the world was so small, through my closed eyes
I've always tried to control things
In the end that's what controls me
Maybe that's why I'm controllin'
I wish somebody woulda told me


If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love


The older I get, I feel like I'm always tryna save time
Talkin' to the voices in my head, they make me think twice
Tellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right
I'm scared that one day I'll wake up and wonder where'd the time go
Talk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow
I'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own
And tell 'em


If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
I wish you woulda told me
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
I wish somebody woulda told me
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
You gon' have to give

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then

If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone

If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer

His mama's a crackhead, his sister's a bloodhound
His daddy's a jailbird, so he can sit full now


Everybody I know, around my way still there, 
Waitin' for a miracle to pass them by 
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
Yes I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
Cause it's the way to get by, 
It's the only way to get by, 
Cause if I had a choice aside from this life, God knows I'd try


In the same jeans everyday, hustlin' for the gwap
Day in and day out, hopin' I don't get knocked
Keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
My finger on the trigger, hand on my nine
By any means, I'm playin' for the win
Momma told me to slow it down, or I'm goin' to the pen
Fuck it, I gotta get it, it's a must
Cause it's grimey out here
Tell me, who can I really trust?
Me, and only me, I'm strapped up and on one
Niggas out here know I ain't takin' shit from no one
Little niggas, big niggas with the llamas
And anyone else who want any type of drama


Everybody I know, around my way still there, 
Waitin' for a miracle to pass them by 
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
Yes I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
Cause it's the way to get by, 
It's the only way to get by, 
Cause if I had a choice aside from this life, God knows I'd try

"It's a quarter to three, there's no one in the place
Except you and me
So set 'em up Joe, I've got a little story you outta know
We're drinking, my friend, to do the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I got the routine, won't you drop another quarter in the machine
I'm feeling so bad, wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
Could tell you lots, but you gotcha be true to your code
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me
Until it's talked away
Well that's how it goes, and Joe I know you're getting anxious to close
So thank for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
This torch that I found, must be drowned or it might explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
One for baby
One more for the road
That one long, long, long road

I hope that you will just let it go by

I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
By all I have done wrong

You better learn how to raise your hand if you wanna come here and talk to me
I rock a bus pass cause you know that talk is cheap
Can't make a living driving shit just like colostomy

Upset the dead when we're in the graveyard dropping beats

Should I say yes and match his best

Love had its day

You've gone away

Gets rid of the pain of being a man


Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own 
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention


As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free


Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? 
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own

Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem


Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today


Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Though we go through trials and tribulations, yes

And I've stressed you out
And really get you fed up
I ain't never never gonna let up
Unless it makes you happy for me to shut up
But I ain't shutting up, because I really wanna give it to you
I can't replace the feeling when we get it with each other
And I ain't trying to lose you

Come on, maybe we can spend some time together

No more of anything, anything, anything but the rain

I found black magic and white shame

Where Damen and Division meet
Been dodging bullets and dirty looks all fucking morning

Afraid of everything, everything, everything and the shame

Lost in confusion and disgrace

Locked in a prison, in a world of living fear
On the edge of my destruction marching on

As I lie awake and curse the rising sun

And this pain in my heart for no reason

A star is gonna be born
A star with the stature of a Harlow
Who's doomed
And groomed to enrapture
All her co-stars, and stuntmen, the co-stars

On the arm of a dumb marine
Her beauty looks out like a trailer
Norman Mailer
Waits to nail her
He's under the bed
And he's waiting for her to be dead
He's out on the patio
With his polaroid and scenario
And he's armed and he's dangerous-


-ly close was the weather
When I was a kid
She gave me a feather from her gown
To cool me down, to cool me down
And I was the galley slave
Who lost his heart when the ship went down


Lights, action, sound
Roll 'em


I had a part in the talkies
When you were a little girl
I've taken Lassie for walkies
When she was the pup
That Vaudeville threw up
And destiny lead her
Hand in paw to
Somewhere in Hollywood

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I would’ve gone slower
Pushed infrequent
Would not have rushed into such commitment
I would’ve shown restraint as my feet got wet
I would’ve baby-stepped into intimate


This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
Torturous hindsight if I knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse won’t repeat with my understanding
This wouldn’t have happened if I knew then what I know now


I would’ve known much more
Known that time was all we had for future depth to unfold
I would’ve had more faith at every step
I would’ve kept intact through the whole process


This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
Torturous hindsight if I knew then what i know now
This mountain of remorse won’t repeat with my understanding
This wouldn’t have happened if I knew then what I know now

"Out of tune
It's no ideal
Cannot prove
But I can squeal

Stick into
Frozen meal
Touching you
Magnetic field

Take the loo
Bruise the fruit
Forget what to say
Call your bluff
Get away

Clear the room
Watch them reeling
Sex is soon
But first the feeling

Out of tune
It's so ideal
Clear the room
And watch them real

Take the loo
Bruise the fruit
Forget what to say
Call your bluff
Get away

I came staggering in, in the middle of the night
I got my alibi sewed up nice & tight
Cracked the bedroom door, I tried to keep it from squeaking
'Cause I know there's a wildcat in there sleeping
But the, the light was on & the bed was made
And there's a dear john written on the pillow case


She said I've gone to the Bahamas
I've had it with the drama
Time to get out of town
I'm just a slowing you down
She said I found somebody that likes
The things that you used to
Yeah & he's got a lot of money
We're going where it's sunny
& baby he's a looker too
She said it was a chance of a lifetime
What was I supposed to do


Oh yeah, I woke up this morning in a terrible mess
I had the telephone ringing & her cat on my chest
I'm wiping the sleep out of my bloodshot eyes
It's gotta be her calling to apologize
She must be feeling bad 'cause she done me wrong
Then I pushed the button on the code-a-phone




Oh & I got the stereo
And she got the music
Yeah & I got this washer
But I don't know how to use it




Oh yeah, it was a chance of a lifetime
What was I supposed to do
Maybe you can come get this cat

Burned out and broke

Run up by the age of 13
We was gunnin' and it was fun to see the police runnin'
Niggas disappear when we comin'
Little, nappy head shorty head addicted to drinkin' 40's
My niggas is naughty and y'all niggas is fuckin' corny
But you left me in the summer of '89, a very good year
Crack cocaine sales rose in every hood here
'Til you got knocked
Then locked down, bag of rocks & fat knot
You shot down, what they tell me is you livin' well
Stuck in your cell
Don't get another slip, ticket, drinkin' liquor in jail
Just as well, hell nigga, I bail, whenever needed
There's weed inside of the cereal box so don't eat it
Where you been nigga? My homies wanna know
Where you been nigga?  Where the fuck you been?

And went to fill the halls in my shadow
But everything costs
Proof was etched into the backs of my hands


I heard you say that you'd lost, you'd lost, you'd lost, you'd lost your way
But I don't think you had much to lose

And I ain't gonna let them paint the truth with sin
And I ain't gonna tell you it's okay when at the end of the day

Couldn't tell if you were crying or laughing
They both sound the same
When you ain't got no skin in the game
So I took up the fight
And the roaring in my head was like thunder
Until I uncurled my fists
And allowed myself to not give a damn

I pounded on a farmhouse
Looking for a place to stay
I was mighty, mighty tired
I'd come a long, long way
I said, “Hey, hey, in there
Is there anybody home?”
I was standin' on the steps
Feeling most alone
When out comes a farmer
He must've thought that I was nuts
He immediate looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts


I fell down
To my bended knees
Saying, “I dig farmers
Don’t shoot me, please!”
He cocked his rifle
And begin to shout
“Are you that travelin' salesman
That I have heard about”
I said, “No! No! No!
I’m a doctor and it’s true
I’m a clean-cut kid
And I been to college, too”


Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped out of
La Dolce Vita
I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad
And told him what a
Nice, pretty farm he had
He said, “What do doctors
Know about farms, pray tell?”
I said, “I's born
At the bottom of a wishing well”


Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie
He said “I guess you’re tired”
He said it kind of sly
I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles
Today I drove”
He said, “I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove
Just one condition
You can go to sleep right now
That you don’t touch my daughter
And in the morning, milk the cows”


I was sleeping like a rat
When I heard something jerkin’
There stood Rita
Looking just like Tony Perkins
She said, “Would you like to take a shower?
I’ll show you up to the door”
I said, “Oh, no! no!
I’ve been through this movie before”
I knew I had to split
But I did not know how
When she said
“Would you like to take that shower, now?”


Well, I couldn’t leave
Unless the old man chased me out
Because I’d already promised
That I’d milk his cows
I had to say somethin'
To strike him very weird
So I yelled out
“I like Fidel Castro and his beard”
Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs
Sayin', “What’s that I heard you say?”


I said, “I like Fidel Castro
I think you heard me right”
And I ducked as he swung
At me with all his might
Rita mumbled somethin'
'bout her mother on the hill
As his fist it hit the icebox
He said he’s gonna kill me
If I don’t get out the door
In two seconds flat
“You unpatriotic
Rotten doctor Commie rat”


Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest
At my head and I did run
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers
Rita said, “Come back!”
As he started to load
The sun was coming up
And I was running down the road


Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back
There for a spell
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job in a motel
He still waits for me
Constant, on the sly
He wants to turn me in
To the F.B.I
Me, I romp and stomping
Thankful as I romp
Without freedom of speech
I might be in the swamp

The book of Acts is clear
Man God is all around like the atmosphere
The tactic here is for you to get a piece of this matchless
Love that covers you up like a sheet on a mattress
It's above the average, His blood is captured
Wrath intended for us, so what can match it
So why would I even grab bub and crack it
Knowing the sons will be crushed when He judges our actions
And what happens when your platinum plaque is gone
And all the money is blown like a saxophone
You know what we on, we gon spit the bars for Him
Regardless of ends, and pray your heart is hardened to sin
So, miss me with the tipsy bit
When wickedness falls down like some pixy stix
I'm spitting this, so get the drift
We're different
Cause we've been to Romans 6:6


It's simply on the basis we wanna please Him
That's the reason we don't do the things to grieve Him man
He died for us, that's an abundance of grace
Without Him you'll go nowhere fast like you're running in place
Plus if you can't tell I've been bent on the light
Hoping the events of my life will give you a glimpse of the Christ

So I'd better get my story together
Got to make it good she's no fool
I'll take her in my arms, I'll be cool
Don't want to get her upset
I wanna make her forget
Take me where I wanna go running
Where the sea rushes up to the shore
It's a lonely place but I need the space
Want to let my feelings soar
Help me find the key to my prison
I've waited long enough to be free
I love you but I'm not really living
It's now how I want it to be
This girl's she's a real survivor
She don't believe in the midnight driver
So she's starting a brand new day
She say, hey, don't wanna play
It had to stop, so I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away

"Me and my Annette, we was as fond as we could be
We was set to marry in October '33
I set my sights to courtin' her, as fine as she could be
I never ever noticed her best friend Marilee

Took a job at the saw mill and I bought my girl a ring
Had a pre-wedding party, close friends and family
Everything was fine, eatin' homemade ice cream
I swear I never noticed maid of honor Marilee

And my sweet Annette was left standing at the altar
My sweet Annette was left standing at the altar

Marilee was taken ill, it was several miles from home
Back then it wasn't fittin' for a girl to leave alone
Sweet Annette, she asked me to walk her to the door
As innocent as children back before the war

And my sweet Annette was left standing at the altar
My sweet Annette was left standing at the altar

Lord have mercy for what we done
Lord have mercy when two people get alone
Neither one of us had done anything like that, you see
By the next sunset, I had eloped with Marilee

You shower but you're not clean

It causes you to change

Let knowledge drop
Why should I be forced to play dumb?
I know where I came from so I'm going to claim some
But rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
Suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
Stop think of the past the brothers that die for
Sucker to try for never to cry more
Tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
He's a fake not a friend
So he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
Yo he's a trick so he sold his soul for gold
Now I know the reason we must excel
Cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
Move on be strong with unity
Cause that's the only way to build communities
Lies are told but yo lives must move on
And never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop


Drop that 
Let knowledge drop


Yo I'm running so I refuse to stop
Get sweated by them sell out cops
And I wink cause I pin the opposition
I'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach
So listen up to the flavor I gave you now dropping it
We folks know ballers know no stopping it
Dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
I got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm
For the simple fact that I'm black and educated
Proud of who am I and you hated
So all I have tried for this many have die for this
You see it and you hear it and you loving it
Now you buying this always keep your head look to the mountain top
Aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop


Drop that 
Let knowledge drop


Suckers suffocate when I hype this because you can write this
You constantly bite this
Thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
Caught with the dope dose
Now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
Cause you building a boom force
Like what you hearing so your checking with the source
2Pac brother with the rhymes to rock on
Dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
Amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
Suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
I'm not conceited but defeated I won't be
As long as there's dope beats I'll never be lonely stop
And let me breathe a minute
Aiyyo Dizzy what's up put the base back in it


Let knowledge drop 


By any means neccessary it's kind of scary
Knowledge of the hands of adversaries
Makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
I was waiting for a present GOD gave me a goal
I refuse to be busting like a sucker for I'm fighting like a titan
And run you down like a truck
I'll take a chance I vote for rock can see
Not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
Knowledge appealed to me
Pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
The bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
And knowledge drops


Drop that 
Let knowledge drop
Strictly strictly yea dope

Disappointed, over-extended and frustrated and shaken
This over-giving , over-loving, this care taking goes on
With no chance of intermission

Here comes the feeling
I run from the feeling and reach for the drug
Can't sit with this feeling
I'd rather be flying and comfortably numb

I am the world that hides the universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime
I've lived 1000 times, I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images, the unborn child that never was conceived
When little worlds collide, I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories are cast into the never-ending well
The name that scorns the face, the child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that belies the fate of those who never ran


You gotta believe, yeah, I'm talking to you
Well, I know it's hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand more when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on
I want you to listen, I'm trying to get through
Love has given life to you and now it's your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still, I look, but not to touch the seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls, the secret stays unknown




Just remember love is life and hate is living death
Treat your life for what it's worth and live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned, but now, I'm wondering
Here, I wait and only guess what this next life will bring, haha!

All you need is a promise that you gon' be a big nigga
And you'll sell out your people on a promise that the enemy will never fulfill
Keep on your feet

This is the cry of a people
Who were robbed and raped from their homeland
And their loved ones
A people stripped of their culture
Their dignity, their liberty and their rigths
And by the cruel and presumptuos
Hands of the colonial and imperialistics slavers
Were cargoed into the west
Where for over 400 years they have toiled and laboured
And with their blood, their sweat, them tears and hands
They have built the great city of Babylon
Only to be paid with the wages of the taskmaster's whip
Torture and death


Oh yea yea! This is my history!
Oh yea yea yes! Oh!


We've been down in the valley much too long
We've been down in captivity oh so long
We've been down in humillity much too long
We've been down in slavery oh so long


But we're gonna rise and shine 
And win our liberation
For now is the time
When all nations must be free
So rise and shine 
Restore your strength and power
Waste no more time
Remember your history


We've been down in a sufferation much too long
We've been down in a condemnation oh so long
We've been down in a segregation much too long
We've been down in humiliation oh so long


But we're gonna rise 
As the morning sun that surrounds you
It's international morality time
Where mankind must be born anew
So rise and shine 
For the sake of the younger generations
Putting hearts and minds
To brotherhood and unity


Oh yea yea yea yea yes!
Remember the slavemaster's ship!
Remember the taskmaster's whip!
Oh yea!


We've been down in the valley much too long
We've been down in captivity oh so long
We've been down in slavery much too long
We've been down in humility oh so long


But we're gonna rise and shine 
And win our liberation
For now is the time
When all nations must be free
Rise and shine 
Restore your strength and power
Waste no more time
Remember your history
Yes we're gonna rise and shine!

I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


Cold hands, red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
I don't know what came by me


Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines


I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could, they’d say


Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines


I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

I said the walls have ears lil' nigga, I hear when you talk
Let's get this shit clear lil' nigga, I run New York



I wake up, stare at the ceilin', I'm alive, what a beautiful feelin'
I put my vest on, right after I put on my draws
It's a habit I'm always prepared for war
See, my life's like some shit you seen in a flick
Bitches act like porn stars when they sit on the dick
When I was gettin' out the game I said one more flick
Test my aim in the range I'm like one more clip
It's my brain, I'm insane, I be on some shit
Man, I run Interscope, Jada's tryin to annoy me
He's nothin' but another disgruntled employee
Been in the game ten years, and he still ain't rich
Even his momma upset that he still ain't shit
But he keep runnin his yap like I'm a take all that
One more word out his mouth I'll push Styles shit back
See, the nozzle on my trey pound is three inches long
And the kick on the four-fours is extremely strong
With a lil' trey deuce it's like pop, pop
Chase his ass up the block till his bitch ass drop
And them verses he be kickin', none of 'em hot
'Cause he ain't got none of that shit he sayin' he got
And he ain't did none of that shit he sayin' he did
And I ain't got, time to be talkin' 'bout this shit, fuckin' faggot!!!!


I gets busy lil' nigga, I run New York
Yeah, I live in CT, lil' nigga, but I run New York
I don't go to parties, lil' nigga, but I run New York
And I stay gettin' cheese, lil' nigga, 'cause I run New York
Yayo, tell 'em I run New York


My money longer than yours, nigga, call your recruits
The LOX made more money in them damn shiny suits
The game about sales, drugs and rappin'
Jada, fuck your punchlines, my shirt went platinum
Styles and Sheek Louch, went double plastic
Yayo, Buck and Banks is puttin' out classics
A hundred shots, a hundred clips, y'all ready to die
Fat Joe ain't a gangsta, he scared to fly
Automatic Mossberg who want a piece of this pump
I'll have Ja Rule buried, in some high heel pumps
Vest up in the bulletproof man fuck that
Homie shoot up my whip, all you leave is a scratch
Yo, I flip cocaine in your project lobby
And beat you with my pistol like Kane did Chauncey
It's T.O.N.Y. Y.A.Y.O
My whole clique got dough, my hoes on the fly home
G4's, we fly on Lears
And my rocks lookin' like flashlights in my ears, nigga


When I'm in D.C. lil' nigga, I tell 'em, I run New York
When I'm out in Philly lil' homie, I run New York
When I'm in V.A. I tell niggas guess what I run New York
When I'm in N.C. niggas holla at me cause I run New York
Yayo tell 'em I run New York


Yo who the fuck told this lil' nigga he can talk to me like that?!!
If I catch him I'll bawl him up and roll him somewhere, ha ha ha ha!!!!

Could find you or could bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her


You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you've seen in dark time
Let me love you, let me touch you

I remember every moment every memory
Sipping on you fuck sipping on the Hennessy
Have you living in the hills, out in Beverly
Yeah we coulda been forever been a legacy
But you tryna fight  claiming that we enemies
Thinking 'bout the jealousy forgetting all the chemistry


Whatever happened to together till we 70
We moved apart girl  now we living separately
I remember you, can’t you remember me
Loving you my speciality , you my secret recipe
You helped me find my self a part of my identity
My love my oxygen to me you a necessity
I hope this reaches you if not its my serenity
Bars on my mind like I’m convicted for a felony
And ahh that was a hard time
Its been a while since we talked its been a long time
I been on my phone, checking if you online
Stalking up your page, wonder if you’re on mine
Been a couple years, thought that I'd be over you
Still hold the tears, when I think of holding you
You left and disappeared, I can’t get a hold of you
I can’t believe you’d me wrong
Was someone else controlling you?
'Cause after all the times, everything we been thru
Every time you lie , I’d always defend you
When I saw you cry, id just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple
So tell me did you love me? Or did you pretend to?
Every time you touched me, was it even special ?
Was I priority ? Or squeezed into schedule
Baby you angel same time you the devil

Every time you lie , I always defend you

Got a brand new girl, so I'm feeling all good inside 
Feel like I put some brand new twenty-fours on a brand new ride 
Triple shot of Patron on the rocks with little bit of lime 
I'm just keeping it real 
Baby still working at the club, so I'm getting in free 
Wednesday night, I'm on the list: T-Pain plus three 
Every time I hit the spot, baby girl taking care of me 
How do you think I feel?
Ooh, she made us drinks to drink
We drunk 'em, got drunk
And now I know she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back
And then I think that we 'gon have fun at my spot tonight


Shorty, I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out 
Unless I'm in the M6 doing tricks, freeway burnt out 
Got a passenger side that's empty, wanting it to be your spot 
Put you on my billboard, we can act like the charts; I can end up on top 
Don't smoke, don't drink: that's why I don't be by the bar, baby 
Just lookin' at you from a distance looking like a goddamn star, baby 
So, my girl don't see me; T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car? 
'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie, and I'll see you tomor' 
Ooh, she made us drinks to drink
We drunk 'em, got drunk
And now I know she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back 
And then I think that  we 'gon have fun at my spot tonight

Imma start firing firing firing but
If a nigga try me
Imma start firing firing firing


Wish I can turn back time
Hit pause and press rewind
Feel like all the real niggas dyin'
Lord forgive me cuz I'm tryin' but
If a nigga try me
Imma start firing
Tell my shooter grab the choppa
Nigga start firing
If a nigga try me
Imma start firing
Tell my shooter grab the choppa
Nigga start firing


What the fuck you 'pose to do
When yo stomach keep talkin'
Lil sister need school clothes
You clutchin' on yo forty
Voices in my head
I can't seem to to get 'em off
One sayin' stay loyal
Other tellin' me to cross 'em
Everybody say they bosses but
They really all for self
Got me thinkin' to myself
Ain't no real niggas left
Cuz all the real niggas left
They either dead or down the road
Niggas goin' out bad
They'll kill you bout a ho
Man these streets so cold, so cold
I swear these streets so cold, so cold
I pray to god that he watch my soul
And let me know whose a friend or a foe




RIP to Johnny B
He died right in front of me
He was sittin' in the driver seat
I was sittin' in that passenger seat
Lil Larry got shot
Man my nigga Crucial too
Got me wonderin' in the streets Like
What i'm 'pose to do Like
Who i'm 'pose to trust Like
Who i'm 'pose to fuck Like
This bitch set me up Like
Imma wet her up
They gave my right hand man life
Nigga I got real stripes
I remember cold nights
TJ lost his whole life
I can't take no mo of life
But I can't let go of life
6 shots i made it out alive it's 21 for life

"Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside;
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go, and I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so

But when ye come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead and dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an 'Ave' there for me

And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me

Been here before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving


Wherever I may go, whatever I might be
I may not stand alone but I am standing tall, ten toes two feet
I've never been a pushover, never asked for a handover
Worked nine five, broke day and night, if you only knew what I hurdled over


Been there before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving


Ready to take blows, suited ...
... my hands are bruised but I am still gonna stay true
Motivated by ... and the names I salute
Unbreakable I made it through and there's so much more to do


Been here before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Apologize for the weekend
And pray to God that we'll be friends
A little lost when it's over
But it's all good when I'm sober
Burnt out but I'm focused
If I was gone would you notice?
Philosophize in the shower
Ash a cigarette in the flowers


When all you felt has frozen underneath your scars
Just know that I've been gone for a while
When you realize you didn't need me
All the ghosts we've left behind
Just know that I'll be gone and you won't need me
I've been gone for a while
When you realize you didn't need me
All the ghosts we've left behind
Just know that I'll be gone and you won't need me


Apologize for my old ways
And pray to God that we're okay
I didn't know you were golden
'Til I tore your heart open
And I'll be home for the weekend
'Cause outside's been freezing
And everything that I wanted
Was everything that you needed


When all you felt has frozen underneath your scars
Just know that I've been gone for a while
When you realize you didn't need me
All the ghosts we've left behind
Just know that I'll be gone and you won't need me
I've been gone for a while
When you realize you didn't need me
All the ghosts we've left behind
Just know that I'll be gone and you won't need me


And I've been wondering how I'm losing sleep
It's looking like you were fine for me
No matter where my soul is, I won't try
To fight these feelings every night
And I still got every right to breathe
I'm out here on this road
I've been on to something new
Still, for what it's worth
Fuck, if I know what I'm doing here
'Cause I've been holding out for something
And you've been left with nothing
This weight that's on my shoulder
It's why I'm acting colder 
I'm holding out for something 
With my luck, it's just nothing 
These feelings in your movement 
I'm wondering how you're doing
I won't sleep no more, no more
No more, no more, no more

You'll rescue me, right?
In the exact same way they never did
I'll be happy, right?
When your healing powers kick in
You'll complete me, right?
Then my life can finally begin
I'll be worthy right?
Only when you realize the gem I am


But this won't work now the way it once did
And I won't keep it up even though I would love to
Once I know who I'm not then I'll know who I am
But I know I won't keep on playing the victim


These precious illusions in my head
Did not let me down when I was defenseless
And parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends


This ring will help me yet
As will you, knight in shining armor
This pill will help me yet
As will these boys gone through like water


But this won't work as well as the way it once did
Because I want to decide between survival and bliss
And though I know who I'm not I still don't know who I am
But I know I won't keep on playing the victim


These precious illusions in my head
Did not let me down when I was a kid
And parting with them is like parting with a childhood best friend


I've spent so long firmly looking outside me
I've spent so much time living in survival mode


This won't work now the way it once did
Cause I want to decide between survival and bliss
Now I know who I'm not I don't I still don't know who I am
But I know I won't keep on playing the victim


These precious illusions in my head
Did not let me down when I was defenseless
And parting with them is like parting with invisible best friends

Fuck it tho I ain't got time for this shit



What would you do if I passed the assist
Most of my life we can't manage this shit
Tryna be a preacher and a pastor and shit
Wonder when I die what happens after this shit
I got into a fight and had a box cutter try to leave a nigga like a pizzeria
It was 12 AM and everybody sleepin' now I'm in the crib doin' Santeria
'Cuz I need them Benjamins
Look to the people, tell David let him in 
The rockers of ganja 
We got the shit that be breaking the glass like it's opera
Tats on my skin the ink it was there
But I love the fucking pain nigga
Smoking so much weed a nigga can't even see think I'm fucking going insane nigga
Addicted to paranoia 
This is a sign of creativity
Like I'm looking in the sky then I wonder why damn weed really hittin' me
Forget about the hate and the pain and most of all all the misery
And it's a mystery
To get the 4 kids and the dog to try to figure me lil' nigga
Stoic Stoic


Yeah, That's word to my F yo I ride for this shit

Them niggas I rode with they ride for they shit

Them niggas I roll with is trying to get rich, when we rich
Pull up on every bitch that ever fronted when we ain't have money
Now I ain't got time for this shit

I can't do no 9 to 5 no
Move that work just like I'm Alpo
I would never drop a dime tho
Put that on my nigga Quado
Fuck around and crack a shell I ain't talking snails treat a nigga like a lobster
If my nigga need that bail money I ain't got it then I'm playing cops and robbers
Put a nigga under
I ain't even fronting
Nigga I ain't stutter I'll fucking pop ya
Only time you hear a stutter when that choppa bust and it go ba-ba-blocka
On some real shit wanna know when the last I fucking cried nigga?
After niggas killed my bro Quo they just left him in the store to die nigga
That's the reason why my niggas carry heats and always keep it on the side nigga
King Ceazar, Trippy Rell with my nigga Flair YFN those

I don't dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart you see
But I can't help it


And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with a splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter


And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella

I'm frustrated by your apathy


And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I am humbled by his humble nature, ya

Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred?

Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness
And the sound of pretenses is falling
All around, all around


Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here, can you handle this?

Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're going to die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?


And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer


And all I really want is some peace man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength

And my niggas say
We want the fame!
Come on! Come on!


One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
It's been nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame


Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
I know, death follows me, but I'll murder him first
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
I'm the first one to want him blasted
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fake in fame


Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' Henny
Drunk nights, and hot days
Cockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways
A life on the run, full of common blunts
Unconditionally married to my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires
Be pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance
Searchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame


One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
Something we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
It's been nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame


Searchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain
A lost of the game, with life is the cost of the game
We forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain
All the blame belongs to the part of the brain
That we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain
And if I ever lose, homie, bet I'm at it again
Outlaws don't die, so united we stand
And if family come before, all the fortune and fame


As I walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head
Say salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down outta town, I sent him a kite today
Man, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg
Prayin' for my downfall, and I can sense it, dawg
I was passed down the street fame
Like Glocks clocked and keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box
And I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded but still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart
And that's some game that I got from generation of game
In the road of life, dog
We need to switch up lanes – think about it!


One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Been nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame



I can't complain, I've seen my fair share of the fame
It won't change me, now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange, I got so used to the hood
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby, still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me, I made myself
Poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health, my mind, and my family too
State of myself, my grind, and my family crew
Where one hand washes the other
No, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers
The struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build
And that remains the same 'til the day that we killed
And that's real, life that I was aimed to be
Love by my family tree, that's fame to me – how about it?


One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame

Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine? One summer day
That same night be on your way
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
Seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were saying the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn


Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

Destination seen unclearly
What is a man deep down inside
What a raging beast with nothing to hide

I sat on my hands
I don't make a sound
Getting it right
I made all my plans
Lost, never found


Your eyes, your smile can light up the night, night
Embers and neon signs paint up our sky, sky


Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly, we'll never die
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire, rising up higher
I've got something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city, woah


All of this time
I questioned myself
I never could wait
Looking for signs
Not asking for help
I know it's too late


A love lost and buried here, it comes to life, life
Make believe worlds make us all feel alive, live

Like angels can fly, we'll never die
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams set on fire, rising up higher
I've got something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city, oh

I won't fade into dark
I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry
Gonna see the end of this story

So here it is for you
It might be late and I know you moved on but I've thought a lot about you
I know I hurt you and I should have externalized
The feelings I had, in a way you always compromised
Everything for me, that you did I loved
But I just got upset cause you could never love yourself

All I hope is that you found yourself
And I know that you’re doing alright
And just know even if I'm bitter
You'll always be in my life
But I know that when you’re with me
You were lost
So lost

Now I'm sitting in here down in Atlanta
Last year you were crying to me cause you could barely get up
In the morning now I feel the same way
A years gone by and a lot has changed
I couldn't deal with the issues you had
Even when you were with happy, you were always sad
Now I see where you're coming from
Now I see where you're coming from
I went from the top of the mountain
To the bottom of the hill
And every single time I try to climb
I get brought down and I think it's a sign
But I'm really walking a really thin line
What if threw away what's mine
Was I wrong or am I right
I guess I’ll know in time but I know you were the first one
To sing my melody
You sang my melody
You sang my melody
You sang them

So right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream ""peace"" after they start some shit
Pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you, then I run a train on Mobb Deep—don't fuck with me!
Nigga, you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well
Hell, how many niggas wanna be involved?
See, I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies




When we ride on our enemies

Make sure everybody die
When we ride, on our enemies


When we ride on our enemies

I make sure everybody die
When we ride, on our enemies

You got the notion, a motion, conclusion that will set us free
It takes us closer and closer, the human that we want to be
Imperfection was a strife we couldn't handle but we tried it all

From the notion of emotion
I will wake up when I've learnt to fall
Breaking the spell, the appearance of perfection


It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot out like a gun
Hit and then we run into my breakdown
It's my countdown


Give my injection, the poison, let's believe that's all I need
I can't describe it the picture was too sharp
We couldn't get it off - no!
A description, my prescription, I can't handle but I've tried it all

From the notion of the motion
I will wake up when I'm already gone
Breaking my shell I initiate deception


It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot out like a gun
Hit and then we run into my breakdown
It's my countdown


Vanity is my profession
Follow my lead letting it free
My seduction, I count down
Vice is my obsession
Cellar lobotomy act as my remedy
Sell me self-deception
My addiction


It's my obsession, the pressure
To be a slave for what I trace
I force it higher and higher
The dose I need to inhale, oh yeah
I want to swing around in hell
I'm gonna scream and shout it out in vain

Be aware that I will wake up if I'm not already dead
Breaking the spell, the appearance of perfection


It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell into my breakdown
It's my countdown

 
It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell into my breakdown

Trace the hidden spell into my breakdown

Passport is stamped from sightseeing the map
And to think, I'm asleep but won't blink

More like a lifestyle in the rawest form

And I've felt the stings of love's burning pain
And I've felt the happiness of those around me
But I've never felt the touch of love's sweet hand

The tender touch of love and understanding
That makes your body trembling with true love
They say oh that words could not describe it
Oh but I've never felt the tender touch of love

Though I've felt needy hands say ""I love you""
But when the need is gone, they turn away
And leave my heart with emptiness inside it
The hands of hurting touch the empty place

Through the home that might have been

In a house that might have been

That love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore than never knowing

But I got what i came for
And I'll do it until i drop
You do what you want to do
I ain't never going to stop

You say you got something that
Makes you feel good
And you can't stop messing with it
All your life you've been
So misunderstood
Because you can't stop messing with it

Sitting by the seashore
Dreaming about a little more
Circling the classifieds
Nine seven six
Man I need another fix
I'll never have to kiss the bride

Yeah, the city is a war zone
This country gone to hell
And the beer cans in the alley
From the rich folks on the hill
They're screaming hallelujah
But I don't give a damn
Because I got my own religion
Yeah, it's right here in my hand

You say you got something that
Makes you feel good
And you can't stop messing with it
All your life you've been
So misunderstood
Because you can't stop messing with it

When the stars outside are shining bright

To give a

Be yourself and don't put on a show

Hey yeah
To see your face
Just to melt into your warm embrace
Nothing on earth can take your place
Hey, got nothing to sing, hey hey
To get where you're going
You're gonna need someone
I'm willing to share my love
Under the sun

Hey hey baby!
It's good to be here
Home again!
Just to see your smiling face!
Just to melt into your warm embrace!

Verse 1: 
You know I like it when you get low
Bouncing up and down like it's a rodeo
Hotter than them chicks in the videos
From your pretty head to your pretty toes

I know you like it when I hold tight
Every little touch feeling so right
Baby I can spend the whole night
Dancing here with you under the low lights

Pre-Chorus:
Something bout you makes me wanna lose control
I can feel it in my body and my soul
Girl the way that you're dancing, and moving it on me
Got me hooked can't let you go
Feel the rhythm feel the flow

Chorus:
Right to left, left to right
I can watch ya shake it all night
Face is tight and your body's just right
Put it on you tonight I just might
Left to right, right to left
Babygirl you look so hot to def
Break it down but you don't break a sweat
I can keep up, make you lose your breath

Verse 2: 
You know I like it when you whine slow
Dancing like you're giving me a private show
Glowing under red lights but I'ma go
Cause your giving me the green light so I'ma roll

I know ya like it when ya feel me
Pressing up against you, you're a lil freak
In about an hour girl I will be
Giving you my love on top of silk sheets

Raise a million bucks that'll last a while
Fight at parties buy a horse
Lose a couple win that big divorce

Anything to be in the headlines

Took the biggest float in the rose parade
Got jailed, got disgraced
A hundred million people saw my face

Call a conference with the press
Announce my marriage plans in a wedding dress
Climb a building at six-below
On New Years Eve without a stitch of clothes

As long as they spell my name right
I hope they catch my best side

I popped out from a cake
At the president's ball what a big mistake
Fifty guns aimed at me
I was nearly killed but what publicity
Nominated, something big
Stole the hottest scene says the Globe and Tribe
Porno movie comes to light

Keep my sidewalk star status bright

No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine

When I really start to break it down

Barking on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath

Ulterior, the failing of words
A pageant to leave me bewildered
Lurch at the sight of the clandestine ascendancy
Pervading anima
An awe-struck principle, an adytum to find our home

Long for the rapture again
Crave for the pristine light

Unfurling this truth, an orbit in sovereignty
Sown into deep darkness

Burgeoning beyond, bearing the essence of life

But it's more than I bargained for
Somebody go 
Somebody go get me sober


Yeah
They gon' have to come for me
Came out my comfort zone to be amidst your company
Somethin' about the way you never gave it up to me
But let me know that I can get it  any day of the week
If talk is cheap, well then, I'm broke
With both hands on the sweeper, cleanin' up dirty secrets
Told you don't ever give me that gushy, but I didn't mean it
Bring her home and I'ma bust it out the residence
When I get the gushy, I go dumb like the President
Yes, lawd, I'm way up, word to Sacagawea
If the gushy was a sneaker, it'd be moccasin trainer
If the gushy wasn't so sweet, I could save it for later
But every time I fuck with someone else, I wish you was there
Kinda douchey I know, how the fuck I get here
I got hoes, I got hoes, we don't need to go there
On my way out a zone, somebody gon' give me body
Pick my feet off the floor, boy, I think I'm fallin'

When I get to heaven, I'm gonna shake God's hand
Thank him for more blessings than one man can stand
Then I'm gonna get a guitar and start a rock-n-roll band
Check into a swell hotel; ain't the afterlife grand?


And then I'm gonna get a cocktail: vodka and ginger ale
Yeah, I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long
I'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt-a-whirl
'Cause this old man is goin' to town


Then as God as my witness, I'm gettin' back into showbusiness
I'm gonna open up a nightclub called ""The Tree of Forgiveness""
And forgive everybody ever done me any harm
Why, I might even invite a few choice critics, those syphilitic parasitics
Buy 'em a pint of Smithwick's and smother 'em with my charm


'Cause then I'm gonna get a cocktail: vodka and ginger ale
Yeah I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long
I'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt-a-whirl
Yeah this old man is goin' to town


Yeah when I get to heaven, I'm gonna take that wristwatch off my arm
What are you gonna do with time after you've bought the farm?
And them I'm gonna go find my mom and dad, and good old brother Doug
Well I'll bet him and cousin Jackie are still cuttin' up a rug
I wanna see all my mama's sisters, 'cause that's where all the love starts
I miss 'em all like crazy, bless their little hearts
And I always will remember these words my daddy said
He said, ""Buddy, when you're dead, you're a dead pecker-head""
I hope to prove him wrong... that is, when I get to heaven


'Cause I'm gonna have a cocktail: vodka and ginger ale
Yeah I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long
I'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt-a-whirl
Yeah this old man is goin' to town
Yeah this old man is goin' to town

There's a house down on the corner
With the porch light on
And a window I can look in
And see you're always home
Waiting for me with the lights low
In your silk nightgown
Somewhere on the outskirts
Of memory town


And past the stop-light
There's a desert where my Coupe Deville
Roars down a lonely highway
And it always will
The wind is in your hair
And we're nowhere to be found
Two spirits on the boulevard
In memory town


I can pull the shades and feel your lips
They're touching mine again
I can watch the shadows of the moon
Slow dance across your skin
Hold you in a place where lovers
Never say goodbye
Every moment comes alive
When I go down to memory town


And 'round the corner
There's an ocean where the waves roll in
And a feeling that you only feel
When love begins
We lie together in the sand
And watch the sun go down
I close my eyes and smell the warm salt air
In memory town


I can pull the shades and feel your lips
They're touching mine again
I can watch the shadows of the moon
Slow dance across your skin
Hold you in a place where lovers
Never say goodbye
Every moment comes alive
Every time I close my eyes
And go back down to memory town


There's a house down on the corner
With the porch light on
A window I can look
And see you're always home
Waiting for me with the light low
In your silk nightgown
Somewhere on the outskirts
Of memory town


Take me down
Take me down
To memory town
Take me down
To memory town

Stepped through the gate, and I'm all alone
I had chicken on the plate, but the food was cold
Then I covered up my face so that no one knows
I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble
When my mom walked into the living room
She said, ""Boy, you gotta tell me what they did to you""
I said, ""You don't wanna know the things I had to do""
She said, ""Son, you gotta tell me why you're black and blue""
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble


And my heart was pumping, chest was screaming
Mind was running, air was freezing
Put my hands up, put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight


Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer


Well, I squared him up, left my chest exposed
He threw a quick left hook and it broke my nose
I had thick red blood running down my clothes
And a sick, sick look 'cause I like it though
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble

It was 6:48, he was walking home
With the blood on his hands from my broken nose
But like every other day, he was scared to go
Back to his house 'cause his pops was home
Drowning his troubles in whiskey bubbles
Just looking for trouble
Well, there's no excuse for the things he did
But there's a lot at home that he's dealing with
Because his dad's been drunk since he was a kid
And I hope one day that he'll say to him
""Put down those bubbles and that belt buckle
In this broken bubble""


Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name

With all those suckers
Yes, those stupid mother fuckers
Who put down what we do
We stand alone with the group that's new
If I was a dwarf, I'd surely be Dopey
I'm a stone wheat thin you can not culture
Kick in the teeth a condescending frown
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down

Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down

Yeah, right about now I'd like to turn the mic over to my man
SA Martinez

I am sly in the mix I am the mix master
Death and destructor, lyric conductor
Rollin with the rhythm of the rhyme I'm rollin
?????
Tim, he leads giutar,he's got the jets
Now the b-boys rockin breakin' moves on the floor
311's stepping out and you're yellin for more
I'm hoping, I'm poetry in motion
?????
P-Nut, the bass drum is booming
And in your mouth the rhythm is booming
P to the N to the U to the T

Just fuck the has-been's and their stupid-ass rambling
Brothers saying bullshit you can't come through with
Do it in the basement no complacence
It's time to kick the fuck in
Begin to win no sin and then
Share it, declare it in the public domain
Refrain

I'd be perfectly glad if rap was a fad but it's not
So I'd thought I'd come out with a shot
Super dumb lyrics make you think I'm a clown
I don't give a fuck it's time to throw down

Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down
Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down

That's right, knockin' them down
Nineties, all of that

Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

I need a little room to breathe



I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense

My peoples sittin' in San Quentin and Clinton
Rikers Island, Rikers Island, Cracker's Island


I wake up to them rappin' tunes every afternoon
I be home soon, I see the board some time after June
Met a couple of convicts that's way beyond sick
It seem they dig my style 'cause I be on some don shit
Laid back, I ran into some brothers from way back
Those I dug we hugged, besides that, black, I don't say jack
I stay in tune with the sun, stars and moon
'Cause behind bars you're doomed if your mind can't consume
Plus spiritual pain can bring forth physical reign
And without knowledge of self how else can a criminal change?
And bein' locked up just ain't the life for me shit is way too trife for me
You're comin' home soon, sounds so nice to me
Plus you can bet I'm bouncin' out with mad props
And if I get chopped or not, baby pop

And in here it makes all end up the same from blowin' backs out
5 to 15, seein' the bean until they max out
Misbehavin', actin' uncivilized like cavemen
I witnessed brave men that gave in, sodomized and turned to gay men
Nobody's playin' drama, prisoners be posted preyin'
On some low shit layin'
Sleep, get your whole shit banged in
Hangin', plus who's to warn you
Out of the hell these inmates gone through
From three halves of a four group doubt if anyone is normal
And over all it's hard to call who would try to play you
My kid from my tomb's caught a carved spoon through his navel
Nothin' can save you, even C.O.'s'll try to grave you
It's painful to even know those who most faithful'll betray you
I lay low key, 'cause I ain't Hercules
Tryin' to get out early on work release
Prayin' the system work with me
'Cause I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot
That ain't my plot, baby pop
My world don't stop







So, until that day I'm discharged and set free, fuck who's gonna sex me
My mind's more based on makin' my next G
Now, let's see, left alone me as a juvenile, no more movin' foul
The penile possesed me with a smoother style
Blessin' my mental with mathematics to map shit through graphics
Fuck it, I ain't with hustlin' backwards
A wiser man with ideas and liver plans
More mature and for sure done saw all my eyes can stand
Sittin', tryin' to design these words of mine
To define what occurs when you're servin' time
Stress just blurs the mind
Behind bars scars are signs of hard times
I'm trappin' myself in between these lines
But I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot
That ain't my plot, baby pop
My world don't stop

Yeah, representin'

For all the fellas on lock-diggedy


From upstate to downstate

Don't stop, paw

Don't stop, paw

Verás que el futuro sonrie también


Creo en angelitos
Que me cuidan siempre de caer
Creo en angelitos
Que la vida linda me hacen ver
Y llegaré
Yo lo soñé
Y llegaré

This is ""Buzzcut Season""


I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain

Well you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway



Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good


We ride the bus with our knees pulled in
People should see how we're living

Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste



The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good


And I'll never go home again 
Favourite friend 
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun 
Play along 
But I live in a hologram with you


Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us


Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good


And I'll never go home again 
Favourite friend 
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun 
Play along 
But I live in a hologram with you

"I'm standin' right here with a beer in my hand
And my mouth is full of sand and I don't understand
Big fat fingers pointin' into my face
Tellin' me to get busy cleanin' up this place

Fourteen days I've been sleepin in a barn
Better get a paycheck tattooed on my arm
Whistlin' dixie with the dixie cup filled
With the barbecue sauce and the dental floss chill

I got bent like a wet cigarette
And she's comin' after me with a butterfly net
Ridin' on a bloodhound ringin' a bell
Black cat wrapped in the road map to hell

Pencil on my leg and I'm tryin' not to beg
Takin' turns bakin' worms with the bacon and eggs
Now they got me in a bird cage flappin' my jaw
Like a pretzel in the stars just waitin' to fall

So give me what I got to get so I can go
'Cause I ain't washin dishes in the ditch no more
'Cause I ain't gonna work for no soul-suckin jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't sayin jack

'Cause I ain't gonna work for no soul-suckin jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't sayin jack

That's right

Rockin the town like a moldy crouton
Flyin' through the air with breeze
I got a job makin money for the man
Throwin' chicken in the bucket with the soda pop can

Puke green uniform on my back
I had to set it on fire in a vat of chicken fat
I leaped on the counter like a bird with no hair
Runnin' through the mini-mall in my underwear

I got lost downtown, couldn't find a ride home
Sun went down, I got frozen to the bone
'til a hooker let me share her fake fur coat
As I took a little nap the cops picked up us both

I tried to explain I was only tryin' to get warm
I knew I never ever should have burnt my uniform
He said, ""too bad better bite the bullet hard son.""
I didn't have no teeth so I stole his gun

And I crawled out the window with my shadow on a spoon
Dancin' on the roof, shootin' holes in the moon
Aw yeah
Uh-huh

Love goes out, out like a light
Out like a flame, and you can't find it anymore

It comes back knocking at your door


It's the wheel  of the world turning around

The far distant hill will make me feel blue
Soon the flowers will die, don't let love die with them

'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you ""What's the deal?""
You're holdin' it all inside

You pretend as if you don't want me

Are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your'one game
When you can not say my name

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Whenever we talk about sun all I see is the rain
It's like looking for tears in a ocean
I'm hearing your words like the wind
They blow straight through my heart
Will you ever give into emotion?


And we hurt the ones that we love the most
Why we do only heaven knows
And I don't know why I'm still holding on, holding on


I reach in my heart to see
If your love is alive in me
But now I feel alone
My feelings turn to stone
My heart makes no apologies


When an apology's made it isn't always enough
To erase all the past in a moment
Whenever I need you the most
You always leave me behind
With a word from your lips I'm alone
You've been blind not to realize
All the love that I hold inside
So tell me why do I keep holding on, holding on?


I reach in my heart to see
If your love is alive in me
But now I feel alone
My feelings turn to stone
My heart makes no apologies
I reach in my heart to see
If your love is alive in me
But now I feel alone
My feelings turn to stone
My heart makes no apologies


And we hurt the ones that we love the most
Why we do only heaven knows
And I don't know why I'm still holding on, holding on


What I need is your sympathy
Like a light flowing into me
Will I ever give up holding on, holding on?


I reach in my heart to see
If your love is alive in me
But now I feel alone
My feelings turn to stone
My heart makes no apologies

You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God
Without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano
I can almost hear those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid


You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty

The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
'Cause the faithful man that you loved
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground


And left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty

I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
But as for me without your love, girl
I don't have a prayer

"Here's something to keep you awake; something to ponder
I present this question to you to think about carefully: Without acknowledgement of the vile, under what basis does one have to compare to bliss? The same goes the other way

It is inevitable that you will be wrong in the eyes of others

Forever it seems that humanity gets caught up in trying to distinguish deeds from sin, yet they fail to realize that the only thing they have to justify their judgment is their biases

For one person, it may be preferable to spare the lives of others for their own self-preservation
For another, it may bring satisfaction to drag others down into despair

I'm sorry to break this to you
Horrific and obscene it may seem, I can tell you this: It doesn't matter anyway

The reality is that we can't truly say one person or another has the moral compass
Yet the only thing we really have left to guide us is our perception synchronized to our flesh and mind

The strive for transcendental meaning breaks down when metaphysical ideas conflict
The nonexistence of the metaphysical is the reason why it doesn't matter in the end
The universe will still revolve without you, no matter the degree to which you can deny this truth

Laughing her way through my feeble disguise

We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues


Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by


Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us


She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues




Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next


She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Staff cuts have socked up the overage
Directives are posted, no callbacks, complaints
Everywhere is calm
Hong Kong is present, Taipei awakes
All talk of circadian rhythm

My night is colored headache gray

The bull and the bear are marking their territories
They're leading the blind with their international glories
I am the screen, the blinding light
I'm the screen, I work at night

Don't wake me with so much

I cried the other night
I can't even say why
Fluorescent flat caffeine lights
It's furious balancing

Tryin' to make my money, tryin' to become a hustler 
Finally made the status
Gladys Knight and the Pips
Snoop Dogg 'bout to trip
Catch your grip and then I'll dip
Makin' money is a must for me, I gots to have it
Cause you know my lifestyle is like 2Pac's, it's just so lavish
Just movin' on paper; movin', makin' and shakin'
Leavin' fools in a daze, as if, I was a Laker
Break 'em down and shake 'em, pass it off to 2Pac
And let him take a jump shot
Because he gon' give it all he got


Back in the old days, niggas was suckers, tried to belittle me
But that was when I was much smaller, just a little G
But now I'm a just a bigger baller
Niggas don't wanna see me, because I'm larger and taller
Made my money get bigger, bank account is larger
Niggas don't wanna see me
They label Dogg the father
When they see us on the streets, niggas scream peace
They don't want it
Cause they screamin' they ""Can't C Me""

Leavin' niggas on daze
Cause yes, money pays

Tryin' to do you a robbery, or some type of assault
But you just might get caught
But you know it ain't my fault
I'm gon' dip away and slip away
And find me a hideaway 
And look for my nigga 'Pac
Gon' and take the ride away


Well I'll be right there homie, uh
What's up baby?
You lookin' crazy like you don't really know me 
I know you heard the album, I Ain't Mad at Cha

I step back, relax
New jacks, they get smacked up against the wall
When they, think that they can get with that, nigga Doggy Dogg
I'm so smo-o-o-th , I keep it on the real-a 
Cause, I'm a true killa when it come to makin' scrilla


Them niggas know, I suppose they froze
Once they seen me and the Dogg, doin' clothes in the videos
Bitches pause, we all up in them drawers
Baby you know the secret, uh, I gots to keep it
Money, paper, and bitches, my only motto
Drink out the cold forty bottle
My dog, you know these niggas is hogs 
Now me and Snoop came up, and built our name up
Bitches thought they had us crossed, but bitch I got my game
Plus, I'm a motherfuckin' baller, alcoholic
You can ask my homie K

Feel the earth turn ’round when your heartrate slows

Observe the conscious flow and don’t mystify

Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails

From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life

Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'
Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'
Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
Figure it out, compute, understand
No problemo, I'll help you with your demo
If you go to the store for me

- What kind of accent is that?
- It's a french accent, you know, I'm french, I'm from Paris, don't you think it's sexy?

I'm sexy, and I'm french, everybody love my accent, I'm the best, yes, yeah! Je t'aime! I love you! I love you oui, je t'aime! I'll teach you french, I'll make your french good!


You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'
Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition
Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
With the French ""savoir faire"" and the sexy glance
But is she really fly, or is she a guy?
I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive, it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester

Let off a clip or let a case off
I have your pussy ass running like a race horse
Follow orders now, Yay' shoot his face off
You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
See how when you listen to me all of the cash gone
I was born with the tech, it's a birth defect
I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-not's turn into Sasquatch
Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
It's horrific, nah, it's terrific
I got it if you sniff it, go 'head nigga twist it
Get lifted, goddamn I'm gifted

Get the line on 'em and squeeze the .9 on 'em
Headshot, .40-Glock blow his mind on him
It's a hit, not a jux leave the shines on 'em
Now you can watch me, nigga, like the police watch me
I move proper, go ahead catch a shell trying to stop me
That 430 Spider, carbon fibre
And my dog is like Al Qaeda, natural fighter
Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
The Mack'll fire, mask like Michael Myers
It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop yo' ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this, a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid

If you like your apples sweet
And your streets are not concrete
You'll be in your bed by nine every night
Take your hand-spanked, corn-fed gal
And your best friend's four-eyed pal
To a treat right down the street that's dynamite
Let your conscience be your guide
If you put your foot inside
You wish you left your well-enough alone
When you got hell to pay
Put the truth on layaway
And blame it on that ole' crazy bone

On a Thursday when it's Egg & Daughter Nite
When the farmers come to town
And they spread them eggs around
And they drop their daughters down at the roller rink
Well you're prob'ly standin' there
With your slicked-back, Brylcreem hair
Your Lucky's and your daddy's fine-tooth comb
If they knew what you were thinkin'

And eternity is approachin' fast
Yeah you're half out of your head
And you prob'ly pissed the bed
And you can't see a thing to save your ass
And far across the prairie 
In the local cemetery 
They already got your name carved out in stone
When all them nurses say
""Grandpa why you walk that way?""
Just blame it on that ole' crazy bone

Don't run up on me -- I don't know you, nigga
So what you bought my CD? I don't owe you, nigga
I know you love the way the Audi's beat bumps
Got your license plate rattling all over your trunk
I confuse these chumps with my style, dog

Where I'm from, a young boy'll come and try you, nigga
Shells'll have you feeling like you on fire, nigga

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost

At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?


There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes


We all like to put the blame on society these day
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change


I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever


Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line draw between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

That's why this jungle can kill and this jungle has assassinated several people in this generation in very few years, some four or five years. We've assassinated a Medger Evers, and a Malcolm X, two Kennedys and a King...""

I'm falling down, I've had enough
This rabbit hole has got me stuck
A flickering light, about to die
When it gives out, so will I
I'm falling down, I've had enough
This rabbit hole has got me stuck
A flickering light, about to die
When it gives out, so will I


I'm falling down, I've had enough
This rabbit hole has got me stuck
A flickering light, about to die
When it gives out, so will I


The crawling out, no easy task
And when the light goes out at last
I can tell but I can't see
The rabbit standing next to me


Next to me
Next to me
Next to me


I'm running out, but off the path
Frantically searching for my way back
And now I'm lost and losing hope
And feel the breathing of something close
I must escape, go far from this
But I'm traveling deep in a dark abyss
I can tell but I can't see
The rabbit standing next to me


The rabbit standing next to me

Hey Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

: 2Pac
Now, I could make miracles to tempos
It's instrumental, waitin' for the nymphos: that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you wanna fuck me?
Just ‘cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on – still down?
Met you standin' at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?


You got to feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie, What's your phone number, Share that beat of lover Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off? I wanna rock with you 
Dance you into day 
I wanna rock with you  Hey Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

Oh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number? Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme, take time to rewind these words I say
If you open your mind, bet in a minute you'll find
It's time let the Outlawz play



When you feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie, What's your phone number, Share that beat of lover Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off? I wanna rock with you 
Dance you into day

You know that love survives

Out on the highway
Watching your heart bend to the road
Kiss your forehead as I turn to go

Following those signs
Driving out
Only engine smoke frozen in a cloud
Wishing the space would remain
You're holding back your tears
From letting go of your heart
Leaving the middle of the road
Letting go just a little bit
Till it all spills out the side of the road

Hole in the sea
Hole in the heart
There's a hole in your hand
Where the money just falls
And the pain falls right through
The hole in your head
That wears right through

The hole in all your plans
There's a hole that shines right through

Into my lap like a heart attack
Like lightning from her name

Don't want to lie or seem intrusive
But time hasn't told me anything
And neither has she

A poinsettia in poison rain
Traded true love for insult and injury
We washed it down the drain
With one silver bullet and two Vicodin

Emma woke up in darkness
Suitcase already packed
Note on the bedstand signed in blood
Sincerely, never coming back

A nightmare on my street the day she arrived
A nightmarish household in which she died
Because it made her feel at home
Somehow made me feel at home

A poinsettia in poison rain
Traded true love for insult and injury
We washed it down the drain
With one wooden stake through the heart and two Vicodin

A poinsettia in poison rain
Traded true love for insult and injury
We washed it down the drain

You went out with a bang when you took with you all my dreams underground

Watching snowflakes kiss that baby
And it makes me think

Maybe peace on Earth, no more empty seats in church
Might be what's on His wishlist

The room brought out the silence in your breathing
A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond your numbers
Let us pray to pan let in the light
And see us bathe and sleep among us
Smell the bodies of our elders
And wake up to the milky way at breakfast
I’ll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken
No real way to remember if they'll work again

'Cause they think it’s contagious
Marshmallow people say ""Oh yeah""
'Cause they think it's a masterpiece

What a good way to rise

On his side of the world they're taking their time

Goodbye

Green fly
Goodbye, goodbye

Lie in the lake while your body is broken
When you go out I’ll cry in the thicket
Shooting from school
There’s a green where the crickets cry
Mom can't breathe and I that know she's leaving
Birds on the quay are all food for the crocodile
So slow it down
It's not a race
Death takes time
Do you see it?

Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water
I roped an island pony for your birthday
I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles
And drop you in and shelter near the highway

When the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said


Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can


How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said


Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong, oh no
There is a voice inside us all
So smile, ohh, when you can, ohh, when you can


If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do


Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall

If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall

When they're gone, keep to yourself

Hung on a hook I'm a mirror
Cracked down the center I split you
Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes
Show you the face of a man who
Not that he wants but he has to
Look at the thing he's become, what I see


I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change
Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head


Pieces of me on a tile floor
Look up at you as you change more
Floating in fear I appear a hundred times
Hold a reflection inside me
I cannot feel you are empty
Throw me away
I am broken not your time


I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change
Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head


Not going to save you
Perform euthanasia

I was a quick wet boy
Diving too deep for coins
All of your street light eyes
Wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map
And called for you everywhere


Have I found you? Flightless bird
Jealous, weeping
Or lost you? American mouth
Big pill looming


Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures
Thrown in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream


Have I found you? Flightless bird
Grounded, bleeding
Or lost you? American mouth
Big pill, stuck going down

I had a little book
Was give to me
And every page
Spoke of liberty


All my trials, Lord
Soon be over


There is a tree
In paradise
And the pilgrims call it
The tree of life


All my trials, Lord
Soon be over


But it's too late, my friend
Too late
But never mind


All my trials, Lord
Soon be over


If religion were a thing
That money could buy
Then the rich would live
And the poor would die


All my trials, Lord
Soon be over
All my trials, Lord
Will soon be over

"I'm condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of light
And my shadow has life of its own
Watching you while you sleep all alone

When the night is all cool skin and bones
And you lie wrapped in sheets on your own
There's a ring on your dead telephone
Don't be scared when there's nobody home

Like a spider web kiss on your face
That familiar smell, just a trace
That's my scent that I left on your lace
So you're never alone
No you're never alone

I'm condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of light

Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon


I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you


We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save them we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
“You need to let go, you got no control""
No


I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you


This weight’s too much alone
Some days I can’t hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you
Yea when tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you

You were full and fully capable
You were self sufficient and needless
Your house was fully decorated in that sense
You were taken with me to a point
A case of careful what you wish for
But what you knew was enough to begin


And so you called and courted fiercely
So you reached out, entirely fearless
And yet you knew of reservation and how it serves


And I salute you for your courage
And I applaud your perseverance
And I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces that I represent


So you were in but not entirely
You were up for this but not totally
You knew how arms length-ing can maintain doubt


And so you fell and you're intact
So you dove in and you're still breathing
So you jumped and you're still flying if not shocked


And I support you in your trusting
And I commend you for your wisdom
And I'm amazed by your surrender in the face of threatening forces that I represent


You found creative ways to distance
You hid away from much through humor
Your choice of armor was your intellect


And so you felt and you're still here
And so you died and you're still standing
And so you softened and you're still safely in command


And I salute you for your courage
And I applaud your perseverance
And I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces that I represent


Self-protection was in times of true danger
Your best defense to mistrust and be wary
Surrendering a feat of unequalled measure
And I'm thrilled to let you in
Overjoyed to be let in in kind


And I salute you for your courage
And I commend you for your wisdom
And I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces
And I support you in your trusting

""Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me""
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet


And at once, I knew I was not magnificent


Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles


3rd and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me


And at once, I knew I was not magnificent


Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles


Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory


And at once, I knew I was not magnificent


High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Man they hungry
It's an appetite for destruction out here
The mob is equipped with full-armed artillery

I was born in Harlem where them things pop
At the block parties, niggas had to run
And they caught the motherfuckers on the same block
And they all at the war with the gun
R.I.P. Lil Na, Sharon, why they kill ya son?
Damn it, if I could've did it, I'mma hit 'em with the ton
Clit-a-dick, little-dick, feeling shit, hot in you lungs
Turn you bitch niggas to a couple nuns 
I came in the store and saw the whole thing
He said, I hope that you not one of them
Then I run around the corner, got the OG's
I told 'em, We got jumped by a couple punks
I swear to God, these niggas softer than the Brady Bunch
They gon' get it, man, this shit been goin' for a couple months
Then turn around the corner, seen a crowd looking stunned
With the all shaking on the floor, not saying nothin'


This just where we from
We all dyin' some day
At a picnic having fun
Probably dyin' by the gun
This just where we from
We prayin' every Sunday
When the killas gonna come
She about to lose her son, son


Let me D bop
Spanish nigga, everybody thought he black 
Used to wear a tank top with a fresh fade
OJ, kinda fat, 
Face stay greasy pollo all you eatin'
Thug nigga with the Cuban on the neck
Always carried a tech, Dominicano
Trappin' the bando, Orlando, he was Diablo in the flesh
Dimelo got into a little mess with D Bach
And he shot up the block with the Desert
'Bout to leave him messy but the bullets hit the belly
You could call me Hollywood, not ""the hood Tyler Perry""
Niggas making movies, more niggas getting buried
Niggas died, Desert, but this shit ain't really necessary
Caught up in the life, he got rich and got blurry
He took his own life and the one that he married, Ferg

Resist the temptation
This song go out to the Underground Railroad..

Resist the temptation of the beast
You slip and loose your grip, and forever fall asleep
The venom is contagious, be wary of its spell
What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell
I wonder if she knows, the devil's taking off her clothes
Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control
Poppa's doing worse, a victim of his deadly curse
Wouldn't be the first, to leave the ghetto in a hearse
Oh and how it hurts, the children pay the biggest price
Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life
Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
Someone from the top, supplying us with plenty crack
Keep 'em in a daze, don't let them see the other way
Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day
See, they never got a breath of the sunshine
Now the kid's addicted and only hit it one time
We're destined to be dead as a nation
Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation


From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation


Gamble for your soul with the devil
You wonder how low, can you go, before you finally reach the lowest level
As everybody sit and stares
There's no use looking in your eyes cause there isn't anybody there
And though it may make you wanna cry
Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why
I guess you think they'll understand
You feel cold, cause you sold your soul to the dopeman
Oh now there's no turning back, in fact
It's decided, that would live and die for the crack
You got no friends cause you cheated 'em all
Feel lonely, low, defeated and small
No one was there when I took the wrong path
And nobody'd care if I died in a blood bath
But is this my destiny?
Tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me
Cause I'm ready to end it all
One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all
I didn't mean to be a bother
A failure as a son, a husband and a father
I wish I could turn back the time
Go back and find, why I let it crack my mind
And my only explanation, it came to this
Resist the temptation


From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation


Your death left family behind
Your wife and your son find a gun, and pieces of daddy's mind
On the door and on the floor
Now her husband is dead, what else is she living for?
So now she picks up the gun
Now son is the only one
Grows up in adoption homes
Gets older, bolder, and cold cause he's left alone
To him, nothing is funny
Mind set on one thing, making his money
Since I was left with no hope
I want money and gold ropes and so I slang dope
Now I'm the neighborhood dopeman
And as long cause they smoking I'll never be broke man
I live the life of a trifle
Following a cycle, so I'm just a psycho
But if I had a better life
I would have lived a good life and did more things right
Hard to resist temptation
With all the aggravation and the frustration
Of living in the ghetto
Your mind gets twisted, just like a pretzel
So it's time that I check out
But one nosy cop, just won't let me get out
They got me trapped once again
With a choice: shoot the cop, or live life in the pen
I can't stand the frustration
Resist the temptation


From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation

And heartache number two was when you came back again
Oh, you came back, but never meant to stay

"I feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near

Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you?
Is it the clashing of clouds that hold fear?
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again

And as I wait and I look for an answer
To all the things going round in my head
I ask myself, could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again?

As the ominous light draws near
There's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here

Only God will know

You're sitting alone, you watch
As the wind's blowing treetops
And the swaying rusting of leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall


Only God knows
The whole sky glows


Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice

"Oh, I wish I had someone to love me
Someone to call me their own
Oh, I wish I had someone to live with
'Cause I'm tired of living alone

Oh, meet me tonight in the moonlight
Please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told

I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor darling alone
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone

Now I have a grand ship on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
Oh, that ship would be anchored and sold

Now, if I had the wings of an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my darling
And there I'd be willing to die

I'm moving to Tokyo
'Cause I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out


On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echoes can reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The East river when you are in love
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind




Fill all of the navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stay
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath the snowy veil


Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale

I've had to think up a way to survive
Since you said it's over
Told me good-bye
I just can't make it one day without you
Unless I pretend that the opposite's true


Rivers flow backwards
Valleys are high
Mountains are level
Truth is alive
I'm perfectly fine
And I don't miss you
The sky is green
And the grass is blue


How much can a heart and a troubled mind take
Where is that fine line before it all breaks
Can one end their sorrow
Just cross over it
And into that realm of insensitive bliss


There's snow in the tropics
There's ice on the sun
It's hot in the Arctic
And crying is fun
And I'm happy now
And I'm glad we're through

I got the guap on the mattress 
What, what, what
Came a long way from the mattress
Came a long way from the mattress
Came a long way from the mattress
Came a long way from the mattress


Came a long way from the mattress 
Boy, I used to jump on the mattress 
And I used to hump on the mattress 
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress 
My uncle kept O's in the mattress 
Flippin' the work like gymnastics 
Pitchin' the crack, it do backflips 
Po-po was flipping the mattress

It's me, it's me, you've come to take
My duality awakes
By midnight time I could not see
If I were you or you were me
We played the game with skillful hands
And so I asked for your demands
""Give me your love, give me your gun""
And he traced us back to where we'd begun


And so the morning came
And swept the night away
As I was looking for a way to disappear
Amongst the quiet things
And all these empty streets
I found a way, I found a way to reappear


I'll follow you where you go
Yes, I'll be there, just so you know
I need your condolence and your trust
But I won't ask, won't ask for much


There's a heavy load upon our backs
Of things we carry from the past
My guilt-filled mind, it tried to run
But you traced us back to where we'd begun


So the morning came
And swept the night away
As I was looking for a way to disappear
Amongst the quiet things
And all these empty streets
I found a way, I found a way to reappear


I'll follow you where you go
Yes, I'll be there, just so you know
I need your condolence and your trust
But I won't ask, won't ask for much
I'll only ask for so much
No, I won't ask, won't ask for much


And so the morning came
Swept the night away
I found a way, I found a way
To reappear

All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay I don't feel safe, I don't feel safe


Left broken, empty and in despair
Wanna breathe, can't find air
Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
So much more I have to say
Help me find a way


And I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone


I tell you, all my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe
I need to pray


Why do you play me like a game?
Always someone else to blame
Careless, helpless little man
Someday I might understand
There's not much more to say
But I hope you find a way


Still, I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone


I tell you, all my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not OK, I don't feel safe
I need to pray


Heavenly father
Please, heavenly father 
Oh, save me


And I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone
I said, I said, I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone

Whose round is it?
Down that beer quick, smash my glass back down
Fall over the table, all rowdy and pissed
Seems the only difference between mid-week shit
And weekend is how loud I speak
And whether I try and pull a girlfriend
That's it, who's got dough?
Hey, you know I'd pay but I'm broke, only got coinage to show
Putting off walking home on my own to my throne
Two empty takeaways, ashtrays, the remains of the day stoned
Pick a bottle off the table, peel the label, tell a fable
Offer opinion for free and a solution to the latest big news story
""Football and Smut Daily"" as I ponder winning the lottery
Buy a drink, chat to a lady, the girl's well fit
Definitely, not maybe, she's rude
I'd shag her and matey, right there

Gotta see a man about a dog, can't be late, I'm always late
Raining cats and fog but nice and dry in the Black Dog
Down it in one, my son
Can't sit here, gotta run, things need done
If they don't win this and the next one
They're getting relegated to the third division
At street level, real people, same repeated sequel
Rock and roll, four to the floor
Like last night, yesterday morning
And the night before, and the night before


Apparently there's a whole world out there somewhere

I just don't see it 
I just don't see it

Non ci speravo piu ormai
Ieri sera quando sei salita su da me
E sulla porta mi hai baciato
Il mio cuore si e fermato
E intanto che morivo
Pensavo ai giorni perduti
Vissuti senza di noi

Nei giorni che tu non c'eri
Vivevo con un'altra
Era stupenda
Come sei tu
Lei giocava con i suoi modi
Per attirarmi
E io l'amavo
Sempre di piu

Ma poi si sa
Succede che
Troppo sicuri si e di se;
Ed era compito di lei
Farsi piacere da me ma dopo un po'
Lei comincio
A trascurare quel suo far
Che mi faceva innamorar
Come facesti tu con me

Non ti ricordi quando noi
Coglievamo un po' d'insalata e tu
Con la gonna blu
Ti abbassavi apposta...
Davanti a me
Tu lo facevi
Volevi che io ti guardassi
E io ti guardavo li sull'insalata
Poi ci amavamo

Ma poi la favola fini
E l'insalata ingialli
La gonna blu
Tu non ti mettevi piu
Preferivi imprigionare

In una tuta
Militare. ma ora che sei qui
Con la gonna blu;
Non lasciarmi piu, Non toglierti la gonna...
Non togliertela piu...

We ain't unashamed just because we rap about it, nah
We unashamed ‘cause we live it
I'm throwing out the real so they probably catching feelings
Give it away, give it away now, now nah that ain't it

They ain't even know we was out here 
They gonna find out what we 'bout here

Show me something real
That's just how I feel
Don't you lie lie lie
Show me something real


Look, undercover love is hard to be the one who knows
To play the sidenigga knowing you can't let it show
Cause it was fun and games until I started thinking 'bout it
Bitch you not gon' play me if I want you, he don't keep you happy
I'm not the type to go and really care but damn I miss it when you used to run your fingers through my hair
And pictures being sent to each other just to have em all
Drunk nights made you happy, me and you always had a ball
After sober blunts 'bout what we did the night before
Silly convos through the text we never called each other's phone
Cause I knew my place and now it starts to get to me
Cause knowing I can't have you when I snap back to reality
This shit is getting crazy cause I never thought we'd get attached
Arguments we always had cause you always made me mad
But now I see that all I did was set myself up for the trap
Cause you know you better off with him
But you know that's not gonna last


Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth


Knowing every move I make and how I am with someone else
Anything I've asked of you ain't always end up being done
But when that nigga asks you for something man you always jump
I don't wanna be a side nigga cause I fell in love
How you think I feel when I can't talk about you to my dawg
It wasn't 'posed to be like this but I seen it coming
Shit was getting hectic and you quick to start running from it
Cause you care about yourself, fuck whatever happens to me
I was fucking stupid, making you what really mattered to me
They don't need to know the details cause you know you wrong
And you know you the only reason why I wrote this song
Show me something real, show me something real
Have respect when I'm around, you know how to hold it down
I don't wanna see you with no hickeys on your fucking neck
And always keep that nigga in a box and make sure it's checked


Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth

Why can't it be like it used to be
Stop the rain, stop the rain
Rainin' in my heart

Seems like it was only yesterday
We're so in love, so in love just pays
I've keep looking at the sun
Somehow it keeps rainin' in my heart
Keep rainin', keep rainin', keep rainin'

Even though what's said or done
My love for you is an eternal one
But how can I say bye with a love so deep
I keep praying and it keeps rainin'

Somebody stop the rain
Yeah, now somebody stop the rain, rain, yeah
Somebody to see me
Somebody stop the rain, oh yeah

'Cause it seems like, seems like
Seems like it's gonna keep rainin'
It keeps on rainin', it keeps on rainin'
Keeps on rainin'
Keeps on rainin', keeps on rainin'

And how can I say bye

They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell


They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand


And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings


Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please


As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything


There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?


Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?


Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

The tale I see it tells my favorite story
Of friction and glory

"WHAT IS A JAZZ COMPOSER?

Each jazz musician when he takes a horn in his hand- trumpet, bass, saxophone, drums-whatever instrument he plays-each soloist, that is, when he begins to ad lib on a given composition with a title and improvise a new creative melody, this man is taking the place of a composer. He is saying, “listen, I am going to give you a new complete idea with a new set of chord changes. I am going to give you a new melodic conception on a tune you are familiar with. I am a composer.” That’s what he is saying

I have noticed that there are many kinds of composers in this so-called jazz. For instance, there are musicians who simply take rhythmic patterns and very spare notes-very limited invention melodically-and play in a soulful swinging way. Some people in the audience, when asked what they think about jazz, say, “I just go by the feeling, I go by the feeling the guy gives me.” Now, whether there is feeling or not depends upon what your environment or your association is or whatever you may have in common with the player. If you feel empathy for his personal outlook, you naturally feel him musically more than some other environ-mental and musical opposite who is, in a way. beyond you

I, myself, came to enjoy the players who didn’t only just swing but who invented new rhythmic patterns, along with new melodic concepts. And those people are: Art Tatum, Bud Powell, Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, Lester Young, Dizzy Gillespie and Charles Parker, who is the greatest genius of all to me because he changed the whole era around. But there is no need to compare composers. If you like Beethoven, Bach or Brahms, that’s okay. They were all pencil composers. I always wanted to be a spontaneous composer. I thought I was, although no one’s mentioned that. I mean critics or musicians. Now, what I’m getting at is that I know I’m a composer. I marvel at composition, at people who are able to take diatonic scales, chromatics, 12-tone scales, or even quarter-tone scales. I admire anyone who can come up with something original. But not originality alone, because there can be originality in stupidity, with no musical description of any emotion or any beauty the man has seen, or any kind of life he has lived. For instance, a man says he played with feeling. Now he can play with feeling and have no melodic concept at all. That’s often what happens in jazz: I have found very little value left after the average guy takes his first eight bars-not to mention two or three choruses, because then it just becomes repetition, riffs and patterns, instead of spontaneous creativity, I could never get Bird to play over two choruses. Now, kids play fifty thousand if you let them. Who is that good?

Today, things are at the other extreme. Everything is supposed to be invented, the guys never repeat anything at all and probably couldn’t. They don’t even write down their own tunes, they just make them up as they sit on the bandstand. It’s all right, I don’t question it. I know and hear what they are doing. But the validity remains to be seen -what comes, what is left, after you hear the melody and after you hear the solo. Unless you just want to hear the feeling, as they say

When I was a kid and Coleman Hawkins played a solo or Illinois Jacquet created “Flyin’ Home,” they  memorized their solos and played them back for the audience, because the audience had heard them on records. Today I question whether most musicians can even repeat their solos alter they’ve played them once on record. In classical music, for example people go to hear Janos Starker play Kodaly. They don’t go to hear him improvise a Kodaly, they go to hear how he played it on record and how it was written. Jazz was at one time the same way. You played your ad lib solo, you created it, and if it was worthwhile, then you played it in front of the public again

Now, on this record there is a tune which is an improvised solo and which I am very proud of. I am proud because to me it has the expression of what I feel, and it shows changes in tempo and changes in mode, yet the variations on the theme still fit into one composition. . I would say the composition is on the whole as structured as a written piece of music. For the six or seven minutes it was played , the solo was within the category of one feeling, or rather, several feelings expressed as one. I’m not sure whether every musician who improvises can do this. I think I do it better on bass, although most people in the past did not understand the range I used to play , because they didn’t really listen, they thought I was just playing high to play high, rather than realizing that my composition began some place and developed to another. I have never struggled to be accepted as a great bassist-I imagine I could have been if I had seen my available musical goal there. If people really knew the qualification of a good bass player, they would flip-because I know thirty or forty bass players who have the technique that I have.* Whether or not they are as inventive is something else because when you study the instrument, it calls for a technique that jazz has not even begun to express yet, with the bow or with pizzicato. The full-developed bass player masters harmonics with a sense-I don’t mean just scraping the bow across and making squeak sounds, I mean he can play compositions in harmonics. There are a million bowings that could and probably do duplicate a horn better. For instance, my dream has been to put basses, or maybe two basses in a reed section, in place of the baritone saxophone. I never had the chance so I could never say how it really sounds, it is only in my mind that I can say I hear it and it would work better than most baritone saxes. I had a classical student who was in the symphony in Minneapolis. He used to study through the mail and, for his lessons, I would write things for him and he would re-tape them and send them back. That was when I realized how much more could done, musically, by using the boss with the bow, by utilizing all the possibilities of this instrument. Back to the record: the music on this record is involved with my trying to say what the hell I am here for. And similar ideas. Another one is: let my children hear music -for God’s sake-they have had enough noise. But mainly I am saying: Do you really know Mingus, you critics? Here is a piece I wrote in 1939 and I wrote it like this because thought in 1939 I would probably get it recorded some day. But when you have to wait thirty years to get one piece played-what do you think happens to a composer who is sincere and loves to write and has to wait thirty years to have someone play a piece of his music? That was when I was energetic and wrote all the time. Music was my life. Had I been born in a different country or had I been born white, I am sure I would have expressed my ideas long ago. Maybe they wouldn’t have been as good because when people are born free-I can’t imagine it, but I’ve got a feeling that if it’s so easy for you, the struggle and the initiative are not as strong as they are for a person who has to struggle and therefore has more to say

Part of the reason I am a composer is that I studied composition with Lloyd Reese. Lloyd Reese taught Eric Dolphy; Harry Carney also studied with him and so did Ben Webster and Buddy Collette, to name a few. Art Tatum highly recommended him. When Art found out I was studying with Lloyd, he asked me to come and play for him. Lloyd Reese was a master musician, he knew jazz and all the fundamentals of music from the beginning.  And he could play anything. I remember he turned a record on to me one time.  In any case I remember one day when I came to Lloyd’s house, he said: “What is this?” and he played a record, I didn’t know the title at the time, but he said: “What do you think is going on in this particular movement right there?” And I said: “I don’t know, man, but there’s a whole lotta shit going on. There’s too much to figure out.” The timpani was playing and the basses were playing and the piano was playing a percussional sound with the bass- you could hardly hear the piano-and the flutes were playing syncopated chop rhythms, the trumpets were playing cock valves, and this cat said: “Well, here it is,” and he took a C-Seventh chord-I remember it started on the Third, and he played E, G, B flat, and D natural, and he said: “This is what the clarinets are doing . . .” and he began to decipher down what was going on. He said: “Here’s the French horn part” and it came in on G, B flat, D, F an octave down and ended A natural, which clashed against the B flat the clarinets were playing in the E, G, B flat, D natural line, and it made a beautiful sound. I said: “Whaaa? What is that?”

So I’m saying briefly that people don’t know what a black man -people don’t know what it took to make a jazz musician. In my young days, we were raised more on classical music than on any other kind. It was the only music we were exposed to, other than the church choir. I wasn’t raised in a night club. I wasn’t raised in a whore house . Today, I don’t know how they train kids musically. But my point about Reese is that if you told the average person Lloyd Reese took the music of Stravinsky off a record, he would say you were crazy. There are millions of musicians, however, who have the capability of hearing and reproducing what they hear. It wasn’t called ear training; I don’t know what he called it, He would just say: ”Now you take the trumpet part. Now, what’s the French horn doing?” It was to show you structure, I imagine

As I was saying, each jazz musician is supposed to be a composer. Whether he is or not, I don’t know. I don’t listen to that many people. If I did, I probably wouldn’t play half as much to satisfy myself. As a youth I read a book by Debussy and he said that as soon as he finished a composi- tion he had to forget it because it got in the way of his doing anything else new and different. And I believed him. I used to work with Tatum, and Tatum knew every tune written, including the classics, and I think it got in the way of his composition, because he wasn’t a Bud Powell. He wasn’t as melodically inventive as Bud. He was technically flashy and he knew so much music and so much theory that he couldn’t come up with anything wrong; it was just exercising his theory. But as far as making that original melodic concept, as Bird and Bud did, Art didn’t do this for me in a linear sense. I would say he did it more in a chordal-structure sense. Bud and Bird to me should go down as composers, even though they worked within a structured context using other people’s compositions. For instance, they did things like “All The Things You Are” and “What Is This Thing Called love.” Their solos are new classical compositions within the structured form they used. It is too bad for us that they didn’t compose the whole piece instead of using other people’s tunes to work within. If they had, they would have been put in the same class as Bartok and Debussy-to anyone who knows. Bud wrote a few things and so did Bird. But they were still within the simple chord changes you were used to-either the blues . In other words, if they had created anything complex, I am sure they could have upset the world

For instance, Bird called me on the phone one day and said: “How does this sound?” and he was playing- ad-libbing-to the Berceuse, or lullaby, section of Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite! I imagine he had been doing it all through the record, but he just happened to call me at that time and that was the section he was playing his ad lib solo on, and it sounded beautiful. It gave me an idea about what is wrong with present-day symphonies: they don’t have anything going on that captures what the symphony is itself, after written. I’d like to write a symphony, myself, on this form-the old western form of classical music-I’d like to write a suite of three or four hours and have a solo in spots that is like Charlie Parker, with Bird in mind, playing ad lib

I think the music on this record is serious in every sense. I say, let my children have music. I said it earlier. For God’s sake, rid this society of some of the noise so that those who have ears will be able to use them some place listening to good music. When I say good I don’t mean that today’s music is bad because it is loud. I mean the structures have paid no attention to the past history of music. Nothing is simple. It’s as if people came to Manhattan and acted like it was still full of trees and grass and Indians instead of concrete and tall buildings. It’s like a tailor cutting clothes without knowing the design, It’s like living in a vacuum and not paying attention to anything that came before you. What’s worse is that critics take a guy who only plays in the key of C and call him a genius, when they should say those guys are a bitch in C-natural. Pop music is still another story. Even tune structures are stolen. The music I’ve heard from the late pop groups  seems to stem from a mixture of many different American composers and American music. ” I Found A New Baby.” “Nature Boy.” “Ain’t Necessarily So.” I hear these tunes, certain tunes, all through The Beatles’ music, for instance. I don’t know if they just surround themselves with this kind of music and compose from it. But it doesn’t come out ringing true to me as English composition. For instance, Schillinger used to say that you could take a sheet of music, turn it upside down-alter you wrote a cer- tain movement-eight or ten bars-copy it upside down, then copy it backwards, from the end of the page back, turn the page over and copy it backwards and upside down. This would give you eighty bars or more of the same mood without working for it. It’s the same as taking a tape recorder melody and splicing it up several thousand different ways. To me that’s not spiritual music. It leaves the feeling and emotion out. It seems to me that it should come from the heart, even though it’s composed

I think it is evident when a person is stealing or copying a form of music which is not his own. Other musicians recognize it, but I don’t think it is important enough to them to say anything about it. Why, at least, doesn’t the public, or don’t the critics point it out? I heard a lot of Bird’s solos in the music of this past and present rock music era. The names are not important. But what they do, more or less, is just take a melody created by a jazz soloist and put words to it. They add words to a solo with a few of the notes left out. That is what it sounds like to me and others I’ve discussed it with

As I say, let my children have music. Jazz-the way it has been handled in the past-stifles them so that they believe only in the trumpet, trombone, saxophone, maybe a flute now and then or a clarinet . But it is not enough. I think it is time our children were raised to think they can play bassoon, oboe, English horn, French horn, lull percussion, violin, cello. The results would be-well the Philharmonic would not be the only answer for us then. If we so-called jazz musicians who are the composers, the spontaneous composers, started including these instruments in our music, it would open everything up, it would get rid of prejudice because the musicianship would be so high in caliber that the symphony couldn’t refuse us

In fact, who wants to be in the symphony anyway, nowadays? If you stop and take note of what jazz has done, and the kind of musicianship which has developed from each instrument , it becomes obvious that it has made each player a virtuoso. That is probably why most European musicians now choose to be jazz musicians rather than classical players because they are always proving that the instrument can do more than is possible. I mean, the range has doubled in octaves. For instance, Stravinsky wrote a piece for a high trumpet. He used a special trumpet-a piccolo trumpet-to play high, but Cat Anderson played off the piano with an ordinary trumpet-played higher than the piano goes, higher than piccolos. So do Maynard Ferguson, Snooky Young, Ernie Royal, Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, Freddie Webster, Dizzy Gillespie, Fats Novarro, Clifford Brown. Hobart Dotson, Kenny Durham

There are many other instruments besides the trumpet which jazz musicians have made do the impossible. And they can play, for hours on end, technical, involved, difficult, educated lines that have melodic sense. They are all virtuosi. The same goes for string bass. The same goes for saxophone, although it is not used much in symphony. But anything Milhaud has done in classical music, McPherson and Bird, alone, do with ease as well as human warmth and beauty. Tommy Dorsey, for example, raised the range of the trombone two octaves. Britt Woodman raised it three. And take Jimmy Knepper. One of his solos was taken off a record of mine and written out for classical trombone in my ballet. The trombone player could barely play it. He said it was one of the most technical exercises he had ever attempted to play. And he was just playing the notes-not the embellishments or the sound that Jimmy was getting

That about covers it

Let my children have music! Let them hear live music. Not noise. My children! You do what you want with your own!

You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
But you won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless


It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'


And I'm speechless

Fuck you, bitch, I'm here all by myself
I tried the belt, but couldn't get it tight enough
So I smoke the blunt, my lungs are rust
My brain is dust from all of these drugs
I can't think straight, I'll walk the plank
Spill my blood so sharks will come and eat me 
—Whole!
In between Hell and Earth, I do the limbo
My body alive, but my mind is dead
Going through the motions, all of them emotions
Dump me in the ocean, I'm drowning again
We don't have to pretend


Okay, here we go, blade to my throat
Whole floor soaked with blood from a goat
Bag full of dope, room full of smoke
All black coat with a wolf for a cloak
Do you feel my essence? Depressing presence
My main goal in death is to blow up heaven
Don't get the message, can't teach the lesson
Just a feeling that you get when you hang with peasants
Ridin' down Crescent, my weapon is oh-so-sharp and ready
Ward of the 7th, the legend is that you won't see twenty
Me and Lil Uzi full of cruelty, just a product of the times
The fucking highly almighty, the G, the 5, the 9

Confined by the things we own

Right in the face of the damage done

Like gloves around a hand
Our arms are wrapped around each others shoulders
And then we're on fire with parity
With standards of golden
With birds that are of feathers of predictability
And while I am flying high
You fly beside
Just when I start to drop my guard, then


Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde
I get used to your light, then the jarring blindside
Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde
When I drop my guard, you bring out the dark side
I am done with your Jekyll and Hyde


I thought there was a protocol
On how you treat a friend
Your hot and cold, I'd share my soul
But you're not listening
So I'm not stressing it
No pressure on my mind at all
Just curious about your split personality
Allegory double life
One moment's really nice
Next moment, exploding on me like it was dynamite
With no responsibility to be accountable
I guess I'm gone free away now from your hold
When you're kind, your kind is transcendent
Harmony rules the land
But sure as night turns to day, it is always uncertain
Just when I'm lulled by your sweet side
The harder the fall when you flip the script each time

Underneath the clouds in the air
Rose the Trylon and the Perisphere

And that for me was the finest of scenes
The perfect world across the river in Queens

Fifty years after the fair
I drink from a different cup
But it does no good to compare
Cause nothing ever measures up

I guess just for a second we thought
That all good things would rise to the top

And how beautiful it was, tomorrow
We'll never have a day of sorrow
We got through the '30s but our belts were tight
We conceived of a future with no hope in sight
We've got decades ahead of us to get it right, I swear
Fifty years after the fair

Fifty years after the fair
I live in tomorrow town
Even on a wing and a prayer
The future never came around
It hurts to even think of those days
The damage we do by the hopes that we raise

But how beautiful it was, tomorrow
We'll never have a day of sorrow
We got through the '30's but our belts were tight
We conceived of a future with no hope in sight
We've got decades ahead of us to get it right, I swear
Fifty years after the fair

Is she ready to know my frustration?
What she slipping inside, slow castration
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me
Did she come here to try, try to take me


Did she call my name?
I think it's going to rain
Oh, when I die


Was it something I said, held against me?
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing
I can help her but won't, now she hates me


Did she call my name?
I think it's going to rain
Oh, when I die


She won't let me hide
She don't want me to cry


Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me
Could she love me again, or will she hate me
Probably not, I know why, can't explain me


Did she call my name?
I think it's going to rain
Oh, when I die

I woke up today in London
As the plane was touching down
And all I could think about was Monday
Maybe I'd be back around
If this keeps me away much longer
I don't know what I would do
You've got to understand it's a hard life
That I'm going through


And when the night falls in around me
I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
'Cause all I think about is you


Well, L.A. is getting kind of crazy
And New York is getting kind of cold
I keep my head from getting lazy
I just can't wait to get back home


And all these days I spend away
I'll make up for this, I swear
I need your love to hold me up
When it's all too much to bear


And when the night falls in around me
I don't think I'll make it through

So much on my mind, I think I think too much
Read between these lines, unspoken weight of words
But time comes to rest when you are by my side, it blurs


And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone


Change in every wind
The sands of time don't know our name
Oh nothing's sure, but surely as we stand
I promise I will stay the same
And I've never seen forever
But I know we'll remain


And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

While my world's unraveling
Say you'll never change, ooooohhhh!!! Oh!

The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening, 1945
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come


But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on


And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart


But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on


And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born
Indentions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces filled with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes

I can tell by your eyes
Ooh you look so surprised
'Cause you remember me when
I was at the top of my game
Well, let me explain

There were a light once that shone on me
Confident, I believed, I was all I could be
No time for hard times
I was happy, I was free
Life was so, oh so good, when I was your baby

I'd laugh at myself, these feelings aren't new
Just a byproduct of the life I once knew
Yes, my career is great
I should be satisfied, I guess
Ah, but let me tell you when I was at my best

"Finally all the World will see
Rise again before the endless silence
Burn the soul before we'll all be free
Light the path beneath the blackened burning sky

One final sacrifice this night belongs to me
Turn back before the dawn of winter
So far away the cry set fallen angels free
Through my mind tonight our journey ever after
Never-ending solitude, this is your life to be
So cold and dark the voice of sadness
Suffering in endless pain, the truth of all to be
Growing back to life through ever-blinding darkness

Free falling, fate's warning, find a life to hold on
Soul stealers, true believers, rise now they are gone!

And as they ride away, forsake the one to save us
Winter's mourning on a lost, fallen world
Pray now united, in a lifetime alone
Won't you wait for the silence so strong?
Wait for the dawn!

Tonight!
Falling like the rain, insanity lives on
Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying
Raging endlessly they come
And the morning light will hide the darkener days gone by
And the Sun will shine again across the blazing skies
Glorious eternally, we'll rise above the World
Marching on till victory we fight!
The Fire still burns!

Looking back our passing lives, their memories to see
Flick through the passages of silence
Hidden by the sacrifice, to set the Demons free
Now they understand: reclaim the land relentless

Fear calling, transforming, stand alone in our time
Advocation, desolation, slay the vision divine

And all the stars fall around the World tonight
Silent forces from a past life return
Pray for the silence in a world so alone
Till we touch the horizon beyond!
Fly through the storm!

Tonight!
Falling like the rain, insanity lives on
Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying
Raging endlessly they come
And the morning light will hide the darkener days gone by
And the Sun will shine again across the blazing skies
Glorious eternally, we'll rise above the World
Marching unto victory we fight!
The Fire still burns!

The tears in your eyes, a lifetime of misery
In the silence we stand all alone for the fate of our own destiny
A lifetime of lies, one chance at this fantasy
The judgment will pass for the cries of the World that has faded for me

Tonight!
Falling like the rain, insanity lives on
Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying
Raging endlessly they come
And the morning light will hide the darkener days gone by
And the Sun will shine again across the blazing skies
Glorious eternally, we'll rise above the World
Marching unto victory we fight!
The Fire still burns!

"Wings of an angel
Replaced by beautiful scars
Well hidden in the dark
Time seems to stand still
The world is falling apart
So heavy on my heart
And it's raining
And it all comes crashing down
Anyone would give up
But not me not now

Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
I can do anything
I found a strength I never knew I had in me
With these broken wings

Turning the pages
Cuts like a knife once again
Where does the end begins?
Through all the stages
A silent fighter remains
You got to lose to win
Through the fire
And the smoke starts to clear
Anyone would give up
But not now not here

Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
I can do anything
I found a strength I never knew I had in me

Wrapped my hands around you
Changed my everything

You, you who has smiled when you're in pain
You who has soldiered through the profane
They were distracted and shut down
So why, why would you talk to me at all?
Such words were dishonorable and in vain
Their promise as solid as the fog


And where was your watchman then?


I'll be your keeper for life as your guardian
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand
The greatest honor of all, as your guardian

You who was pushed beyond what's humane

No more managing unmanageables
No more holding still in the hailstorm

Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane, got no time, don't need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter, she's all I need
She got her father, as I grow
Hell yeah, I did it, I'm on a roll
Thought I'd be up with my nigga, no
I'm just gettin' warmed up, let's start the show
I'm schoolin' these niggas, so in the zone and I'm rigged to blow

And I'm flossin' and bossin' these silly hoes
Learned the codes, serve up the magic for all of those

Grab on and hold on, won't steer you wrong

Just bring him through the front door, that's the easy thing to do

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh what a joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes
To see a hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me too

Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh what a joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes
To see a hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus, I want a hippopotamus
I want it, I want it, I really really really want
A hippopotamus

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a dog, no dinky Tinker Toy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me too

Same old story
Everyday
Hateful words

So much anger
So much pain


I don't know
If you believe in Heaven
I don't know
If you believe in Hell
But I bet we can agree that the devil
Is alive and well
Alive and well


The darkest prison
To the largest Church
Sometimes for fortune
Sometimes for fame
It's ironic
That some of the worst things
Are done in God's name


I don't know

If you believe in Hell
But I bet we can agree that the devil
Is alive and well
Alive and well


They can debate what's real, what's right, what's true
What's sent from up above
All I know is I'd be leery of anything that isn't based in love
'Cause God is love

This is a black market reformation
Keep your lips closed
And don't you ever give away our underground location
This is a black tie affair
Don't ever close your mouth
And we'll stay here until someone falls in their own snare
I had this planned all along, and I brought you here for this
So tie your mask on and pretend that nothing's wrong


And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can
And I'll try to stay here, here with you


This is a black market reformation
How does it feel to be under the gun?
Last ones to laugh pull the trigger here on the run
You can hide the money, I'll mark an X
I'm above the law and you're the order
You make everything make sense


And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can
And I'll try to stay here with you


And I know Mexico is south of here
Beautiful this time of year
So let's jump the border when the coast is clear
Salvation waits at ocean shore
We won't have to lie no more
Don't you worry baby I'll be right here

Poison Oak, some boyhood bravery
When our telephone was a tin can on a string
And I fell asleep with you still talking to me
You said you weren't afraid to die

In polaroids, you were dressed in women's clothes
Were you made ashamed, why'd you lock them in a drawer?
Well, I don't think I've ever loved you more ...


Than when you turned away
When you slammed the door
When you stole the car
And drove towards Mexico

And you wrote bad checks
Just to fill your arm
I was young enough
I still believed in war


Well let the poets cry
Themselves to sleep
And all their tearful words
Would turn back into steam

But me I'm a single cell
On a serpent's tongue
There is muddy field
Where a garden was
And I'm glad you got away
But I'm still stuck out here
My clothes are soaking wet
From your brother's tears


And I, Never thought
This life was possible
You're the, Yellow bird
I've been waiting for

The end of Paralysis
I was a statuette
Now I'm drunk as hell
On a piano bench
And when I press the keys
It all gets reversed
The sound of loneliness
Makes me happier

I was looking for greener pastures
When I left my old Kentucky home
I was chasing after dreams I thought I'd master
So I left the one that loved me all along
Thinking only of myself and doing better
Didn't care about the grief I left behind
Didn't even make a card or write a letter
So sure I'd be successful in no time
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope


Isn't it funny how you are when you're younger?
How what you have is never good enough
How the years will find you searching through your plunder
Looking for the treasures you gave up
Well the seasons came, they went
The dreams all shattered
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound


Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind
Where the bluegrass music's always playing
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin
I'm heading for bluer pastures

Major! Hell motherfuckin' yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Cooley, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellraiser


Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin' at sixteen
On the scene watchin' fiends buggin'
Kickin' up dust with the older G's
Soakin' up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot
I learned not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes
Taught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions
While other suckers was guessin', I was gangsta sexin'
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary and cuttin' classing
I'm buckin' blastin', straight mashin'
Mobbin through the overpass laughin'
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger on the trigger
'Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraiser, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin'
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark 'til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin' richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin' trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein' black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin' major, unhh

Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellraiser, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin' to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies rushin' into early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggas burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin' triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin' better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin' blunts
Gettin' drunk off that Tanqueray gin
'Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen'

She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl, killed Latasha
Now I'm screamin' fuck the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker, I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, thug nigga

He laid down his hammer and he cried, Lord, Lord

Got money roarin' in my head, Lord, Lord

We are the ones taking all the pain
Falling on our faces they don't care anyway
Anyway, now
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive
You're the one that pushes me all the time
All the time, now
We are hard at play
Always praised to do what they say
Calling me to rage
Feeling power, I must take its place some way


Never gonna run away seeking out my path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die I'm insane so dangerous
Don't you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins


We are the ones reaching out in vain
Trying to solve our problems they won't go away
Go away now
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive
You're the one that pushes me all the time
All the time, now
We are hard at play
Always praised to do what they say
Calling me deranged
Feeling power, I must take its place some way


Never gonna run away seeking out my path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die I'm insane so dangerous
Don't you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins


Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!

We on three nights and no sleep
Roll with those who know me
We chillin’ up so high
Yeah, you can find us in the nose bleeds
Fresh kicks and yes seats
A diamond on both feet
We living like we don’t care what tomorrow's gonna be
Everybody in this place is either blind or gonna see
That everything I need is right in front of me


So throw your phone away and let the night decide
’Cause when the sun goes down you’d better pick a side
’Cause baby, it's do or die
Baby, it's do or die
So throw your phone away and let the night decide
’Cause when the sun goes down...
Baby, it's do or die!


It seems like four nights, still awake
Shake so bad I need to take
One shot for my lady and twenty for those that got away
Don’t feel bad, I’m okay
Watch me Transform, Michael Bay
Standing on the table, shouting
""Warriors! Come out and Play!""


So throw your phone away and let the night decide
’Cause when the sun goes down you’d better pick a side
’Cause baby, it's do or die
Baby, it's do or die
So throw your phone away and let the night decide
’Cause when the sun goes down...
Baby, it's do or die!


I’m thinking that this beast is apart of me
’Cause I can’t seem to sleep for the death of me
So I throw away my phone and let the night decide
Then I can't ever settle down until the day I die
Oh no, we did it again
We stayed up all night, we ain’t sleepin' in
You don’t know where I have been
I got the devil hiding underneath my skin
Drink up, we need a medicine
If we wanna dive into the night, my friend
Everything comes to an end
So you know this time it's do or die again


Baby, it's do or die

Between a broken nose and a fake smile
Between piety and gunpowder
Between fighting and fleeing the scene
Between murder and diplomacy
Between aggression and oblivion
Between brutal and realistically well-behaved
Between screaming and pulling in the reins
Between tiptoeing and ambling


What am I to do with all this fire?

Would you stay with me in this red space?



Between violence and silently seething
Between my fist and my pollyanna flower
Between ""fuck you"" to your face and ""it's alright""
Between war and denial

Between bursting and boiling

Do I overwhelm you in this place?

Ain't got no patience, so let's go 
Look, I'm diet drama
Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas
Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes



Walk in the place, they know my face

Only one solo, I swore
Big mouth, applause

Wanna hear it before I say ""naw""

Escaped, and I risked my life

It's been seventeen days since you left
Twenty hours and thirty minutes
Count the seconds every breath
And watch the road roll out like ribbon
And maybe she just can't forget
All the miles they have driven
Since the moment that they met


He took her heart
Into his hands
Turned into ashes
Slipped through his fingers
It tore him apart
And he couldn't stand
Watching the magic
Turn into cinders


So when you pull away
Don't let the memories blind you
All of the things you chase
Falling away behind you
Is something you can't replace
Chained to the love that bonds you
Don't let the past remind you
She's the last of her kind
The last of her kind
The last of her kind


It's been twenty-three days since they spoke
And he almost sent a postcard
In every sentence that he wrote
Etched like tombstones on a grave yard
And maybe he just can't accept
All the strings that needed changing
The mistakes that he was making


He took her heart 
Into his hands 
Turned into ashes
Slipped through his fingers
It tore him apart 
And he couldn't stand 
Watching the magic
Turn into cinders


So when you pull away
Don't let the memories blind you
All of the things you chase
Falling away behind you
Is something you can't replace
Chained to the love that bonds you
Don't let the past remind you

"I'm dancing on the White House lawn
Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn
Hanging round the gardens of Babylon

Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up
She gets more fan mail than the Pope 
She takes the Mickey out of all my phobias
Like signing checks to ward off double pneumonia

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze

I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa
Had an eyeful of the tower in France
I'm hanging round the gardens of Madison

And the seat of learning
And the flush of success
Relieves a constipated mind
I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner
A fitting menu for a dilettante

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze

Love is a fire of flaming brandy
Upon a crepe suzette
Let's get this romance cooking, honey
But let us not forget

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze

My dream girl don't exist
At the age of five she slit her wrist
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So her parents buried her in the ground
And this day I can still hear the sound
Of a life in outer space


My dream girl don't exist
Just you and I and this TV
And this illness seems to feel so strange
Like a henchman that's about to hang
The moon up like a ball and chain
And set the sands ablaze


And the weight is waiting on
Feel the world so real and strong


My dream girl don't exist
Took her photograph from a history book
I believe she had a voice and name
Three children on the coast of Maine
Her life was in a hurricane
Of love and real embrace


My dream girl don't exist
At the age of five she slit her wrist
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So one day she took a stroll to town
And walked in front of a Greyhound bound
For New York central state


And the weight is waiting on
And the weight is waiting on
Feel the world so real and strong
She goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid

Blew the past a kiss
Turned it upside down

Who disappeared before the Flood

Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven


Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day


Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the topest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same


We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

When the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide

Everybody taking different sides

When I first met you got a feeling that I'll never forget

We'd be bad together
But the make up sex is good as it gets
And I just want to say to you


Every time that I hate you
I love you 
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you 
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can't let you go
And I just want to get enough
Every time that I hate you
I love you 
You're the part of the pain that I love too 
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can see right through
You love to hate me too 


Every time we fight I feel like breaking up but I know I can't

I learned a lesson it's a losing battle
A war I can't win
And now I got to say to you


Every time that I hate you
I love you 
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you 
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can't let you go
And I just want to get enough
Every time that I hate you

You're the part of the pain that I love too 
It doesn't matter what you're saying

You love to hate me too 



You love to hate me too

And if we make it through
I just want to say to you


Every time that I hate you

You're more than I can take can't get enough of you

Well, the ragman draws circles, up and down the block
I'd ask him what's the matter, but I know that he don't talk
And the ladies treat me kindly, and they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart, I, I know I can't escape
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again


Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and bell
Speaking with some French girl, who says she knows me well
And me, I'd send a message, to find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen, and the mailbox is locked
But oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again


Now, Mona, she tried to warn me, stay away from the railroad line
She says all the railroad men
Drink up your blood like wine
And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that""
But then again there's only one I've met
He just smoked my eyelids, and he punched my cigarette
Whoa, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again


Grandpa died last week, and they buried him in the rocks
Everyone still talks about how badly they are shocked
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street, and he shot it full of holes
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again




Now the Senator, he came down here, showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted, and wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again


Now the preacher looks so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest
And he cursed me when I proved it to him
Then I said, ""You see, not even you can hide
You see, you're just like me, and I hope you're satisfied""
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again


Now the rainman gave me two cures, then he said jump right in
The first was Texas medicine, the second was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them, and it strangled up my mind
Now people just get uglier, and I've got no sense of time
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again


Now, when Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free, 'neath her Panamanian moon
And I said, ""Ah, come on now, you know about my debutante
And she says, ""Your debutante knows just what you need
But I know what you want""
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again


Now the bricks, they lay on Grand Street where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly, it all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently, waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all of these things twice
Oh, mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again
Oh, mama, can this really be the end

Headed out again, running all in vain
Motel blues, only bad news
I'm never looking for you
You find me all the same


I lay awake at night envisioning
A trace from the past
This heavy heart of mine, it never fails
To bring me right back


Now I see us walking down Cedar Lane
Slow in the sunshine, fast in the rain
Time moved, so swiftly all of those days
I still remember how you used to say
""Something good will come out of this""


Coast after coast, cities and states
My world's an empty map and nothing remains
The place we belonged has quietly gone
While we were making plans, it drifted away

Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heart-broke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went

And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a nigga living phat

Just hold my hand and we'll go skyscraping

If your mama asks you, say we're just escaping
We're gonna be sky high

Time flies, but I don't know where it's going
You vanish in the haze
Sometimes I wish that life could be everlasting

Where mute memories start talking
The boss that couldn't help but hurt you
And the pretty thing he made desert you
I'm going out like a baby
A naive, unsatisfiable baby
Grabbing onto whatever's around
For the soaring high or the crushing down
With hidden cracks that don't show
But that constantly just grow


I'm looking for the man that attacked me
While everybody was laughing at me
You beat it in me, that part of you
But I'm gonna split us back in two
Tired of living in a cloud
If you're gonna say shit now, you'll do it out loud


It's 2:45 in the morning
And I'm putting myself on warning
For waking up in an unknown place
With a recollection you've half erased
Looking for somebody's arms
To wave away past harms

The both of you can just fade to black

Been pushed away and I'll never go back

And the colors have all turned grey
When the desert that you're in gets too cold for you to stay
When it's hard to tell the night from the day

When your hands have lost the love for the trade
And the reasons for work just ain't the same
When you put down the money is the blood worth all the pain
When you can't see the sunshine for the rain

Livin' ain't a promise
Livin' ain't a right
And no one here is getting out alive
So pick up all your pieces
Cast the doubt away
Rediscover the color in the grey
Rediscover all the color in the grey

Ramble, when this world gives you more than you can handle
You get on those two wheels and you fly to outer space
Like you're in a one man race
Never thinking 'bout tomorrow, you beg, steal, you borrow
And gamble, you gamble with your love like you don't need it
And when it's said and done you'll be alone out on the road
Shaking off the cold
No one to keep you warm, I guess you were born to ramble


Freedom, you say all you ever wanted was your freedom
But is it worth the cost of never calling one place home?
Always going, going, gone
Nowhere to rest your bones, but you keep on believing
Believing in some kind of magic potion
The one that makes you feel like you ain't never gonna die
The one that makes you cry
Then leaves you in that haze, I guess you will always ramble


Ramble, when this world gives you more than you can handle
You get on those two wheels and go back to outer space
Win that one man race
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, outrun your sorrows and ramble

"Shadows on the water
From a memory that turns inside
From the last time I saw you happier
Than I've seen you in a long time

And all these faces, oh how they adore you
With every blessing, every strength of the storm
And it seems to me it all worked out so different
Funny how distance and time they don't change at all

So may your worries, may your worries
Never fall too loud
And may you stay here, may you stay here
Happy in your own skin
On the ninth cloud

Cold to every warning
Oh these ships that passed through, years before
And bolder now, than a brand new morning
With the sun on your face, the bruise and the breaks of these careless arms

So hold your body, hold your body
Strong in these winds that blind
And may you stay here, may we sit together when we're grey and old
On cloud nine

This life will move you with every step outside
It's alright, it's alright
My arms are open wide for you
This life will move you as graceful as the tide
It's alright, it's alright
Loosen the fears that fears that bind you
Loosen the fears that fears that bind you

As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke

There's another ghost here
He sits down in your chair
And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night

I'm just a shadow upon these walls
I'm living proof of the damage
Heartbreak does

Standin' at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hardwood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can’t get it back
Let’s face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step
And said, ""I see the way out and I‘m gonna take it""


I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted


Another glass of whiskey, but it still don’t kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said, ""It's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it""


'Cause I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'

Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl


Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care


Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide


That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted all right to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?


The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said ""Thank You ladies, if you hear from him let us know""


Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all


So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause...


Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl
Hey


Well hey, hey, hey

Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin' Hennessy, smokin' weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snupe, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shootin' craps in the alley 'til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies, but don't waste it all
Ooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Havin' house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
Lookin' dumb, cause you waitin' for your chance to hump
Straight grindin', everybody havin' fun
And it's cool, 'til a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool, now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushin' and I'm rushin' to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lyin'
Why? I seen her talkin' to this other guy and
He's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin', I just hope he get 'em, I got nuttin but love


Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya

I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
And pay respect to the place that I came from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin'
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin' double dutch
Still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uhh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love


Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love

When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers gettin' rich slangin' crack to folks
And the square's gettin' big for these sack of dope
Started thinkin' bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
'Til the dealer on the block told me, ""That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool""
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tried to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uhh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinkin', since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nuttin but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love


Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Yeah, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Yeah, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya

I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen 
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside

Feeling your ambition crumble away
As the power within you began to decay
Never finding what you were searching for
And feeling a longing you couldn't ignore
You felt it ache inside like never before


Take the path that the weak ones demonize
Look around and begin to realize


That you're no longer alone tonight
You're coming into your own tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight


The burden you bear can cripple you
A ravenous cancer, eating your soul
Lost within a world beyond your control
So tonight, let there be a reckoning
Let this moment empower you to no end
Let the doubts within you, start to descend


Take the path that the weak ones demonize

Number one fantasy on my list, I even did it once in my dream
Ooh, that damn ménage, could it really be happening?
Baby, how you gon' tease me, tuckin' dollars all between your thighs
Ooh, that girl got ass, you should make an exception tonight


Whoa, whoa
She getting more change than the players 
Whoa, whoa 
She putting fingers up to the haters, yeah 
Whoa, whoa
When she go it, it look so good 
Like I said she don't go both ways 
But this is making me wish she would 


'Cause my girl like them girls
It's alright, it's okay
My girl like them girls
It's alright, it's okay
So I let her, let her do her thing 
I even let her make it rain 
My girl like them girls
She like them girls, oh yeah
Oh, didn't know that she liked them girls 
Didn't know she—


She liked the one with the tattooed thighs 
I think they call her Sunshine 
And if she wanna cross the line, I don't care 
'Cause ain't nobody gotta know 
And we can keep it on the low 
And if you wanna take her home, we can share


My girl like them girls
It's alright, it's okay 
My girl like them girls 
It's alright, it's okay 
So I let her, let her do her thing

Some things last, sometimes you never get over
Live in the past, you find out it's hard to stay sober
My see-through skin like urethane
Lost and then found, on view for all and I wouldn't trade


You'd never know a long time ago you were frowning
Thinkin' it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know


It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog


Some people change, sometimes you leave how it oughta be
Find a new way to come clean, let it wash over me
My see-through heart like urethane
Beats for you proud, up down and through all the love and pain


You'd never know a long time ago you were crowning
Thinkin' it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know


It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog


Left me here so all alone, only for me to find
Hear your voice on waves we rode, echoes inside my mind
Disembodied just a trace of what it was like then
With you here we shared a space that's always half empty

Grinding, grinding on
Always half empty
Grinding, grinding on
Always half empty


So we can laugh it's inside, never hear me complain
My see-through city of cellophane
You'd never know a long time ago you were drowning
Thinking it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know


It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog


Reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog

Downtown we let it go
Sunset high and our bodies low
Blood rush in the hazy glow
My hands, your bones
Looser we break the scene
One step deep as you fall to me
Heart clap, we skip a beat
Count one, two, three


And don’t you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it

Your name I’ll never know
As we get down in the world below
Caught up in an overflow
My hands, your bones
Wide eyed, you look at me
Set on fire in a silver dream
Spin round you can feel the breeze
Count one, two, three

Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
Sucker for love


I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be, you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up


Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me, say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it
But in this case, what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin' promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep it goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head, I’m feelin' low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You're gettin’ calls at the house, guess you're cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up


Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you, a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it, now I’m under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

You tried everything, but you don't give up

Took some dabs last night, now I'm back to no wax

Fuck it, I'll consume whatever
Pills are better whenever the going gets tough

Climb in and laugh, until the grass is growin' through my skull

But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright
The sunset built a memory, our love sign
And all at sea we come alive
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home
I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I design
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all at sea we say goodbye

And that could be a shame
'Cause though I think I know another lonely exile when I see one
And you appear to be one

Still...

I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found if you've got it to spare
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel 'cause I oughta be there

Ray, what can I say?
You don't know me, and it's just wishful thinking to keep myself from sinking
And hence, no evidence to support any theory I have handy
If you could understand me

I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel 'cause I oughta be there

'Cause you're as bad off as me...

Ray, can we repay ourselves for days that we've lost through indecision
With one of recoginition?
If so, then here I go, 'cause some things you know...
And some you just believe in
And hope it comes out even

And every time I come home
Some more of me it isn't there
I gotta get it together
I need to do things for myself

Come on, come on
Tell me we'll be okay
Lets go back, lets go back
To a time where I still felt I had a family

Just be warned, I'll be taking most of you with me

We swore to each other then our love would surely last
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast
Now I am too thin and your love is too vast


But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine

I choose the rooms that I live in with care
The windows are small and the walls almost bare
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer
I listen all night for your step on the stair

And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine

Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free

I've fallen from grace, I've made mistakes, wondering
Wishing that I could just change the past, babe
One day, my love could change again

So I'm leaping off the ledge with no pressure


Like an acrobat or a fighter jet
I'll just soar through the air 'cause I'm so fearless
When I reach my mark, hope that it's your heart

Just so I scream geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling
Geronimo
No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away
Yeah, yeah, I'll base jump, base jump
For your love


Up in the rain, as I'm falling through the storm
And the lightning's in my face, girl, you're beautiful
Oh what a day 'cause girl, it ain't the usual
And the sky is bright now
And I can feel it 'cause I'm getting closer
And no one else gave me a chance to fly
Feels like I'm in outer space
And your gravity's pulling me down right now


Like an acrobat or a fighter jet
I'll just soar through the air 'cause I'm so fearless 
When I reach my mark, hope that it's your heart
At the end, it's all worth it


Just so I scream geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling

No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you  I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away 
Yeah, yeah , I'll base jump, base jump

Base jump, base jump for your love

All their problems and hurt of pride
You make me so happy sweet baby
Love is by my side
Waking up now in the morning
A little morning sigh
Ready not to get it together
We know temptation
Don't tell the whole story
But you and me baby
We have taken inventory
We Blue Monday people
And I know there's a few
I don't know your problems
Only you know how to solve them
When seasons are strong
Sometimes your life don't get along
But when cupboards are bare
Our love we can share
Truth is not the whole question
What is the answer you hide?
The system need us
But it's trying to mislead us
They know this money don't feed us
Depression ain't just
Quite what you promised
Won't you mister be honest
Acting like a child
Sometimes we get wild
Right when the loving is strong
We don't want to get along
Don't have to listen to me
One day you may see
We Blue Monday people
Just trying in a strain
Life breaking our hearts
I'm so tired it's a shame
This hustling affair
Ain't the way I even care
We'll be together in spite
Of the crimes of the night
Crimes of the night

Need someone to see me through
Need someone to comfort me

She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah

We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air

In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars
The endless search for where you are


Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from another world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!

And just for the pain, I take OxyContin
Gave my dawg a watch to pass the time
And she be in New York half the time
When I drop the top, you see ashes flying
Walked in Onyx, seen asses flying
She told me that her number was classified
I said bitch, you should ask for mine!
Sippin' margaritas in Miami with my mamacita
All-Star Game, she was in the bleachers
Every time I see her, I say nice to meet ya
Had it in the room girl, underneath her




Met her at Live on Sunday
She was in Atlanta on Monday
Club going up on a Tuesday
Told her she can get it how she want it
I ain't picky, I ain't got a type
I'm single, I ain't got a wife
But if I hit you with the slow-stroke
I bet that you gonna spend the night
I bet you find another flight because she just wanna love the life
Seen her out in Cali, man in Vegas she was at the fight
Sunday at the rehab, beat the pussy made her relapse

Makes you say ""Oh no""
Cause you're the class president
Without Jackie O
And I'm singing happy birthday
Like Marilyn Monroe



This is not a school girl crush

This is not a puppy love,
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

This is not a school girl thing

What about the diamond ring? 
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it baby


It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love


You make me wanna be
Like one of those girls
Calender pin-up queen and platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose
Golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snacks of
Veuve Clicquot with Ho-Ho's
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it home
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe



This is not a school girl crush

This is not a puppy love,

Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

This is not a school girl thing

Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it baby, baby, baby


And if I call you on the telephone
I might overdose
Cause I'm strong, but I'm lonely like Marilyn Monroe

This is not a school girl crush
This is not a puppy love
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold m and trust me babe



This is not a school girl crush

When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door
And leave me standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on


The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
Oooohhhh


You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble and fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all


Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else
I gotta go

Emptiness and everlasting madness
See the sadness grow, watching as we know
Long before our journey for the world
Call for us, the power in all of us
So far beyond the blackened sky tonight...
Glorious, forever more in us
We are victorious, and so alive


We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow
Our journey on towards a brighter day
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away
Across the endless sands
Through the fields of our despair
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah
Rise above the universe tonight
Starchaser...

Fly towards the storm, see the world reborn
Feel the pain inside the voice of sorrow
Cross the distant shores, find the open door
Stand alone, in judgment for tomorrow

Years of pain still haunt us all, we saw the last sunrise
Take me home, in freedom, for a lifetime...
Pray now for the silence, and the last tears we'll cry
So glorious, this fire inside, united we stand


And we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow
Our journey on towards a brighter day
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away
Across the endless sands
Through the fields of our despair
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah
Rise above the universe tonight

Free from this world, here for the last time
Oceans collide inside of us all
Believe who we are
The phoenix will guide us
Freedom will rise once again

Save us tonight, the last hope for all of us
Light-years gone by, we're still holding on
Save us tonight, a star shines in all of us
Far beyond our lives, still our glory lives on


And we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow
Our journey on towards a brighter day
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away

As I am unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a Queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream

To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly

This a relationship, a scholarship, a free ride
Say that you do everything you don't
Remember all the late nights when I cried?
Hate that I’m now *67 on your phone
Calling blocked, I’m all alone
And you know that I can't sleep, baby
Lord knows I've tried
But I hate when you're away from me, baby
Only 'posed to be mine

Of twisted white debris

And when summer gets to me
And sets the heart in motion

And sex is sex forget the rest
The only one that's free
The only great adventure left
To humankind that's you and me

And tries to make me tired
I'm living every minute
And dying every three

She said what she wants is a man to be faithful
A true heart somebody willing and able
To stay by her side through thick and thin
A tender touch every now and then
She's not hung up on fairy tales
Or some dream at the bottom of a wishing well
Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things


That's what she gets
That's what she gets
That's what she gets for loving me
Mmm-hmm


At times, I lay awake at night
Stare at her laying by my side
Knowing there in her heart as she sleeps
She can forever count on me


That's what she gets
That's what she gets
That's what she gets for loving me


Whatever turns her on
I'm here to do it
'Till the day they write my name in stone

Walking through the trees, I never really know what's on your mind
Is it ever me, or just someone you've left behind?
Floating through a dream, I never could make out the words you said
Sentences are bouncing back and forth inside my head


You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police, we can find comfort in debauchery


Fighting through the fog, I can't believe it rained all summer long
When every day's a hurricane, you know there's something wrong
I see you every day, it's hard to figure out what happens next
I cannot decipher conversation in your head


You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police, we can find comfort in debauchery
You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the local police, we can find comfort in biology


We wrote our names on the overpass and I hope it lasts forever
Don't have to
You don't have to


You don't have to leave, you could just stay here with me
Forget all the party police, we could find comfort in debauchery

Rearrange, reactions in my brain
Redefine my pain
Been wishin' I could change
Hard to change my ways
Trained a certain way
Afraid of my own fate
Just another phase


Lost cause and a lost child
Lost my way tryna change for the wrong crowd

Though many tried

My life behind
I dug some graves

But never mind

Never mind
Never mind
The war was lost

There's truth that lives
And truth that dies

Your victory
Was so complete
Some among you
Thought to keep
A record of
Our little lives
The clothes we wore
Our spoons our knives

The games of luck
Our soldiers played
The stones we cut
The songs we made
Our law of peace
Which understands
A husband leads
A wife commands

And all of these
Expressions of the
Sweet indifference
Some called love
The high indifference
Some call fate
But we had names
More intimate

Names so deep
And names so true
They're blood to me

And this survives
There's Truth that lives
And Truth that dies

You side with them whom
You despise

This swarm of flies
This was once your mouth
This bowl of lies

I left behind
I live it full
I live it wide
Through layers of time
You can't divide

My woman's here
My children too
Their graves are safe
From ghosts like you
In places deep
With roots entwined
I live the life
I left behind

Do you remember
Fast times in the summer rain?
The cold in December
Was it all a dream?
Tell me you're alright
Tell me that I didn't mean a thing
Lie to my face now
Say anything


And I'll always remember to never forget you
I'll always remember to never forget


Say you'll come find me
When I'm dancing in the streets
I don't need money, don't need sleep
Just need your pretty face, now
Say you'll come find me
When I'm dancing in the streets
We don't need money don't need sleep
Just need a bottle and a beat
Just a bottle and a beat


Will you forgive me
Over a whiskey in the rain
Is there a shelter
From all this pain
Tell me you were right, darling
Tell me that you knew me all too well
Instead of going to bed now
Feels like I'm going to hell


And I'll always remember to never forget you
I'll always remember to never forget


Say you'll come find me
When I'm dancing in the streets
I don't need money, don't need sleep
Just need your pretty face, now

Just need a bottle and a beat

Pull me close now
Like a candle in the rain
I will surrender
To you again

I'll always remember to never forget

"The hidden flaw of man is his insatiable desire to dominate though he can only feel complete when everybody sees what he sees

From this dependence, mankind gains weakness; sickening from a lack of progress
It feeds off the instability of the weaker through manipulation, fears and lies
The collective abide

What one man accomplishes alone becomes envy of the frail
The feeble aim to deprive him of this ambition
It is this insubordination of the individual that agitates society's strive for the preservation of its normalcy
As if it lingered

The herd casts a veil that everyone is all one in the same, but this could never be further from the truth
It is this myth that the weaker grasps in desperation to justify the denial of profit

The depth of humanity's adversity entrenches beyond abysmal scales when it grasps on mirages of promises
Society falls while the collective dances to the waltz in synchronized formation; tethered to chains welded with lies

“Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! Step right up! We welcome you this glorious evening to witness the degradation of our fellow man
Seven billion performers will show you what you won't see elsewhere! I bring to you, the human sheep!”

No halo hovering, follow me in yo' grave
Ain't got no Patek because I'll be here 'till the end of fucking times

Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...


He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow

Shoot across the night sky from a G4 side

I bought my girl a diamond
It was our engagement ring
She took it to a pawn shop
Like it didn't mean a thing
She went right out and bought herself
A brand new party dress
She'll be looking good tonight
When we go out I guess


She's a cool drink of water
She's done hocked the ring I bought her
She might be the devil's daughter
But she's a cool drink of water


I took her to a night club
Where we used to go a lot
The beer is cold and frosty
And the band is blazing hot
I went back for a refill
And this guy walked up and said
There's a blonde out on the dance floor
Turning everybody's head




Well I'd had on too many
So she took my keys to drive
She said we'll have more fun
Tonight if we get home alive
Well that copper clocked her doing
Ninety in a twenty zone
But she didn't get a ticket
Just the number to his phone

Whoohohohohohohoho
Whoohohohohohohoho
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like



Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change


Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga
And pray I don't see the end of my paper like P.S nigga
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
And now we out of high school, you got a fatter ass
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago
Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
I can't even sit here frontin', lie and pretend
Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here
You're telling me how you went down South for school
Down near TSU
But you know business majors
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school
Told her check the Valley, seems like out there they be hiring
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring
A new scenery might just be inspiring
She said ""Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good""


Okay I came up how I came up
A little change but I ain't change up
A little fame but I ain't famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Gettin' high now I'm the supplier now
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Still living how I'm living cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it


Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change


She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top
Spending extra time when she ain't got it, on me
Then she turned around said
""I'm so proud, seems like everywhere I'm hearin' ya
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask""
When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past
Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim
Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand
Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense
And he said ""Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet""
Signed me, got a profit
Few years later yeah we on and poppin'
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in
Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it
Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it
Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody
Oh boy, swerve


Okay I came up how I came up
A little change but I ain't change up
A little fame but I ain't famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous

"Only a Few Things

Only a few things will we recall

With love, with gratitude

Only a few things

On the hour in which I die

So if I cannot tell you

If the words I do not find

I want you to know

There are only a few things

That I will be carrying

In my memory when I go

Only a few things will we recall

With true happiness, with gratitude

Only a few things

I see you

I see you

You, you were the joy in my life

The one who loved my tired bones

The one who came to stay

So if I do not tell you

If I don't find the words

It is NOT because I don't feel it in my heart

You're the one who loved my tired bones

You're the one who took me home

You, you brought joy to my world

So I will tell you now

In case you don't know

That you'll be with me

When I go

Only a few things will we recall

With love, with gratitude

Only a few things

On the hour in which I die

Lost in slumber, a threat to no one
Weak and humbled to my disgrace
Sweet departure, is what I long for
Careless moments to comfort me
Ooh dead philosophy


If I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one, to be dehumanized again
Left behind


Too determined to be forgotten
Nothing left to enrapture me
Hard and silent, softly breaking
No beloved to comfort me
Ooh dead philosophy


If I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one, to be dehumanized again
Left behind


Feel the determination built into my mind
You're never gonna find me, I'll wipe the world away
Your face it will remind me, just how much I have to leave


If I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one to be dehumanized again
Said if I offer you my soul, will you carry me away?
I cannot be the only one, to be dehumanized again
Left behind

I learned how to fall today, didn't think it would kill you
To settle the debt I thought never would be paid
Found out I was wrong today, too weak to continue
One final defense to fall
Still unbroken


Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're going to let it burn
Let it burn, 'til the image fades away


Knew there was a price to pay, didn't think it would thrill you
To witness the fallen one shattered and ashamed
No I'm not the only one yearning to fulfill you
Unwilling to risk it all
Still uncertain


Now I am torn, thought it was over this time
And we know there's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're going to let it burn
Let it burn, 'til the image fades away

You may remember hearing about a murder
In Las Vegas 2 months ago
In which a popular and controversal performer
Was shot
Gang land style and killed
It's a murder that hasn't yet been solved
But the investigation has invited closer scrutiny
Of the music industry



Them same mother fuckers wanta murder me
Them same mother fuckers
Them same mother fuckers wanta murder me



Crazy
I got a work with what you gave me
Claiming I'm a criminal
When you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this holocaust
Heading for my grave G
I told Sam he can fuck the war
& got a busted jaw
For saying fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm Mad check the records
What's a nigga got a do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm Getting tested
& if I dont say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zested
I keep a vest on my chest
Incase the cops are getting restless
Walk around ready to light shit up
& since my life is fucked
Some say I'm slighty nuts
Buck buck is the sound as i mooova
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer
I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see whooo's realer
Now them same motherfuckers want a murder me
& i wonder if the lord ever heard of me

Chorus
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me

Them same mother fuckers want a murder me

Them same mother fuckers want a murder me

Crying over some old memory

Counting long enough to fall asleep

You and me, we're cut from the same cloth
It seems to some we famously get along
But you and me are strangers to each other
Cause you and me: competitive to the bone
Such tragedy to trample on each other
With how much we've endured, with the state this land is in
You and me feel joined only by gender
We are not all for one and one for all


Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in


You and me estranged from the mother
You and me have felt impotent in our skin
You and me have taken it out on each other
You and me disloyal to the feminine
Such a pity to disavow each other
With how far we've come, with how strong we've been
You and me are on this pendulum together
You and me with scarcity still fueling


Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in


We may not have priorities same
We may not even like each other
We may not be hugely anti-men
But such a cost to dishonor a sister


You and me have made it harder for the other
We forget how hard separatism has been
You and me we can help change their minds together
You and me in alignment until the end


Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in
Sister blister we fight to please the brothers

I walk in on Friday nights
Same old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place?


Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same


We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you


They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missing all of the times


We were the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you


Ain't it funny how a flame like that
Oh whoa, when they think of you
It can burn when it's in the past

Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them

 
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal


Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make

Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make

 
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal


But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

 
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal


There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go, I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go, I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home


Standing on a bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my Grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time

I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking laying in that box, people look so still

At times like these, you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud

I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defense from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme
And get away from the grey just a bit at a time


Yeah, kind of funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing out of cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones

My life's like trying to swallow a pine cone
It's tough when you live fast just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems, so I sleep underneath this park bench

I know it don't make sense
And I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my sight
Push rocks in a pipe
Lift off, I'll keep puffing 'til my lips turn white

And my chest gets tight, but who the fuck really cares
When you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday, these...


These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go, I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go, I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home


Yo, pardon me, I think I'm next to hurl
Too many problems going on, that's why I left my girl
Pack my backs and I travel with a pen and my notepad
They said I was broken, all the things that I don't have

But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, see I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but now I'm awake in the storm

Writin' my life in the short film, the rise and the fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the wall
Pound pavement, aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing, I'm going the distance

Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
To put it all behind me 'cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger and know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over, again


These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry
Trying to get by and trying not to feel outta control

And if you look hard enough, sometimes you'll find
A place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, you can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone


Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home

Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home

Get your hands up
It’s the apocalypse
Got a mouth full of lambs’ blood
The dam broke down
The whole town flooded
Your man couldn’t cut it
Got his fake ass gutted
He muttered something monotone
Under his breath
Now he’s out first round
With his hand on his chest
Must have been a cardiac
Now he’s searching for his Pontiac
To get back to a bar attack
To brush up on his battle rap
We hit the hi-hats and make it clap
We wear plaid after Labor Day and still get ass
We’re high-class, low brow, over bomb beats
Cloggin’ more arteries than the drive-thru at Arby’s


Singin’ I love rock ‘n’ roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

Stiffer than a zombie
Gagged with Abercrombie while your girl rides up on me
And I’m callin’ up your sister and we’re cuddling to Amélie

So you walk eight miles and you think you can rap

When the lights have turned to grey
On the dawning final day
See the sun now fade away
Can we find the words to say
All the times we fought in vain
Though the years and seasons change
But we all still feel the same
As we stand before the world


Feel the engines fire
Feel the thunder rise
Now touch the path of glory
Power to the turbo drive
Hot wheels of fire burn strong
Flash lightning fries the brain
On a course to no tomorrow
Driving all of us insane
City lights laid out before us
Go forth for now your time has come
Now your time has come


In a flash of blue steel, to the far horizons
Supersonic power, on the wings of a dream
Down the roads so far, with nowhere to hide
Like a star shooting right from the sky
Slow down for no one, never look back now tonight


Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion


500 miles an hour
All gravity defied
We touched the taste of glory
So close the finish line
Bright lights still glare before us
Give it up for now your time has come
Now your time has come


Like a demon on wheels, through the cursed blue mountains
Don’t let a minute go by, give it all till the end
On a one way street living in the fast lane
Feel the passion that runs through your veins
Faster with fury to the end of all our days


Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion


We live for the night
We long for the day
The glory forever
Forever we fight aside from the knight locked out in space, hey




A lifetime of dreaming
But don't ever stop believing
The passion, the fight deep inside
The power before me
I'm sent to the edge of glory
Tonight, shooting, fall across the sky


Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion
Oblivion
Woah, woah, woah

"Non ci caschi più, solo adesso lo dici tu
Come hai fatto a innamorarti di quel cesso
Tu ascoltavi le emozioni, lui pensava ai suoi quattrini
E ti ha usato solamente per il sesso
Che delusione
Hai sporcato la tua vita col carbone
Che delusione
Quanto costa adesso un pezzo di sapone
Balle e ancora balle alla luce delle stelle
Le hai bevute tutte quante giù in un fiato
Quanta ingenuità, l'ho lasciata qua e là
Sei finita nella trappola del topo
Che delusione
Nel vederti con un uomo di cartone
Che delusione
Lo credevi vero ed era un gran cialtrone

Ero sincero e ti amavo come sai
Tu non hai capito niente e adesso come stai
Dimentichiamo tutto quanto se tu vuoi
Ma non dimentichiamoci di noi

Ma tu non hai capito
Si è nascosto dietro a un dito
Chi è gentile qualche volta può far male
Un discorso inzuccherato e così ti ha imbambolato
Che peccato che rimane in bocca il sale
Che delusione
So che hai pianto per un uomo di cartone
Che delusione
Cerchi forse ancora l'oro nel carbone

Ero sincero e ti amavo come sai
Tu non hai capito niente e adesso come stai
Dimentichiamo tutto quanto se tu vuoi
Ma non dimentichiamoci di noi

Che delusione, so che hai pianto per un uomo di cartone
Che delusione, cerchi forse ancora l'oro nel carbone...

Amerie, Ludacris remix!
We sippin' on a little Veuve with the orange label
Hershey's syrup from your lips to your navel
Head coming off the table
I'm willing and able, and love it when you get mad
After ssssss, then wiping you down with warm rags
I'm rich—how did I do it? Man, I take 'em under
It's 'cause I roll craps with Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder
So tell me what you need 'cause it's so important
That I make you feel good like Billy Bob Thornton, c'mon!


So many things I'm goin' through
So much that I wanna do
It's startin' to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly, you and I
And fall in love, so many reasons why


Why don't we 
Why don't we, why don't we  Why don't we, fall in love

It's so many reasons; it's the only thing that matters to me



It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one I never want to go
Things I never did now I want to do
A love I never felt, now I feel for you
Why don't I just swallow each and every ounce of my pride?
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend


Why don't we 
Why don't we, what don't we 
Why don't we fall in love? 
Why don't we, why don't we, why don't we fall in love?
Oh, fall in love

Hey
Come with me
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, no


Black lights, stamina, uh, uh, uh action!
You been gettin more butterflies than Mike Jackson
'Cause me and you together will meet as one
I'll fly from New York to LA and beat the sun
My other woman never listens when I wish she would
But I wonder can she hear me now...GOOD!
Tell her I'm a King sippin' Cask and Cream
Your hearts jumpin' like a rabbit on a trampoline
She's got pretty feet, big lips, mean body
I spiced up her life, made her Josephine Johnny
She drippy-drop, wobble, wobble and shake, shake
And every time we jump in the sack she can't wait
To unleash the fury, scratch my back
Then i'm pullin out her hair like track per track
See, I'm an 8 figure nigga, we can ball above
So I'mma Disturb Tha Peace, you can fall in love
I'mma Disturb Tha Peace, you can fall in love


Baby, let's be
Why don't we, why don't we, why don't we fall in love?
Why don't we, why don't we, why don't we fall in love?

You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want


I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine


I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts


Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say
And lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name?
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go


I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

That's a promise, not a threat and it ain't no half-steppin' 
Can't  let it compromise the pace I'm settin' 
Grandma  told me don't forget to count my blessings 
Breakin' up botanicals to ease my stressin'
Was  the one that you needed but you weren't expectin'
Game need refreshin' , what you been suggestin'? 
Wrote a new constitution, we don't need amendin' 
I go Johnnie Cochran when I'm raisin' my defenses 
Man,  I feel like Michael Keaton when a nigga start ascendin' 
Never second-guessin' , had to do a lot of restin'

Listen, I ain't for the shelvin', what you niggas tellin'?

Bonafide big brr lookin' like a Yeti 
Swift feet cheetah, that's a real big kitty
Who made y'all judges? That's a real ass feeling
I don't like the sly ones, forget 'em and I dead 'em 
Always off the shit like a constipated reverend 
Y'all don't like to shit talk, dumb pun, all fun

Goofy ass boy, look like Elmer Fudd's cousin 
Heavy-ass feet, bet Pluto heard you comin'

I'm just havin' fun, cops hit me, goddamn it


Trauma got me fucked up, my mama got me fucked up
My lil' nigga locked up, it's like Hakuna Matata
Never liked sci-fi, empathetic wifi
Keep it in the back room, hidin' with my dry eye
Put it in the vacuum, I got love for my label
Fifteen million on the table, none of my niggas is stable
Need a personal connection, I just wanna feel you, baby
Bein' sober made me realize how poorly I been behavin', uh

Trauma the price for the patience

I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven


Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears


I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears


Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears


Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears


Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come


Lord! 
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers


And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears


Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

And shed so many tears

And I'll be crushin' it, yeah I'll be crushin' it

They say your baby's mad cause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head, looks at you and says
""Ain't you good for anything?"" and you say

Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a, fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

Gettin' niggas fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya

Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops

While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches

Talkin' quicker then a vic that's tryin' to keep from gettin' blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa, turn this Benz into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggas bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin' reckless
Niggas with a death wish step in with a TEC and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
True to what I'm writing, representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm what's mine
Some niggas need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me, nigga, and get blasted
With five deadly venomz





We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
To the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin' mother out
And after she's crossed out

Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin' pounds more

Pickin' pockets with a razor stoppin' Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin' shop
Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten

It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin' styles in 'em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom


Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin' 'em down, I make 'em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
MAC-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make 'em scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, something that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit 'em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom





Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggas can't touch me when I wreckin' G you better flee
'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking all fake niggas back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin' in 'em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom





Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin' and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggas don't even worry me, see
I got a Glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggas need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everyday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I passed let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now your mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin' blunts
Deadly venomz





Throw up your middle finger! Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'mma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin' trigger
I'm a cinch in a clinch, your punch is like a pinch.
Test the rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin' up pooh-butts, cut 'em like cold cuts
Choke 'em with my boot lace, then leave 'em hangin' like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get 'em

"I got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It sits in silence; eats away at me
It feeds like cancer
This guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know

This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings now I'll count this curse

The only thing I really know
I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret

I got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

I may look happy but honestly dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips as all the shame spills out of me

Repent, repent! The end is nigh
Repent, repent! We're all gonna die
Repent, repent! These secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for... forgiveness

We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in Him... Why would He believe in me?

Why would He believe in me?
Why would He believe in me?
Why would He believe in me?
Why would He believe in me?

It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs

I know something you don't know

"You tried to turn away my fears
Shouting metaphysics in my fifteen year old ears
I dreamed all day of sneaking out the window
A sigh for every other breath
When you are joyful I feel better
You catch a cold that lasts forever
A quest and we are hiding in the shadows
Beneath blue blazers and the smell of old books
Your eyes are blue, your voice is deep
In half a verse you sung my whole, whole world to sleep
And in a classroom underground
I am still aching for that old still sound
Then we know that patience is the most important part
What's the point of being patient for a broken heart?
I wish I was as passive as a patient on a table
It seems to me that you will die as soon as you are able

Til I rocked to Africa

I parted the weeds
And I looked over the swamp
And I seen them cats doin' the Ubangi Stomp

It beats anything that's ever been told
Ubangi Stomp, Ubangi style
When it kicks
It drives a cool cat wild

Well I looked up the chief;
He invited me in
He said, ""A heap big jam session's 'bout to begin.""
I grabbed up a tom and I picked up the beat
That crazy thing sent
Shivers to my feet

And I skipped with a smile
I did the Ubangi Stomp with a Ubangi style

Well, we rocked all night and part of the day
Had a good, rock-in' time
With the chief's daughter Mae
I'm makin' good time and I'm gettin' in the know
When the captain said, ""Son, we've gotta go.""
I said, ""That's all right
You go right ahead
I'm gonna Ubangi Stomp til I roll over dead.""

Brave and grant
On English ground we were born
Proudly we return to English shores

Join, raise your hand or hide when we ride for the crown

I was lonely and lived by myself
Baby, that's a battle you can't win
So we met and we started the clock
Did that help -- no it did not
But I guess I knew that going in
And watched the sweeping second hand


But at least I was calm
On the road to the big observatory
Where the planets were hung
And the stars swung around the second story
And we stumbled upon
A room where a luminous moon was waning
And I knew I had leapt into the great beyond
But at least I was calm


Fun is fun, but when push comes to shove
When it's done, we'll deny it was love
She will say Jim -- this was a mistake
And the room where we looked at the sky
Will be there with its telescope eye
Just another sentry kept awake
Watching over silverlake

And the stars swung around the second story

Tarot cards and the lines in my hand
Tell me I'm wrong

To a place I've seen in a magazine that you left lying around

Than to see there come the day

Runnin' scared with his devils, sayin' prayers all through the night
But mercy can't find him, not in the shadows where he calls
Forsaking all his better angels: That's how every empire falls


The bells ring out on Sunday morning like echoes from another time
All our innocence and yearning and sense of wonder left behind
Oh gentle hearts remember, What was that story? Is it lost?
For when religion loses vision, That's how every empire falls


He toasts his wife and all his family, the providence he brought to bear
They raise their glasses in his honor although this union they don't share
A man who lives among them was still a stranger to them all
For when the heart is never open, That's how every empire falls


Padlock the door and board the windows, put the people in the street
""It's just my job,"" he says, ""I'm sorry,"" and draws a check, goes home to eat
At night he tells his woman, ""I know I hide behind the laws""
She says, ""You're only taking orders"": That's how every empire falls


A bitter wind blows through the country, a hard rain falls on the sea
If terror comes without a warning, there must be something we don't see
What fire begets this fire, like torches thrown into the straw?
If no one asks, then no one answers: That's how every empire falls

Ten thousand side by side
With swords drawn, held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee, our infantry
Still brave, beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now

Kill, kill, Ohohohoh
Kill, kill, Ohohoh
Kill, kill, Ohohohoh
Kill, kill, Ohohohohoh

Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride

Victory, victory, Ohohohoh
Victory, victory, Ohohoh
Victory, victory, Ohohohoh
Victory, victory, Ohohohohoh

To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space, no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time
We'll catch the wind

Kill, kill, Ohohohoh

But she's the prettiest thing in my life at last

I can't believe the way you hold me

Oh, I wanna dance with my sweet love sixteen

Oh, the fellows wanna just touch her or hold her hand real tight
But she is the prettiest thing out here tonight, gentlemen
If the dancing gets good to you, lay down in your shawl
You try to move your body, you might lose control, tell you one thing

Summer was gone and the heat died down
And Autumn reached for her golden crown
I looked behind as I heard a sigh
But this was the time of no reply


The sun went down and the crowd went home
I was left by the roadside all alone
I turned to speak as they went by
But this was the time of no reply


The time of no reply is calling me to stay
There is no hello and no goodbye
To leave there is no way


The trees on the hill had nothing to say
They would keep their dreams till another day
So they stood and thought and wondered why
For this was the time of no reply


Time goes by from year to year
And no one asks why I am standing here
But I have my answer as I look to the sky
This is the time of no reply


The time of no reply is calling me to stay
There`s no hello and no goodbye
To leave there is no way

And Autumn reached for her golden crown

Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much
Nothing can heal me now, but your touch
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you


Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way
But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray
Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you


Boys in the street beginning to play
Girls like birds flying away
When I’m gone you will remember my name
I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you


Junk is piling up, taking up space
My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face
Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor
I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’till I fell in love with you


Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain
My attempts to please you were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound
I just don’t know what I’m gonna do

Like a fever or a flame
Takes me over
Let it just fly
This star has wings and now so have I
Close my eyes ready for sleep
Let it rise up from the deep

In the distance but not forgiven
This human heart still feels the same
But you consume it

And my pillow you are again
In my dreams still you talk

Keep Your Head Up

I’m just a thug on the other side of the law
Raised in the hood, never thought I’d make it this far
I went from standing on the block dealing, totting my Glock
Weighing product on a triple beam
I even got hassled a lot, mainly by crooked cops
Life wasn’t easy as it seems!

Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind

Stay on the grind, stay on the grind

Gets harder everyday to come up with the rent
And ain’t got a job 
Trying to keep the bills paid
But don’t wanna get locked up no more! 
See my Parolee Officer almost caught me with that stuff
Tossed it so he wouldn’t find a trace! 
Not to mention my baby mama, the bitch is greedy as fuck
Got child support steady on my case

Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind

Gotta a little personal but let me break it down
I’m not the only one out here that’s going through it now
It’s international, recession's all around
We gotta be here for each other when it hit the ground
I know your hurtin'  and workin' 
Don't give up it will all work out 
Can’t ever stop hopin' , for certain 
I’ll be grinding until the day that I die!

Man I finna do my thang 
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there mayne 
Trust me homie I'm not playin' 
I have the dance floor off the chain, I said 
I came to bring you that California love
And a little New York hate, it's all of the above
I'm not playin', I said I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow instructions, I said 


I ball ‘til I fall, stunt 'til I drop
'Em off the showroom floor, not the used car lot
You buy a bottle, I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras
When I get into it, I get into it
Everybody can’t do it the way I do it
I make it rain, till the sun come out
A nigga playin', we make the guns come out
Now, my question is who they gon' blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit shift now, the game done changed
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I made the kids want slang
And N.W.A. made the West Coast bang
Nah, it's just music man, it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it


I have the savoir-faire
I’m the reason, everybody, here, I said

Yeah, lady, you look good, I wanna get to know you better
You look good in them jeans and them red stilettos
You got a Bentley Coupe booty baby, I wanna drive
See it'll tell you what your mileage is when I'm inside
I wanna take you for a spin, you know, round and round
Switch gears till' your love comes down
I take you to the point of no return if you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn, I got money to burn
While they can't get a place, she drop the bomb on me
It's up and down and up and down gracefully
Rick James would've said She a Brick House
But Fifty you should go home and see what that bitch bout
I find out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up, get ya some, I know how to get ya sprung
Tune ya up and use the tongue, under the hood is so good
She said it so good, goddamn I'm so hood, nigga what up?

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?

Always wanna talk it through - I'm OK
Always have to comfort you every day

I have become a silent movie
The hero killed the clown


Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound


Nobody knows what he's doing
Still hanging around


Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound


The slow motion moves me
The monologue means nothing to me


Bored in the role, but he can't stop
Standing up to sit back down
Or lose the one thing found


Spinning the world like a toy top
'Til there's a ghost in every town


Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound


Eyes locked and shining
Can't you tell me what's happening?


Why should you want any other
When you're a world within a world?
Why should you want any other
When you're a world within a world?
Why should you want any other

Tommy got off at the Texaco
Came busting in to Norma's Cafe
Said come on man, we gotta go, yeah
You know how those party girls hate to wait
Filled up his daddy's trunk with ice and beer and
Yeah, he was always stealing the old man's car
Radio never came in too clear
So I'd bang out one on my piece of junk guitar


Yeah, we ruled from the blacktop
To the levee where the party never stopped
Yeah there was power in the night
The spirit was alive when we would sing
Ah, sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
When we were kings
When we were kings


Sitting around the fire one night Tommy called my name
I turned around, he said, ""hey what do you think?""
Had his arm around the prettiest girl I'd ever seen
He kissed her hard and took another drink
I said you must be an angel putting up with this guy
She laughed and said play me some Rolling Stone
I couldn't let that chance go by
Yeah I, I sang ""You Can't Always Get What you Want""


Yeah, we ruled from the blacktop
To the levee where the party never stopped
Yeah there was power in the night
The spirit was alive when we would sing
Ah, sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
When we were kings
When we were kings


Yeah, that was the fall of '69
I guess Uncle Sam was hedging his bet
Tommy's number came up, he said ""Hey, I'll be fine""
""I'll teach 'em a lesson they'll never forget""
Angel and I went to wave goodbye
I guess we always thought we'd see him again
You know, I took her out after that a couple of times, but
We always just wound up talking 'bout him


Yeah, we ruled from the blacktop
To the levee where the party never stopped
Yeah there was power in the night
The spirit was alive when we would sing
Ah, sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
When we were kings
When we were kings


Yeah, sha na na na na na na na

We've ruined everything, a dream designed to fall
The world won't mourn us when we're dead and gone, dead and gone
Accepting our fate, our backs against the wall
The cycle of destruction goes on and on

Caught in the headlights, guilty of murder

Aunt Mattie bent a thousand times down the long black rows
Then battled with the angry weeds so little seeds could grow
Come summer Mattie pulled the snow from cruel and cutting bolls
She was patient pale and slender and was only eight years old
Round and round the spinning wheel beneath Aunt Mattie's boot
She recalled the soil and cotton seeds and summer's hopeful shoots
Two winters spun out summer's threads in rich and creamy folds
And she had a bolt of cotton cloth when she turned ten years old


If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world


Indigo and lavender made up Aunt Mattie's sky
Remembering her childhood days she made the rustic dye
The hour before the day would end it fed young Mattie's dream
She made indigo and lavender when she turned just fourteen


If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world


Aunt Mattie bends a thousand times down each patchwork row
Piece by piece and stitch by stitch in fading candle glow
The valley of the shadow cannot call her from her seams
Until finishing her lifetime's work she dies at seventeen


If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world

"Hurt once and for all into silence
A long pain ending without a song to prove it

Who could stand beside you so close to Eden
When you glinted in every eye the held-high razor
Shivering every ram and son?

Now, silent looney-bin
Where the shadows live in the rafters like day-weary bats
Until the turning mind, a radar signal
Lures them to exaggerate mountain-size on the white stone wall
Your tiny limp

How can I leave you in such a house?
Are there no more saints and wizards
To praise their ways with pupils
No more evil to stun with the slap of a wet red tongue?

Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
And rest because he had finally come?

Let me cry help beside you, teacher
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son enters his father's house

A grand blank look on your face
When you learned it was over
Do you ever question why?
What could have been different?
We were so comfortable
Living in each others skin
I was dying from within

Chorus:
Cause God, drugs, and sex don't mean a thing
To you now, do they now baby?
I don’t mean anything
By it now, do I now sweetheart?
You should have thought about then for now
God drugs and sex don’t mean a thing
To you now, do they now baby?
You should have thought about then for now
But I’ve gotta leave
I’ve gotta leave

Verse 2:
Tell me where did you learn to love?

Tell me when did your hands grow cold?

If you could go back to yesterday
Would you change it all for me?
If you thought we could be together
Would you believe that

Chorus:
God, drugs, and sex don’t mean a thing
To you now, do they now baby?
I don’t mean anything

Did you not hear me coming around, around?
Did you not see me coming along the way?
Were there brighter lights  leading you astray
Were there brighter lights to guide you away from your love

I don’t mean anything

Would you change it all for me?

Let go, let go of me now

Torn apart and now I wish that we could make a start

It’s so damn hard to believe in anything again
Wise is the optimist
But truth is I don't understand
Haven't figured out much of anything


But strange world
Strange world, strange world


’Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes
We try to help it, but we won't
All we know is that we don't
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
The chips will fall, and so it goes
And it’s all out of our control
All we know is that we don’t


Is this all there is?
Preachers and rocket ships
Have never quite made any sense of it yet
Paul says, ""Let it be""
But the other said, ""The test is key""
I say, ""Where's the line between real and fantasy?""


In this strange world
Strange world, strange world, hey


’Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes
We try to help it, but we won't
All we know is that we don’t
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
The chips will fall, and so it goes
And it's all out of our control
All we know is that we don't

We don't, we don't

All we know is that we don't

Up all night on my mind got me thinking
Wanna stay, can you give me a reason?
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone, but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so


Don't be mean, if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone


Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it


Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?
God, I hope so, but I don't think so


Don't be mean, if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin' hands
'long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight
I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light


And they dance like spirits in the night  in the night 
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night , in the night 
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you


Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, ""Try some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt,"" she said, ""Honey, let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can


She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night 
In the night , Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night , in the night 
Stand right up and let her shoot through me




Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right


Together we moved like spirits in the night, all night
Baby don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night, all night
Stand right up and let it shoot right through you

"Last night
You know you really really
Made me appreciate my life
When you took me to the seventh floor
And closed the door
I didn't stand a chance
Oh oh that night
When my conscience was losing
In that age old fight
Now I've always been a non-believer
A true deceiver
A hit and run romance
Don't you know that when we turned out the light
We were riding on the crest of a tidal wave
Like we were ships in the night
Going nowhere
Last night
When the feeling was missing
But the mood was right
From the moment we took the floor
I knew for sure
We'd play the parts we're expected to
I've done it so many times
Man we're all inmates of the human zoo
Our bodies in control of our minds
I played the jester and you played the fool
You kept forgetting your lines
I had to prompt you with a bourbon or two
Huh, you planned to come all the time
But when we turned out the light
We were riding on the crest of a tidal wave
Like we were ships in the night
Going nowhere 
Oh last night
You know you really really
Gave me something to write about
In the morning it was just the same
I'd lost again
But it won't take me long to forget

For 50 should suck that, for a buck you could fuck that
And you thinking she nasty, but niggas is nasty
Dice game shake em up, praying for a six
The wolves out there hungry, they looking for a lick
Sun down to sun up, they looking for a come up

Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following the footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speaking to a soul
The poisoned air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dying
Because it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clicking of the turnstile and the rattle of his chain
""Oh,"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you""
""Here,"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile""
""See,"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you""
""Lord,"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while""
Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home
Standing in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me""
""Now,"" she said, ""now that you've a family of your own""
""Still,"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body""
""Lord,"" she said, ""Casey it's a shame to be alone!""

Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round


I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm tryin' to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know


All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit


This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear


All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit

My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to fuck tonight, you heard me?

There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing


Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands


Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy, Lord
The band kept us too busy we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band, Lord
They're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on
Keep on dancing thru the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing


Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands


Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

Said I'm done, I told you to get out
Didn't mean a word that I said
Cause I was hoping you would come back

And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
And I tried to fight and I cried to God
Oh please let it just work
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed, baby...

But you changed your mind
Too caught up in the streets
Boy, your truth is hard to believe
Why are you really scared of me?

And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
'Cause I put in mine and worked overtime

I'm the Cochise of the East Coast I blow on beats
I create in the coma state how I doze to sleep
I keep dozing but never doze six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me

I haze up 'fore haters hopin' I gave up
It's either you stay tough or you copin' to ?cage cuff?
From cold player to cold savor the hoes favor
Who's the most underrated, G Rap, AZ, or Jada?
Allah savior, bark but sharp as a razor
With street smarts in a Jedi heart like Darth Vader
Harsh behavior, puffin a Garcia Vega
The god see the haters but the larceny is greater
Pardon the player, I'm crunk with some defeats
But somehow somebody somewhere don't want me to eat
I'm one with the streets, I'm wanted and I'm comin' for keeps




And it's a must I live it, the trucks is kitted
Too many peoples in the penal so duck or visit
Show it off when I freestyle, who fuckin' with it
A final song for song as long as the hustlers get it
As long the jewels on all is custom fitted
Diamond cut for cut the cluster ups the digits
Enough is enough you can trust I hush the critics
Buck for buck, yeah I'm buckwild I must admit it

So prolific, so sincere, so gifted
So melodic, y'all got it so twisted

I put this moment... here
I put this moment... here
I put this moment
Over here!
Over here!


Can't you see where memories are kept bright?
Tripping on the water like a laughing girl
Time in her eyes is spawning past life
One with the ocean and the woman unfurled
Holding all the love that waits for you here
Catch us now for I am your future
A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land
Come over here to where When lingers
Waiting in this empty world
Waiting for Then, when the life spray cools
For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave
And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools
We are of the going water and the gone
We are of water in the holy land of water
And all that's to come runs in
With the thrust on the strand

I bet the women always wonder how I keep a man
They been trying for so long, and still don't understand
It's not the things I say, it's the way I say it
That keeps them locked down, nowhere to go
And on top of that, I let him know


I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You never have to worry 'bout a thing, I gotcha' back
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
'Cause it feels real good
When you know somebody's got ya' back


I'm the type when I find a man I like
It's on and poppin', ain't no stoppin', the things I do for you
No complications, baby keep it real
Do unto to me, as I do, and everything will be cool
When you find yourself in times of trouble
Remember that I'm by your side 
Lean on me, when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on


I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act
You never have to worry 'bout a thing, I gotcha' back
When no one else is there, with me you can chill
Because it feels real good
When you know somebody's gotcha' back

I'm down for whatever, no matter how you act

"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love

A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

Got ya car note in my cup, and your rent in my swisha

Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit

Me and Chainz go way back
We don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord




Name a nigga that want some

Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass
Take him out, bring em in, them whole things

The word 'Hurricane' is the name given to nature's strongest storm
A hurricane occurs when high pressure and low pressure masses of air
Come in contact with one another

There is often a significant difference in temperature
Between the two masses
One mass is warm, while the other is cold
The warmer air rises, and the cooler air falls
Likewise, the low pressure area slides down the sides
Of the high pressure area

They swirl in and around one another, creating the beginnings of the storm

They found him in the gutter at the business end of another Friday night
Someone who'd clearly been there before
I didn’t feel I had to ask him why
I have never understood why we need to know
The reasons for everyone else's strifes
Sometimes you don't need sympathy
To get the words right

Caught in anguish
He was
Sometimes that’s enough
And he was singing


Oh, looks like the end again
Her body bleachin' out into the waves
It's still the loudest thing
Oh, I wish I had all my friends
Somewhere drinking
The sunny afternoon
Into oblivion
But that's not your fault
How could that be my fault?


So we walked into a house party
Of someone, someone somehow knew all about
And all the young girls turned up late and drank us all to some kind of stand still
With looks of ""Heard it all before""
And distant ideas of death and thrills
And in absence, asked the host if he had any left
And somehow I did feel like yesterday was ours
But it's gone
Yesterday was ours
All along
And they were singing


Oh, looks like the end again
Her body bleaching out into the waves
It's still the loudest thing
Oh, I wish I had all my friends
Out there drinking the sunny afternoon
Into oblivion
But that's not your fault
How could that be your fault?

"Do you remember sunday nights, summer time at shoom

Joy big enough to fill the world, just inside that room

Do you remember friday nights at the hacienda?

Armistace for gangs, no fights, just beats to make the world surrender

Was it all a dream?

Was it some nightmare?

Crazy as it seems

Love was in the air

No war, no hate, no more

If you'd unlock the secrets of your

No war, no hate, no more

If you'd unlock the secrets of your heart

Day to day existence got it's gentle grip on you

Suffocating your soul, eclipsing everything you do


Everybody just looking for an answer

Everybody till the day they die

Everybody live with indecision

Everybody seek, everybody find

Everybody want to dance till sunrise

Everybody want to sweat some noise

Everybody want to kiss that dj

Every single girl, everysingle boy

Everybody got their own sweet wisdom

Everybody just a look to start

Everybody got it, inside their heart


No war, no hate, no more

Going crazy in this town

And don't get burned

I'll show you man who tread on glass

And he won't drop dead

Been a ju-ju boy for a thousand years
And he ain't cut yet

You've got to crease 'em and fold 'em
You've got to shape 'em and mould 'em
Take a piece of their soul, man
Well he can take a little moonlight
Suck the poison from a snakebite
Movin' round about midnight

See the sacrifice of the virgin women
See the deadly snake and the headless chicken
Take a sip from dripping red
Make it with the living dead

When you're sick he will come around
Takes his cures from out the ground
He's the one who can hypnotize
And you'll never believe your eyes

In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

In the book of love's own dream
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my lights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me

You
Flew
To me

In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me

Those sweet lips and eyes of green cut me like a blade of steel
Pull my heart like an eighteen wheel running up a Tennessee hill


I was a rolling stone, my feet never touch the ground
She was the only one that ever could tie me down


Feel like I left behind, trapped to an angel's wings
Bounded to a new born love, tied up in the apron strings
I used to live alone, never needed anyone

When you run across a woman
It's your true love that stronger than a moonshine buzz

All I know is we made love all over my place
And that's all I can remember but my condo give the play by play

Empty, obvious that something crazy here went on, sex was everywhere
Whipped cream all over the counter, but she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around but the only thing I found was


Lipstick on the glass
Cause we drank, got drunk, that night we lived it up
Yeah that night we did it up
And now the only trace I found was
Lipstick on the glass
Shot after shot we got hot, and we tore it up
Now all I got left is the

I should ask the neighbours, maybe they know
I know they heard us loving on the night before

I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
I got his homies screaming buck you need to calm down
Niggas be getting killed every time you come around
We ran up in his crib made his momma kiss the ground
She asking God, what my baby dunn did now?
I'm taking every thang, jewelry I want it all
Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waiting we can starting waiting on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow
I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fucking sidewalk
And I'ma be on CNN again it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga lef'
G-Unit soldier I'm thugging till my death mothafuckas
I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel

Baby, say goodnight
Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did when we was first dating


You're sittin' in your office, dreamin' of a different life
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now
We're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walkin' home from school
My thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight
And take off to a different place?
Don't tell my daddy why
Gotta get on that plane and just fly


Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris , we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris




I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find
We should go while we're young
'Cause one day, we will want to rewind


To our time in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris , make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night?
Promise we won't say goodbye


Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris , we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris




Walking through the streets at dawn
We dance by empty carousels
Singin' at the Sacré-Cœur
And climbing up the Tour Eiffel
Under the stars, we are, we are
Dreaming 


You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy


Take me to Paris 
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
It's Paris , make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night?
Promise we won't say goodbye

I live a chemical life
I'm on a mission to try
You went insane for a day
I'll have to shove it away
My only option is gone
Smile as they break and they fall
You want a simpler life
You can't erase what was mine


You must be out of your mind
This was a simple design
You fuck it up every time
How could you leave me behind


It's alright, it's alright
Because I know what you want
But you'll just have to wait
If I had it to give
I would give it away
I'm living it up
While I'm falling from grace
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away


I'm used to making it worse
Made up of four letter words
You want to know what it was
Now isolated and gone
You fall apart at the seams
I'll never know what it means
Try not to pull it apart
You're aiming straight for the heart






It had to be the worst for me
I don't know what to say so let me be
And now I find you left me behind
I don't know what to say so never mind!
You're mine!

I, am the mystery
And I, am the bringer of moonless night
Bear the wisdom arcane
I, harbinger from the burrowed isle


Once you break forth
Hearken the flap of my wings


Haunt your fears
Though you don't know of my duty to lead
Your path, because I'll take, you home
To rest in my black wings, enfolding you


I am the icon sublime
The guide on the voyage, clandestine
Sing the verses bewailed
I, torch of the radiant way


Once you step out
Hearken the strokes of my wings
Once you will leave your cocoon
I will be there


Haunt your fears
Though you don't know of my duty to lead
Your path, because I'll take, you home
To rest in my black wings, enfolding you


And death will smile his barefaced smile
Initiating your final anguish
It is not before my arrival
That you will be lead to feel the natural serenity of leaving this world...

Hear my wings caressing the wind
Hear my cry


Haunt your fears
Though you don't know of my duty to lead
Your path, because I'll take, you home
To rest in my black wings, enfolding you

Even the words that I write, refuse to fly
All that I can hear is your song haunting me
Can't get the melody out of my head you see
Distractions I've been using
Do you know how much you're losing?
No you don't, but I do

Is no word from you at all the best that you can do?

Can't tell me shit
When I'm with my crew
Swagger to the max

Can't tell me shit
When I'm with my crew
Swagger to the max
In my Lo Bootz


Photoshoot, 4-door coupe
Polo boots, turnt up through the roof
Me gon' hit my boots, then she hit my boots
Told her I was thirsty, she say ""she had that juicy""
She's willing and I'm able
I told her ""I'll see you later""
So many horses in my closet
Makes my shit look like a stable
Crib like a zoo, all types of gators
His and her, fox furs, all types of flavors
This is not a Boxster, this a Panamera
I've been serving dick,you can check my clientele
My wrist costs a bail, my charm costs a chicken
And every time you see me
You can tell I'm fucking getting it
I used to wear the skippers
I'm polo'd to the zipper
I used to shop at Macy's
When it used to be Riches 
I used to it and you useless
So know the fucking difference
And fuck with one of mine
Somebody gonna end up missing




I sag too low, lift them up let the boot show
Leather dark red, the same color as Nuvo
Wrist hugging that Hublot, my pockets huge though
Denim TRU clothes, get worn out like a used ho
Polo, high boo, like ""Hi boo""
Yeah I'm fly, cute in that hard top suicide coupe
Cannon on me while bumping that Trapavelli II
Slime Flu, coughing on niggas, must I remind you?
I'm used to this city noise, of pretty boys
Fatter that Diddy's boys, Magic City wit Tity Boi
Silly boy, I make classics, Reebok 54's
With my whole crew, lo boots, like give me 50 more
Conjure for Bonjour, whore
Hop out the four-door with four broads
Look like The Law
It may be Juicy Couture, I bag them all
I had a mall, swagger tall
And I just happen to ball




I dive in that wet, call me Micheal Phelps
Louis logo, check a boy's belt
501s, mind on my money
Look at the tongue, these boots looking like diamonds
Pockets on Goliath and your pockets on a diet
OK, alright I try it, if I like it then I'll buy it
Except for some pussy, OK you're right, I'm lying
Cause if that pussy good, Imma motherfucking buy it
And yeah I'm from the city where these bitches get tipsy
Niggas smoke strong, on the phone and talk riches
Righteous prices, baking soda vices
And yeah I'm in a new car, and I don't have a license

And every time she sees me, she calls me Ralph Lauren
Imma Ralph Lauren story, Ralph Lauren mansion
And when it gets cool
I wear my Ralph Lauren jacket

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven


Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder


There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking


Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder


And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter


If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on


And it makes me wonder
Ohhhh, woah


Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind




And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll


And she's buying a stairway to heaven

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wastin' time 
You know how I feel about waitin' in line 
You know he ain't it, girl, you're wastin' your time 
You're only this young for a moment in time, take it in stride 
How-how-how-how-how many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? How many times I gotta? 
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side
How many times?


How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell you I got a chauffeur?
Think about it, think it over
Everything is gon' be kosher
Call me when you gettin' closer
If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?
Don't send me no naked pictures
If I can't get naked with ya
This dick deserve recognition
I don't mind payin' that commission
Is you with the shit or nah?
If we ain't fuckin' then, bitch, bon voyage
How many times? I said how many times?
Too many times and bitch, I ain't got time


How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? 
I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wastin' time 
You know how I feel about waitin' in line 
You know he ain't it, girl, you're wastin' your time 
You're only this young for a moment in time, take it in stride 
How-how-how-how-how many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? How many times I gotta? 
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side
How many times?


Okay, phone off the hook, yeah, that bitch won't stop blinkin'
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring
You've been drinkin' and drinkin', you're drinkin' for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah, leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leavin'
Callin' shots, refereein', no drama
Pussy so wet, I'ma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy, I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodgin' the leeches, I'm signin' agreements
I'm signin' new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimmin' with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixin', this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up


How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side 
How many times?


Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down, oh, woah
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
In town, in town, for the weekend, oh
How many times?


I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, ""Bingo!"" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh
Another one


How-how-how-how-how many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? How many times I gotta? 

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?

I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side 
How many times?

Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm


First it was nothing, not even, a fake echo of a song
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes
Thought I'd never feel this way again
And you were supposed to reach my heart
And find love within, love, love


Love within a storm
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love
Love within a storm
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me
Love within a storm
Wonderful
Love within a storm


I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near
Any problems plaguing my mind, would suddenly dissapear
It was rebirth of my heart, the day that you became my friend
Because I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again
Fall in love again, in a storm


Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm


Just when I thought I'd seen it all
Our paths crossed, amen
And I knew, from the first glance
That you, would be hard to forget
Your eyes, attracted me first
But you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait, to touch lips
And kiss, with my heart's intention
When we did it, was what I expected
And for that moment, we erased the tension
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters
And the initial blind date, first impressions
We kissed again; and I felt the passion
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessing


We made love, within a storm
In the midst of passion and chaos
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this drama
Will learn to bring their love farther
But now, the storm has past
And the seas of our friendship are gone
But as long as I live, I will remember
The love within a storm


Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love
You know that I miss you, and love you
You know that 2Pac broke my heart
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice
They say, this ghetto fabulous
On 125th street forkin' around
This village, and the village uptown
South Central, Compton, Philly
Chi-Town, Southside
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta
Jersey peeps, I hear ya
Miami, South Beach, uh
Yeah, got love for you, love for you
My Brooklyn knights lovin' you, lovin' me
This open, rich city
Ya know, I got love for you

Went to buy me a paper at the local newsstand
And then I heard them laugh and say
""Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now
Hey, what's it good for anyway?""


So I said, ""Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may""


What about Livingstone?
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way?
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?
What about Livingstone?


And all of those fellas at the local newsstand
Didn't know what to answer or what to say
So I told them about him, that he was just like
One of those spacemen in his way


And if you laugh at them, then there's only a thing I can say


What about Livingstone?
What about all those men
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way?
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?

Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer

Wish I could stop by and maybe say ""hi""
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side

The tables have turned
And I've finally learned
That this is making up for every day I was gone
And that's why I'm concerned
But now it's confirmed
That you spread your wings and learned to fly but all alone


Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you
As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you
Long as I'm alive baby, I'd die for you, wanna be with you

While I'm paper chasin'
You were there when I said one day I'd get up out that basement
Playin' as my agent
For you there's no replacement
You will always be my girl, you can hold me on that statement


Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you
As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you
Long as I'm alive, baby, I'd die for you, wanna be with you

Baby, I know you and how we do
Doing exactly what I taught you
Gotta get that money first before you
Come spend that precious time with your boo
And know I gotta just take it
Even though it's drivin' me crazy
Always want to see my girl make it 


Wish I could keep you much longer
I know you gotta go 'cause you got things to do

Red lipstick, but let’s get realistic, you ain't Marilyn
The shade of red for every kind of man that you would call again
The prince is sitting on the castle of mirages 
In the bathroom, that’s where you make your collages
I’m the farthest reaching planet from the star where you are standing
That should be obvious, but dammit this ain't how I planned it
The hardest part of breaking up is first foot on the granite
So I'ma try and manage


Shallow nights, shallow days
Teach me how to live with all this poison under my veins
I’ve become the person that I hated the most when I was young


Black zipper pretty in the bed of a pickup truck
With a 40 of whatever like who gives a fuck 
When the lights are flashing and the city is like non-stop
And you’re driving back and forth like it was a pawn shop
I’ll be in the back of the bar taking shots to the head like ""OG"" Bach
Put another quarter in the juke 'cause I don’t wanna let this song stop
This goes out to the young hearts that aren’t right in some spots
That blow up like sun spots and leave you with blood clots
And to the dumb trots who think they can play my heart strings
I’m just gonna open up and let the dark sing


Shallow nights, shallow days
Teach me how to live with all this poison under my veins
I’ve become the person that I hated the most when I was young
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young


Slow down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Slow down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down


Shallow nights, shallow days
Teach me how to live with all this poison under my veins
I’ve become the person that I hated the most when I was young
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young

Yo daddy, these nigga's ain't hood, drop that shit


So what I grew up with them niggas, i ain't stuck with them niggas
We from the same hood but I don't fuck with them niggas
Shit pop off, I touch one of them niggas
Cut one of them niggas, buck one of them niggas
Beg For Mercy, number four, I'm so hood
First LP, ten-million sold, I'm so good
I thought niggas would love to see me shine
But it's making them sick to see me getting mine
Got that Benz, got that Bentley, and that new Bugatti
Got that Range, Aston Martin, and that new Ferrari
If it's making you sick to see me blow I'm sorry
Dude we used to be cool, but I ain't stuck with you nigga
I grew up with you nigga, but I don't fuck with you nigga
Got shot in the back then turned around and got shot in the eye
You ain't gonna shoot back lay down and die
There's a message in my music, can you hear it Kai?
Your man's never gonna blow and you're the reason why
It's disease infested when I spit it any nigga can get it
Fuck the fronting and the rhymes that ass'll get flat-lined
Can't we all just get along? we used to be friends
Nah, fuck that, man we used to pretend
These niggas is comedians, I thought I was type funny
Five called telling niggas, ""mutt need bail money""
On some real shit, would you bail a nigga out son, that knew niggas was trying to kill you and wouldn't let you hold a gun
Think about it
Hahaha


Regardless of what you done heard or hearing
Fuck all the comparing I dare them to come anywhere near him
They want someone famous to pout with so I walk around with my gun like it came with the outfit
I don't really like to toot my own horn but beep, click clack, blat, go to sleep
We all know since you was in the class with Legos, you'd grow up to be as soft as mash potatoes
Your man gonna make me throw this nigga towards the window and put his ass in the air like the Jordan symbol
All my diamonds are colored, I Fruity Pebble'd the right hand, fifty-five grand on the bezel from Ice Man
They want to give your boy the 40 cal and nina so I stay on my toes like a ballerina
I'm starving nigga, the only one that can cut me and get away with it is my barber, nigga
Cause I'll revolve a nigga, take a piece of your head
You'll have more room in your hat than a Harlem nigga
And now most of these subliminal raps be coming from the same niggas backstage giving you daps
Like, ""yo banks you hot and everybody says it and I think it'd be real big if we could do a record""
But now I'm on some other shit
Like I ain't fucking with none of you niggas on a record unless you my brother shit
I'm an intelligent man and my elegant band got more colors than elephant man
Since hell is at-hand I mine as well expand hand over my can
Tan all over the lamb, lamb all over the sand
The sun all over the beach, your eyes all over my bitch
Her eyes all on your moves incase one of them switch
If you don't learn to relax and swallow steam, there'll be more shells in the grass than halloween

Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid’st me come to Thee
O Lamb of God, I come! I come!
Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt;
Fightings and fears within without
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot
To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind;
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
Because Thy promise I believe
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

It's just me against the world
Me against the world, baby
I got nothin’ to lose
It's just me against the world

Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby



Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is out for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain’t no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they’re illin’
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin’
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I’m losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby



It's just me against the world

It's just me against the world

'Cause it's just me against the world, baby

Me against the world


Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall


Every day there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well



With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world

It's just me against the world, baby

I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world

It's just me against the world, baby
x2

Me against the world
x2



With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even a genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world



Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world

Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby



Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it
Yeah...ooh...

Me against the world, me against the world
Me against the world, me against the world
Me against the world

Perche non ho creduto mai

E' di giglio la tua purezza

Let's burn it fucking down
Yeah


Back from the dead to tell you that I'm alive
Killed the old way but I survived
Fuck the blueprint, I redesign
Death or exile, you decide
Tell 'em all that I made my name
Tell 'em all that I paved my way
Found the fear then went face to face
Now it's mine to send up in flames


'Cause this right here is as far as you go
This right here is where I lose control
This right here is as far as you go


Burn it all down, burn it all down
I don't give a fuck
Burn it all down, burn it to the ground
Feed the flames, go insane
And burn it all down, burn it all down
Fuck what they say, fuck everything
Light the match, gasoline
Kill it all, kill everything
And burn it all down, burn it all down


Nothin' but red inside when I close my eyes
Vision built that you can't deny
Born and bred to take back what's mine
Break or bow down, you decide
Tell 'em all that you can't be saved
Tell 'em all that you dug this grave
Learn to live in this mess you made
Now it's mine to send up in flames


'Cause this right here is as far as you go
This right here is the end of the road

Our souls are colliding instead of rising
Distracted from our passions to keep the world's statisfaction
Life purposes misplaced, you feeling worthless at your workplace
Caught in this foul traffic, lost in all this action
The daily disatisfaction
Caught in a race to embrace, and the only thing you worry 'bout is how much you getting paid
Try to fit in, always feel alone so you tryna get laid
Growing up in the spot where everything is scandalous
Constantly tried by phenomenon, can't get a handle of this
Minds trapped in the guillotine of reality, souls strangled
Overwhelmed to be in the center of the self, faces mangled
Struggling to be happy with all the weight, all the waiting
Seeking an escape from the cycle of the scandal
Reaching for a handle
Try to drown the sorrows in alcohol, but the motherfuckers learned to swim
Slipping, fall, missed your call, immerse yourself in sin
Lost in this time, this mindless of an existence, feeling like you can't win
Where they still judge you by the color of your skin
Land of sin

When my man leave the house, I know he's coming right back
I got that good good, I got that good good
No matter how much he might try to act, he know just where it's at

I put it on him right, I do it every night
I leave him sitting mouth open like whew
So I don't worry 'bout nobody taking mine

I ain't never had a problem with the one 
Never been worried bout him ever cheating on me
Cause when I say I got that pop lock and drop it believe me
If I'm with you, it's gon' kill you on the days you don't see me
See the things I possess, a lot of women don't 
And the things Ima do for mine, most won't

Ladies, don't believe half what you hear, 'cause it's all a waste of time
If you know you got that good, good good, everything will be just fine
So let your man be the man when he's in public 
Even though behind the scenes y'all be runnin 
Let him run with his boys, let him play his little games
Let him drive his Cadillac, don't worry he'll be back

If you got that good good and you know it, ladies show him where's it at 
Where it's at 
See, I don't know what them other girls be doing, they be crying 'bout they man
Cause they always losing
They need that 
Gotta have that  to keep him 
You need that

I dont really wanna ride with ya, girl I just wanna be ya side nigga
Know you want a ride or die nigga, but its never hoes over my niggas, never hoes over my niggas, yeah its never hoes over my niggas
All they ever do is lie niggas, but I won't let em get me, im on 50 til i die nigga
Ain't no need for me to lie nigga, I ain't wasting no more time wit em
Fuck em once then im dodging em
Say you getting all this guap nigga, but we know that thats a lie nigga
Four fingers, fucking five bitches, I just wanna be the side nigga



All day, all my niggas rocking dog chains
I been killing shit since i was 14
Tell the plug that i need the whole thing
Fuck a little bit, the whole thing
Take the water liter, the whole thing
Think i need another pair of balmains
Told my niggas pull up and they all came
Time fly while im schemin
Popped a perk then i started tweakin
In a room full of temporary bitches that you probably neva even seen and
These niggas wanna give me reasons
Now im looking for a fucking reason
So i tell a bitch I'll be ya side nigga if you want ya nigga to be heated





I just wanna be the side nigga to my side bitch
I ain't really with that cuffing shit
I told that hoe just save that for the island
I can't focus on these bitches
Ima put my time and effort into grinding
Until i got a hunned mil up in a duffel and i flood it up with diamonds
And these niggas, they can't fuck with me
Hammer on me like its stuck with me
I got that purple if you fuck with lean
So dont come thru if you dont fuck with me
These bitches always fucking rushing me
You shouldve never put your trust in me
You shouldve never put your trust in me
I dont trust you so dont trust in me





I just wanna be the side nigga...
What the fuck you think i wanna be the main nigga..?
Nahh.. I just wanna be ya fucking side nigga.. Ahh

I just wanna be ya side nigga... Be inside of ya
Side nigga... I just wanna be the side nigga

Now you’re with a man that is gods worst sinner
Well no, don’t care about me
I was just the man meant to set you free

Make you a part of me

There is this something that I need to know
Why am I the only one that lost it all
But every day and every time I turn around
Searching for a place
That I have left behind
And all I wanna believe
That you could bleed so


Burn with me
I’m just an empty shell

Transformed to someone else
Take your seat
I cast a spell
So you’ll be less like you
And more like someone else

One life is another’s dream
What someone says a myth is one normality
How can I
Believe there’s another sun
Correct me if I’m wrong but I’m the chosen one
As night has taken what is left of day
And everything Is like it’s make of clay
I feel like I am the only one
Feeding my need to be reckoned as someone
And every day and every time I turn around
Searching for a sign so
I can make a sound
But all I want is to flee
I want to see you

Never thought it would come easy
Slow as turning soil
That’s the only way to reach me that much I am sure of
Bring it to a boil

Just take your time, thoroughly
Let the seasons be the air you
Breathe in and out
Patiently
Wait for spring’s returning


Try not to think too far ahead
The pendulum swings soon enough
We could stay on this side instead
But we wanna make it rough


There were times I thought I’d get there
I know you thought so too
The days have bled together
Now any day will do
If you’re looking I might have it
But you have to look to see
The image you have of me
Is what I’d like to be

I was so good at pretending
And denying when things bothered me
So shut the front door I’ll
Kick in the back
Metaphorically, I’m hoping




Make it rough ’til they put you in the handcuff
Seeking out minds that are not yet corrupt
Woi-oh woi-oh and away you go
I’m a go on til the god damn juice gone
Far enough into the journey to feel the satisfaction yes
Action speaking louder than bombs
We just go on and on, on and on, on and on and on

But every since you left, said goodbye

Check it
I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein' street
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggas in my box throwin suggestions
Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the resurrection
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writin niggas with stripes, I hold posture with
Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich
Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County
To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven
Why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell?

See the man run from his problems
See the man face down in a bottle
See the man realize old ghosts ride along
You can't drive when you're too damn stoned
See the man in a three piece suit
See the man in a Rolls-Royce car
You know that man's realized that he can't buy friends
But he buys all the drinks all night long



See the man goin' down in flames
It ain't about money, Lord, it ain't about fame
You see that man's goin' down on his knees
As he begs for one more please
Shoot 'em down
I didn't pull the trigger but I gave 'em the gun
One more round
In the chamber and it's done
If he could see
Oh, through these eyes I've seen
Then he'll put that bottle down
Stop drinkin' to the ground



See the man turnin' off the barlights
See the man thank God to see his home lights
You know that man's dead sober when he walks through the door
When you drink all alone you can drink 'till four
See the man pickin out a song
You see that man put the guitar down
You know that man's realized another day's passed by
But you can't find the bed when you're spinnin' around



See the man goin' down in flames
It ain't about money, Lord, it ain't about fame
You see that man's goin' down on his knees
As he begs for no more please
Shoot 'em down
It's time I pull the trigger 'till I empty the gun
No more rounds
In the chamber and it's done
Lord, I see
Oh, through these eyes I've seen
Go on and put that bottle down
And stop
Drinkin' to the ground





Shoot 'em down
Didn't pull the trigger but I gave him the gun
No more rounds
In the chamber then it's done

Oh, through these eyes I've seen
Go on and put that bottle down
And stop drinkin' to the ground

I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality

I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore


I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry

Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore


Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!


I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith

If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore


Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release

Caged without a key
Everyone comes to stare at me

Keeping me from flying
That's why I say that...

Only joy comes from song

Why not just set her free?


So she can fly, fly, fly
Spreading her wings and her song

I been rockin' mics since Sergio Valenti
Down for my people just like Kunta Kinte
Got more Boricua mommies than Tito Puente
My man 2Pac picked me up in the Bentley
You come from the East, come to speak peace
Come from the West, bring the Buddha bless
Come from the East, come to speak peace
Come from the West, bring the Buddha bless
It ain't no motherfuckin' hair off my chest
Time is hard, I rock a bullet proof vest
Met so many yes men, so many yes
They try to gas my head like Hess
The heavenly father put me to the test
Divide and conquer what I do best
Ain't nothin' to it but alleviate stress

Ha ha ha ha shit, was it ever a war?

Only in your minds 
Today we sign the treaty EAST SIDE / WEST SIDE
All the real niggas ride, to pay these motherfuckers ,  
Nobody tryin' to be clashin' and shit
Motherfuckers tryin' to get their cash
That's why we mash in this bitch 
So I'ma just ride out on this motherfucker
Let my Oakland peeps let you bitch made niggas know how we roll

Fresh starts from burnt ends
My body can't stand strong, to reminisce is to give in
A hand in the present, a foot in the past
A thirst to move forward, but your demons keep holding us back


Melt away, become estranged
Waiting on a sign, a reason to remain
By your side, by your side


And I know that I can't hide behind words
Are you just being cruel to be cruel?
Blue was the color I thought I knew
But every kiss hits like a bullet, it pierces through
Sorrow like the lines on your palm, I stood by as it grew


Whispers in the attic
A green glow spills and colors this place
One step closer to the edge, nowhere feels safe
The mechanics of disdain will only fail you


And I know that I can't hide behind words
Are you just being cruel to be cruel?
Blue was the color I thought I knew
But every kiss hits like a bullet, it pierces through
Sorrow like the lines on your palm, I stood by as it grew


Crises of faith, I won't hide in the folds
Scratch at the walls to get to the core
Comes as you were, as I want you to be
Fire to the fall to get to the core

 
And I know that I can't hide behind words
Are you just being cruel to be cruel?
Blue was the color I thought I knew
But every kiss hits like a bullet, it pierces through
Sorrow like the lines on your palm, I stood by as it grew

We're still delivering ten thousand souls a day
And disproportionately packing them away

The starving of the multitudes and the feeding of the few
We're only humanoid there's nothing we can do
You must do something or we'll all go up in smoke
We'd like to help but we're afraid of losing votes

We're not progressing we're only marking time
You're on your own

Then California would be sucked into the drink
You've all got bodies and a few of you got minds
We'd like to juse them but we never get the time

Though man's achievements are a credit to us all
How come we're stading with our backs against the wall?
One thousand congressmen assemble every day
They'll send us packing on a dreadlock holiday

They'll never listen to you
They'll never listen to your cries
They'll keep on talking and wasting precious time

They dance in my dreams while I scream out in pain

This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay

Alone, awake with the craving
I watch my step, I'm calculating
On how I'm taking this motherfucker down, down, down, down, down
I don't know what I am thinking
Sometimes I feel like I am sinking
Into the ground I'll call my grave

Holding on to misty memories
Chasing shadows through the night
Trying to find my happy ending


Reaching out for another chance at heaven
We could still find a way if we try

We were more than lonely drifters in the dark
I can remember the sun inside
Love held us tight
I need to feel your magic here tonight
Instead of it tearing apart


Diamonds shining in the night
Lying soft and warm together
Only images survive
Can't my dreams go on forever?


Oh, there's still time to lock away your sadness
Let the secrets of love start to smile


Baby, believe in the mystery

Baby, bring back all the passion to my heart
I can remember the tender days
All the love we made
Can't you see in me your magic here tonight?


Lonely spirits seem to whisper in the wind
It's a silent song that's never meant to be
Since the dawn of time, the mystery never ends
We could find forever if we let love rise again


Tell me why can't we reach for another chance at heaven
We can still find the way if you try

It's easier to hold some, when no one's in the way
Well if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
To show you the main room 
I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space
Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days
I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye
Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm

It's too many ifs and maybes, and not enough certainty
Well if no one's putting numbers on the board
I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you
But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind
Take a look at that moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes
We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline
Take a puff of that, get a sip of this wine

She had this Asian swagger ‘bout her, so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to
But I'ma have to put in work, baby girl then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long
She come and see me, but she don't stay long
And that's the problem, she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'mma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter

So that must mean I want you
You're unavailable and disinterested
To you I look for comfort
A million times in a million ways
I will try to change you
A million months and a million days
I'll try to convince you


I have waited for you
And adjusted for you
And I am done
I have deferred to you
And enabled you
And I am done


You're too young or you're too old
Or you're simply not inclined
You're asleep or you're withholding
Be that my cue to crave you
Several times in several ways
I'll try to squeeze love from you
Several hours and several ways
I'll feast on scraps thrown from you


I have bent for you
And I've deprived for you
And I am done
I have depressed for you
And contorted for you
And I am done
I have stifled for you
And I've compromised for you
And I am done
I have silenced for you
And sacrificed for you
And I am done


It won't be long before I am reclaimed and
It won't take long and I'll be on path again
It won't be easy for us to disengage and
I'm at the end of self-deprivation stage


You're afraid of every woman
Afraid of your inner workings
You cringe at the thought of living under
The same roof as me, God and everything
A million times and a million ways
I've tried to alter to match you
Several times every several days
I've tried to uncrush on you


I have waited for you
And adjusted for you
And I am done
I have deferred to you
And enabled you

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease

Let all within us praise His holy name

"Where is the love that you promised neath the pine
Gone like the flowers in the fall
You crossed your heart now you're double crossing mine
You've been petending after all

I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

I never dreamed that your love would grow so cold
Hiding behind the rainbow's end
You must be blind for the glitter of the gold
Gold that can never find a friend

Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

You'll never know what it means to sit and cry
After your heart is broken too
Someday you'll learn and your soul will burn and die

In this world of heartache

The only sin in this world unjust

Where passions erupt
And end abrupt it's a crime
With no great gestures cry
Its eyes, with no great evils shine

Here among all the vicious beasts
With their blood lust feast
Ordained by black priests

Here among the poison viper's bite
A police gunfight
In the unknown night is a man
With no great master plan
No deadly weapon clutching in his hand

Where loves disgraceful

Crimes committed with sharpened knives
And wasted lives
Of those who are forced to shove
And murder the peace dove
There is no higher calling from above

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb ass hemp be
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining looking like I robbed Liberace

Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a westside playa where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballies 
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program
Worldwide et 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sacktown, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down, give me love!

You are the bravest man I’ve ever met
You unreluctant at treacherous ledge
You are the sexiest man I’ve ever been with
You, never hotter than with armor spent
When you do what you do to provide
How you land in the soft as you fortify


This is in praise of the vulnerable man
Why won’t you lead the rest of your cavalry home


You, with your eyes mix strength with abandon
You with your new kind of heroism
And I bow and I bow down to you
To the grace that it takes to melt on through


This is in praise of the vulnerable man
Why won’t you lead the rest of your cavalry home
This is a thank you for letting me in
Indeed in praise of the vulnerable man


You are the greatest man I’ve ever met
You the stealth setter of new precedents
And I vow and I vow to be true
And I vow and I vow to not take advantage

I had a dream last night
I was floating down that black water
Kick back on the Mississippi
On a raft with ol' Tom Sawyer
He got restless down around Memphis
That's where he left me
Said, I'm one rambling man
I was gone before you met me


And there I was back in my hometown
That's just how dreams go
Thumb in the air, wanted out of there
Had my eye on the road
Well I hitched a ride with this beatnik guy
Said, looks like you read me
My name is Jack Kerouac
I was gone before you met me


You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
Your fix that roof, put your roots in the ground-boys
Pink house, the white fence
Pretty little woman, two point five kids
Dang right, it's a good life
But boys like me are born to run the wild side
Like the restless wind you'll never catch me
I was gone before you met me


And just before I awoke
I had a bad nightmare
I was on some lost highway and you were nowhere near
Someone took your hand I wasn't that man
Girl, it sure did hit me
I was cussing fate but it was too late
You were gone before you met me
Yeah, I smelled that coffee
I heard you singing in the kitchen
Walking in got a kiss, you said the sink’s still dripping
Thank God I'm still driven


You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
You fix that sink, put your roots in the ground-boys
Blue house, the white fence
Sweet little woman, rocking that goodness
Dang right, it's a fine life
This restless heart found a heart I can call mine
I was smart enough to let love catch me


So Tom and Jack just ramble on without me
'Cause I was gone before you met me
Gone gone, gone before you met me
Gone before you met me

I wanna start a revolution
A type of personal solution

It's all about the execution

Open your mouth, open it wide

Get on the floor, just let it drop
Don't it feel good, don't it feel hot?
Feel the fire within


I wanna see you strut 
Come on walk for me

Everybody's looking for some love
But they don't know
How to let it all hang out
And that's why they're solo 
Don't wanna be solo

And now we're in a situation

And get yourself some validation

Now for a basic fact like that, you'll need no clue

Oh mother, sweet Caroline
Feels like you shot me with a .38 or a .45
And my heart's bleeding, baby
Can't feel my legs I'm paralyzed
I know you just in it for the moment, so I'll enjoy the ride


Eyes start rolling in back of my head, girl, I'm already gone
I can see all of nothin', what's happenin'?
Can't even look at your face, girl, I'm fadin' away
Girl, your drug is automatic


Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life

You're my sweet Caroline , my sweet Caroline


Ooh, baby, I'm down
As long as you do the same, I'll try the same shit right now, right now
Baby, tell me when you start to feel it 
Got me dead, oh , yeah, baby 
Just let go of all the emotion, all the emotion
Just let it out, fly with me

Breezy, let me make sure Caroline understands somethin'


Here I go, when I step up in the spot like another block
When the nigga drop stop, you ain't even got a clue
Regularly, man, a nigga that need to be seen
Medically, tell me what you really wanna do
Generally, niggas think they better than me, boo
Niggas really tryna put they foot up in my shoe
That's when I make a panic, I don't really understand it
That's when I lay 'em down, they tryna get a better view
Genuinely see the way I regularly choose
Whack niggas switch, I'm up to legendary view
Somethin' from benal, they already really knew
Instead of tryna fuck you, need to get a better crew
Lactose, switch, I came up back close
Better know I back those, I don't wanna let it go 
Damn folks, shawty wanna stand close
When a nigga bang those panties, and I let it blow 
He didn't really wanna do it
Then what it gets a nigga that be flowin' like a fluid
And I be damagin' everything every time a nigga get up on it, it's nothin'
We know that they already do it and ain't nothin' really to it
Pull up, stop, how 'bout a drop top?
Then I'm unlocked, I got my Glock cocked
That's how we do it over here
Do not hop on the mic on a wrong block, not
Y'all niggas know what it is
Yeah, you know the way I put it down for 'em
That's right, got 'em loose
Ain't no buggin', baby girl, you can see the grab on 'em
Now y'all don't really want to get a better blow
Fireworks nigga, now we givin' 'em a show
Let me chill, at the party, I met a pretty little ho
Make it bounce for me, but a nigga gotta go

Staring at the ground in a lucid light

Running round my head in a holy fire
Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
Freshen up the air underneath the streets
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide


And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy


'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
High on humans
I'm getting high, getting high

Elevate the headstrong dead long halo
Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
I can make your day glow sun to rainbow
Colour in your step, let me lose your mind
Animate the air with a stone cold question
Do you have the time? 
Do you hate your life?
Now I'm locking eyes  with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide

And then I found out how hard it is to really change
Even hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
Sorrow is there when you come back down
Funny thing is, all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends I have, the music I make, with the love I feel
I just had to start again


The days are a deathwish
A witch hunt for an exit
I am powerless
The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless
Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die
I can't fear death, no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell


Throw me to the flames!
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze!
Watch me burn


How are we on a scale of one to ten?
Could you tell me what you see?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
Have you been skipping meals?

Two more shots then I'm out, blacka, blacka then I reload
Got it, might earn 20 more, get yo' ass up on that pole
Damn, look at Lakeisha gettin' that money just like a zesta

The sun shone high those few summer days
Left us in a song, wide-eyed haze
It shone like gold
It shone like gold
But just as the moon it shines straight
So dawn goes down today
No gold can stay

What if a hard work ends in despair?
What if the road won't take me there?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold
What if to love and be loved is not enough?
What if I fall and can't bear to get up?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold
We could stay gold


We're on our way through rugged land
Top of that mountain we wanted to stand
With hearts of gold
With hearts of gold
But there is only forward, no other way
Tomorrow was your hope at the end of the day
And gold turns grey
And gold turns grey


What if a hard work ends in despair?
What if the road won't take me there?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold

Losing wouldn't be so bad at all
But I'm always on a mountain when I fall

Carved in cursive with a table fork
Muddy hymnals and some boot marks where you'd been

The shaking preacher told the captain's man
The righteous suffer in a fallen land
Then pulled the shade to keep the crowd from peeking in

We found your children by the tavern door
With wooden buttons and an apple core
Playing house and telling everyone you'd drowned

The begging choir told the captain's man
We all assume the worst the best we can
And for a round or two they gladly drag you down

We found you sleeping by your lover's stone
A ream of paper and a telephone
A broken bow across a long lost violin

Your lover's angel told the captain's man
It never ends the way we had it planned
And kissed her palm and placed it on your dreaming head

If you see God first, tell him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you representin' the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught up in the whirlwind
The other day I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read ""was the last of G's""
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed

All the years took half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die, will they all shed tears?
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear

Behind me, life without my 9, I'd rather do the time
See, I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
 and all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail?
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'

I'm so glad to have you back within these arms of mine
I can finally go to sleep and get some rest
Never once did I think of finding someone new
'Cause there's nothing better, once you've had the best
You're the very thing they sing about in love songs
And one mistake don't mean you've failed the test
As I lay beside you softly sleeping this I know
There's nothing better, once you've had the best


Within your arms, I've had the best
And I think the world should know
I don't care what you've said or done
I'll always love you so
You've got more love in your little finger, than all the rest
And there's nothing better, once you've had the best


No there's nothing better, once you've had the best

Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way

You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame

Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock
Till pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game, to me you're all the same
You're guilty


You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame

Well, you told me your whole life story in a few shorts
All the while I never knew the tone of your voice
A half an hour, I ramble on way too much 
Alone with my own thoughts 
 Enough is enough


There's a plain way to call it, but it's never that obvious for me
I'm in a communion, I got needs
The combination of all my life's complaints and a few strong drinks

No shine, no sunlight, just cold and grey
There’s no way to rise from beneath your wings
Chained to your side, I can never leave


You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me

You’re dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
Shadow maker, over my head, over my head


Everything is so empty, no glass half full
How can someone so beautiful be so miserable?
I’d follow you down to the edges of earth
Just to hear you say that your life is cursed


You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me

Better get away from Oxford Town

One more wrong will keep us one more night
When quiet fades at the light of day
I see the truth it's on your face again

When morning breaks my heart won't understand
Spend a lifetime raising houses on the sand

"Forget about the cash, in God we trust

Verse 1:
Most are concerned with the cheddar flow, but dawg I gotta let them know
A lot of reasons we should be seeking Jesus instead of dough
Instead of mo material things, the jewelry and fame
I speak of the King, but most ain't feeling me main
They would rather let they money stack, trying to get a hundred stack
They pockets fat, but they not ready when Christ is coming back
If they only knew the real truth about the coming wrath
They would probably race to Him faster than a running back
I know the things the cheddar buys, will attract and catch the eyes
Instead of ice, it'd be nice, if we would invest in life
Instead of all that flashy stuff, trying to get our status up
His wrath is just, so if we don't seek Him dawg then we out of luck
What good is it to gain the world and in the end lose your soul?
Its foolish bro, there's a loving Savior you can truly know
I know you seeking satisfaction, you can't find it though
Trying to dash for the cash and designer clothes

Hook:
Forget about the cash, Forget about the clothes
Forget about the stash, Forget about the dough
Forget about the cars, Forget about the rims
Forget about the stars, Forget about the benz
Forget about the big crib, trying to get rich, the big 64 plenty dough and trying to sip chrys
Forget the cash and chains, that stuff will pass away
And you can't take it with you to your after days

Verse 2:
Got money, got whips, got ice
Still broke homeboy! No Christ
Got a debt to pay, some real heavy wages
And the payment for his sin is pretty outrageous
I seen him park the car, suicide doors
Without Christ he walking through a suicide door
The dollar bill say in God we trust
Its funny cause money is the only god we trust
She say that she a Christian, but I can't tell
She ain't depending on God, she depend on mail
1 stack, 2 stack, 3 stack, 4
They spent they whole life stacking up dough
And when they die not a dimes gon go
Now they physically rich, but they spiritually poor
And they probably never heard of 1 Corinthians chapter 4
Cause they said they can't imagine God's people being poor

I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, I rep Christ til I D-I-E
I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith
I serve a God who is extremely great, I'm fanatic

Verse 3:
You can't serve God and cash, can't love the world and Christ
Put the money out ya mind, focus on eternal life
I can't speak from experience, I ain't seen it but I'm betting
Treasures of this world ain't nothing next to the ones that's up in Heaven
Feel free to store them up, since we found the Lord is just
Amazing let us praise Him main and try to give Him more of us
Let us live our lives with Him, spend our days and nights with Him
Ignore the trash the world has to offer and delight in Him

I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin' Alize and Cristal, whylin' every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or ho'
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home

Born through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin' you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin' and talkin', a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin' hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home


Ha..ppy.. home..

Ha..ppy.. home..

Ha..ppy.. home..

All these problems got me goin
We got a family, of our own

Rebel ... rebel
Rebel
Rebel ... rebel


They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
From a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain
So with a little bass and treble
Hey mister, it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC
They won't be happy 'til I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face
Pump up the bass, and join the human race
I throw peace to The Bay
Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground


Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground


Now I'm face to face with the devils
Cause they breedin' more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
Shit, it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin' 'em up once mo'
Now the fox is in the henhouse
Creepin' up on your daughter while you sleep I got her sneakin' out
2Pac ain't nothin' nice, I'll be nothin' how I wanna
And doin' what I'm gonna
Now I'm up to no good
The mastermind of mischief movin' more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel - the rebel of the underground


Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground


They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel - the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
Cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout
So what's wrong with the media today
Got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm comin' from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So, yo, to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin' records 'bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalypse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground


2Pac is a rebel
Rebel of the underground

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is powerful
Confusing what is real


There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface

Consuming 
Confusing 

This lack of self control, I find so overwhelming

Controlling 
I can't seem


To find the strength within, my walls are closing in

I've felt this way before, so insecure


Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is powerful
Confusing what is real


This comfort endlessly has made itself upon me

Distracting 
Reacting

Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection

It's haunting 
How I can't seem


To find the strength within, my walls are closing in

I've felt this way before, so insecure

And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

E da qui ti sento e dove vai lo so
E potrei alzarmi, ma non ti fermera nessuno
Ti conosco bene, sai, se vuoi andare vai
Tanto ritornerai...

Senza far rumore prendi le cose tue
Ma mi lasci tutto, quello e' bello in due
Il tuo primo bacio, per cui ti sei venduta il cuore
Ti conosci bene, sai, se vuoi andare vai
Tanto ritornerai...

You look at me like I’m a revelation
You wanna know if I can bring salvation
You saw a sinner, saw a saint inside of me
You wanna know if I’m a friend or an enemy

I found peace in a purple haze
My angels and my demons
They don’t know their place
Ready or not, they’re gonna come out and play


I can be your heavenly or I can be your hell
I can say a prayer for you or I can cast a spell
I push you to the darkness just to pull you to the light
Cause I can take away your breath or I can bring you back to life
Half God, Half Devil
Half God, Half Devil
Half God, Half Devil

I won’t pretend that I resist temptation
I think it’s funny when you preach damnation
I’ve been to hell and back and now it’s just a part of me
Without the darkness there’d be no light in me

Don't get me started on what it means to be alive
You're lying to yourself but then still you act surprised
Cause you're scared, can't come to terms with what you are
The wolves in sheep's clothing will only lead you so far


You'll wait and they'll go, cause in the end we all end up alone
So just wait you'll know


Forget everything just for tonight, we'll sing like everyone when they're alone
Cause I've been waiting for the night to say


I rely on myself, just making sure that was clear
I'm not in need of your crutches I faced all my fears
And I won, well
I knew I could have, life is not a punch card, make the best of what you have


Don't wait, just go, and when you find yourself please let me know
It's not too late, just let go


Forget everything just for tonight
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
Cause I've been waiting for the night to say

We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once we're doing something right when we say, 


In the end it's not about what you have
In the end, it's all about where you want to go
And the roads you take to help you get there
I hope you think that's fair
Cause you've only got one life to lead
So don't take for granted those little things
Those little things are all that we have

Getting high on humans


Sitting in the next seat, dead heat summer
Staring at the ground in a lucid light
I can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
Running round my head in a holy fire
Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
Freshen up the air underneath the streets
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide

Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind

Animate the air with a stone cold question
Do you have the time? Do you hate your life?

Turn it up loud
Sucker for love, sucker for love

Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
Sucker for love


I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be, you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...



Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me, say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it
But in this case, what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep it goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head, I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You're gettin’ calls at the house, guess you're cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...



Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you, a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it, now I’m under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice


I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said
""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""


To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut


I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" he said
""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""
Ay, back home


When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me


Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" I said
""You can keep my things, they've come to take me home""

Oh wait, that's right, forgive me, I invited you here
Now take a seat, I’ve got something to tell you


Sweetheart, remember me?
I'm more than just a memory
You've drained all my energy
And I don't know how to let it be
Same old song, I guess it's just a new genre
They don't know that I created all this drama
'Lord, save my soul' but I know I don't believe it
I should say no more, I found a lady for the evening
And she's got many faces and she's got many names
Just like the Mona Lisa, cause they all look the same
You're my imagination, allow me to explain
Welcome to my addiction
Sweetheart, this isn't me
I need a dose of reality
Don't know what's gotten into me
Feel like I'm running from the enemy


You and I, it's a suicide
This is do or die, if I don't do it right
And I know what I should do about it
But I don't know if I can do without it
You and I, it's a suicide
It’s a do or die, if I don't do it right
And I know what I should do about it
I'ma have to do without it


Too often I am caught in my own head
Wondering if tonight I'll share my bed
Cool and calm on the outside, but shook to the core
Being devoured by lions, you can tell by the roar
But this can't be life, this can't be love
I desired the pigeon and set free the dove
Things move too fast when egos get hurt
And bad seeds are planted when we dig in the dirt
So, I toss the shackles to the side, but they find their way back
Not this time satan, I can't go for that
I'd be lying if I said the devil made me do it
But that path is the one that leads to ruin
My actions, my words they gon’ paint a new picture
Take her off the wall... She's out my life and I don't miss her
It's clear my time is now, the battle will be won
Turn my back to the darkness it’s time to face the Son


You and I, it's a suicide
This is do or die, if I don't do it right
And I know what I should do about it
But I don't know if I can do without it
You and I, it's a suicide
It’s a do or die, if I don't do it right
And I know what I should do about it
I'ma have to do without it


Sweetheart, remember me?
I’m on the road to recovery
The Lord has forgiven me
Your slave ain't what I wanna be
I sang along, but now it's time to go solo
Play no more, I left the game like Tony Romo
I'm so sure that you're going to leave my head soon
All Amour, I want the love before the bedroom


Honey, can you look at your Daddy please?
First of all, I love you little bunny, you know that right?
Yes Daddy
Good, You see angel, everyday I work hard to be the type of man that you can look up to and be proud of
Because one day, you’re going to meet the man that you want to marry
And he ain’t gon’ be perfect, just like me!
But as long as he loves you unconditionally and puts the Lord first, you’ve found yourself a great man

I'm sitting here wishing for something that's missing
I'm waiting for you to tell me
That time keeps on passing
I'm hoping, I'm asking
To stand by your side
At least for tonight


Let's follow through with this reckless dream
That's tearing me up inside
And all the time we've been so innocent

So don't you go
I've got you where I want you and I'm never letting go
Hit the lights, we'll be alright
Tonight our dreams come true


Now lets take a chance here
Please give me an answer
It's all up to you so please take me away
You've waited for so long
I can't say it feels wrong to close my eyes
When all I see is you


Let's follow through with this reckless dream
That's tearing me up inside
And all the time we'll make it seem
Like we've got nothing to hide
Nothing to hide

So don't you go
I've got you where I want you and I'm never letting go
Hit the lights, we'll be alright
Tonight our dreams come true

Don't you go
I've got you where; want you and I'm never letting go
Hit the lights, we'll be alright
Tonight our dreams come true

So don't you go
I've got you where I want you and I'm never letting go
Hit the lights, we'll be alright
Tonight our dreams come true

Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin


Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up


Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter


Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up


Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter


And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up

"The First Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a king was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took it rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in his presence
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made heaven and earth of naught
And with his blood mankind hath bought

Holds more rank than a love letter from any super star

"Outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall
There's a chill in the air and the howl of a wolf while the rain beats at the door
Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high
And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry

When the dawn of a new day will see the light then the strongest hearts grow old
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead
In the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one heard what once was said
And the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold
When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold

When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

Dark night on the valley below still the horsemen follow through
It's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds
Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies
And the shadows of the night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone

When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

For lost souls will live on forever...

You think you know what the hell I've seen
You think you know where the hell I've been
I'm from the places people never really talk about
'Cause they don't even know where to begin
The mom and dad that I never had
Were just the first of the MIA
Had the teachers and the preachers and the coaches and counselors
But everybody faded away

Fake it sympathy, you don't care
Yeah there's hell on earth, I live there


You can take me to the devil's house
You can show me where the devil waits
So let me in, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates


Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything
I'm not tired
Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me
If this is hell, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates
And push me in the fire


When you said that you loved me too
You didn't get what it really meant
Can't lie and cheat and steal and leave
And think you're ever gonna see me again

Take it out on me, your M.O
Left in hell on earth, all alone


You can take me to the killing fields
And you can show me where the devil waits
So let me in, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates


Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything
I'm not tired
Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me
If this is hell, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates
And push me in the fire


I've got this feeling
Like I'm coming undone
I don't know where it's from
But I know that I like it
I've got this feeling
Like I'm coming undone
I don't know where it's from
But I know that I like it


Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything

To St. Louis, Missouri

For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want

Gave birth to my brother
Then all of the pressure
Made 'em fight one another

As a kid I never knew
I'd have to hustle just to make it through
So I found myself skipping school
Cause the girls don't think I'm cool
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause that's all I ever knew
Telling me I need to slow down
Cause everybody in the whole town
Cause they know how I get down
Foreigner from another town
Can you believe we still around?
After so many hit the ground
And we ain't gone stop now
Until we get that

Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, from all your misery
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, with plenty money
Put your hands up, put your hands up

Like a voice that commands
Rain drops fall
Like the blood from your hands

Pray to god
But I doubt that he's listening
This world is a gutter
That he likes to piss in

Tonight 

Millions of people
Quietly sleep
Dreaming of deserts
As the puddles grow deep
Dark clouds of rage
Black out the sun
The rivers will run
Red with their blood

No place left dry
No place of shelter for which to run
People muddle in mass
Waiting for the storm to pass
But it's just begun

Millions of people
All of you people
Dream of the sandman
But the sandman has turned to mud
Rain falling down
Is this another great flood?
The rivers are running

"Part 1: ""Breathing Infinity""

Chasing, chasing your shadow
Wasting, wasting the battle
Changing, changing the channel
Now all the fuss is just
Faith without the rush
Remember what it felt like to believe?
Remember running wild and living free?
Remember when the magic was a mystery?
Now all the fuss is just
Faith without the rush

Wait!
Did the rainbow fade?
We won't see beyond our feet
Staring down afraid to leap

Go!
Jump into the wonder
Dance on the thunder
Crying in color
Breathing infinity
Flying free

Stalling, stalling for nothing
Starving, starving from judging
Talking, talking but what if
All the talk is just
Truth without the walk
Remember what it felt like to believe?
Remember running wild and living free?
Remember when the magic was a mystery?
Now all the the talk is just
Truth without the walk

Wait!
Did the rainbow fade?
We won’t see beyond our feet
Staring down afraid to leap
Dive beyond the wildest dreams
Dare to wake up and believe

Go!
Jump into the wonder
Dance on the thunder
Crying in color
Breathing infinity
Flying free

Part 2: ""Jumping from Jaded Heights""

Waking up to face the haze of apathy
Show me every grace I lost the fight to see
I'm coming around
Remedy the piece of faith that broke in me
Take away the weight and flip the gravity
I'm leaving the ground

Oh! Jumping from jaded heights
I see a rainbow
Off in a distant sky
You set a table
I need to taste again
Savor and tremble
Take me to where you are
Burn in me!
Burn in me!

I know where I'm going

Hey!
Come, we're casting away!
Into the night
Sinners with sight
On to the light!
Soaring! Sailing!
On to the dawn, forever free
Where the heavens bend and bleed
Where the saints and angels sing

"Yeah! ha ha yeah.... thats right!
The F.A's comin striaght from the wild wild west

Look at baby girl born in 19-7-deuce
Pop's on his fix, Mom's stuck on that crazy juice
Went to school, It's all cool but in Junior Hiiigh
Little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
What she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
Is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
A bad ass broad running with the girl gang
Just got some tat's,Talking all that girl slang
First one to slap, because La vida dont matter
Wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
Selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
Beating up fools with a baseball bat
Started having sex at only 14
Imagine O.G. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
Got pregnant had a baby in December
She won't see the daddy till next September
Mom's and Pop's gave her the boot
Kicked her out La Casa, Now what Raza
With the money she got, She bought a spot of the block
Started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
Now shes 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
And plus shes all smoked out,the base face
You could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
Of a life long cries
They was headed for self destruction
Conjunction Junction, Whats your Function?
Her own kids gotta healp, 'cause they knew she was slippin'
Took the devil away homegiiirl, You was Slippin'

CHORUS:
Slipping into Darkness
When you slip you trip and fall
Slipping into Darkness
Ain't no sense to give ya'll no love at all

They say we're slipping, as a whole one race
So, what we gonna choose, Don't want the blues
I turn to the news and what do I see
""Everybody in the world ready to D. I. E.""
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites,from governments to undergrounds
So, Peep the sound as it bumps through your stereo
Ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
Cali got quakes, Mudslides, and Floods
PesadillasCrips and Bloods
Hustlas, Pimps, Shot Callers, and Killas
O.G. , Macks, and the big Coca Dealers
We got homeboys who just like kicking it
And Vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it
 ""You're in for a phat treat trip into a phat beat""
So get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat

CHORUS X2

They wanna band me cause a brothas makin noise a lot
Ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poisin dart
They got me runnin down the street gettin hotter
Runnin from the cops as i try to clock my Glock
The war won't stop
Thats why they wanna band the music
You ever notcie how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin wit a mexican
We can all have peace, the sun sets again
They try to shove us in the pen
But we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
Once again, its your friend outta oakland,hopin
To keep the hip hop clubs open
Now we can lay back and let them close'm
Or we can have beef and show that we control'em
Now ain't nobody gettin paid, its a damn shame
Why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
They say securitys to blame, cause they lettin it off
Brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
One time, make it worse when they sweat us
Send an army of pigs to come get us
Now im runnin outta time and im cool down with the aztecs
This is sorta like soul food

"You see me as a judge
Though I deny it
And hold me like a grudge
Then justify it

But when you take such pains
In searching for something that explains
Please, take a good look at our remains

Cause if you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And maybe there's room for compromise
But signs that I get say otherwise
Say anything, cause I've heard everything

As hopeless as it seems
I wouldn't worry
You'll get your chance to tell
Your side of the story

While you're raising your right hand
Whatever defenses you had planned
Remember that when you take the stand

If you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And though I'd be happy to believe
I'd have to be much more naive

Say anything, I've heard everything...

Now I've heard everything...

So why do I refuse
The truth, when I clearly cannot use
The comfort of one more lame excuse

Cause if you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And if you were everything you swear
We wouldn't be beyond repair
If you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And if there has got to be an if
Get it over with

Say anything, 'cause I've heard everything...

Now I've heard everything...

Tryna take her mind off the fallin' rain
I was sayin' anything to make her laugh
Never wanted anything so bad
She got me wishin' that she could stay
Doesn't even know that I missed my plane
Now there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade
For a ticket to L.A.


Now gate 22 is calling out her name
She wrote her number on my hand and walked away


Alone here in the middle of JFK
Sitting at a bar at an empty gate
I'd do anythin' to bring her back
Never wanted anything so bad
She got me wishin' that she could stay
Doesn't even know that I missed my plane
Now there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade
For a ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah
A ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah

I've found a new planet
That only I can see
Just came back to get you
Let's leave this misery
Nothing can reach us
So far from harm's way
Only sunshine
And rainbows every day
We've got to get back there
Hurry up and get your things
The countdown has started
Go ahead, try on these wings
Don't need no spaceship
For what I'm thinking of
Didn't I tell you
That I'd take you
To the planet of love
I got tired of losing
But now I'm in control
So help me start packing
We don't have far to go
I found a new planet
Don't revolve around the sun
We'll make a new start there
The journey's just begun
Won't get into trouble
In our new world so far above
Didn't I tell you
That I'd take you
To the planet of love
Didn't I tell you
That I'd take you

I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm
I'm just gonna walk home kicking stones at parked cars
But I had a great night, 'cause you kept rubbing against my arm
I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm


Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip, just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
My head's getting heavy, pressed against your arm
I adore you


All of my money is spent on these nights, just so we can hang out
Spacing in and out of your dresses, I wanna be found by you
Found by you


Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip, just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
My head's getting heavy, pressed against your arm
I adore you, I adore you


She kicks the gutter in tight shorts, basketball courts
Watch me, watch her talk to boys
I'm known as a right-hand slugger
Anybody else wanna touch my lover?


Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip, just so I can adore you

Money gone fuck friends, I need a homie that know me
When all these motherfuckin' cops be on me
I got problems, ain't nobody callin' back
Now what the fuck is happenin' with my ballin' cats?
Remember me? I'm your homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy, hangin' with the clowns, and all
We used to do is drink brew, screw and common knew
We had bitches by the dozens, we fuckin' cousins
You can throw your middle finger if you feel me, loc
A nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time, but finally the cash was mine
All the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around, and all I see is snakes and fakes
It's like scavengers, waitin' to take a hustler's place
And when you stuck, where the fuck is all your friends?
They straight busted and can't be trusted; fuck y'all!

‘Cause I'm a hopeless thug
Ain't no love reminiscin' on how close we was
Way back in the day, before they put the crack in the way
And heeyyy, how much money can you stack in a day?
It's gettin' rough, collect calls from my niggas in cuffs
I recollect we used to ball, now just living's enough
I stand tall in the winter, summer, spring or fall
""Thug For Life"" sprawled all across the wall
And all about my dollars make me wanna holla
Drop an album, sell a million, give a fuck about tomorrow
I know it's gettin' crazy after dark, these marks
Keep on huffin' and puffin', ain't no fear in my heart
What's goin' on in the ghetto? Still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater, smokin' chocolate thai
In '94, I'll be goin' solo
Too many problems of my own so I'm rollin' dolo; fuck all y'all!


Huh, pardon me!

I went from rags to riches
Quick to socializin' with the baddest bitches
Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' ""Gloriaaaa,"" doin' 90 ‘cause I wanna
I'm gettin' high, and like I said, it was some chocolate thai
Mixed with some Indonesia, watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Hit the weed and I continue doin' 90
Until I get caught, another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law, give a shit, I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I ain't worried, still throwin' these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey, nigga, what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout?
Soon as I hit the cell, I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets, I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screamin' ""Thug Life!"", nigga, fuck y'all!

Boy you forgot my style


Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think ''nigga better you than me''
.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet got no name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it
First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching
Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling ''drop it''
Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent
She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby
But he was outside talking to niggas crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
ROR, trust me nigga I know the law
Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste, I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
First law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying
Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures
Trying to come up, still eating around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky charms, stay armed, and niggas won't clap you then
We watch the side bitch talking like she his main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches acting up in here
Police they don't fucking care
Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us got to lose
Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on till niggas started attacking
Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing

When I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name
It's 50

I'm lost in empty pillow talk again
Lost in empty pillow talk again


This bed's an island made of feathered down
And I'm stuck here alone
Little else but memories of you on memory foam
Visions of a brighter love, I'd kill for one more day
To pool my thoughts and find the words to say


If these sheets were the states and you were miles away
I'd fold them end over end to bring you closer to me
Because I don't sleep at all without you pressed up against me
I settle for long distance calls
I'm lost in empty pillow talk again
I'm lost in empty pillow talk again


This room's become a mausoleum filled with relics of regret
Paying dues to every moment wasted on words left unsaid
Collisions of a finer love, I'd kill for one more way
To tell you how you make me better every day


If these sheets were the states and you were miles away
I'd fold them end over end to bring you closer to me
Because I don't sleep at all without you pressed up against me
I settle for long distance calls

Another year gone and lost and lately
I would die just to talk or maybe hold you for a day
It's not sunny like California
But the stories on every corner
Make the cold winds feel okay
Although I know that we've gone on alone and we're caught in the dark
I'm already thrilled just to be in the place where you are


I feel a little less lonely right away
Something in the air intoxicates
In your town
And even though the streets are filled with pain
There's a part of me that always wants to stay
In your town
And time stays frozen, all seems golden now


Going past old and new at break speed
Holding on tight while snapshots take me over
Turn the page
Wondering, do you know I'm here
Thinking I see you everywhere and nowhere
It's all the same
Although I know that we've gone on alone and we're caught in the dark
I'm already thrilled just to be in the place where you are

Take a look in the pool and what do you see?
In the dark depths there, faces beckoning me
Can't you see them?
It's plain for all to see
They were there, oh I know you don't believe me


Oh, I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane


I've no doubt that you think I'm off my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there, I don't know what to do


Oh, they drain my strength away
Oh, they're asking me to stay


Nightmares, spirits calling me
Nightmares, they won't leave me be


All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool


Now, I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear


Nightmares coming all the time
Nightmares will give me peace of mind


Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
Can't you see?
Not just me they want you too

And I am determined to go and see them, good Lord

If I could touch but just the hem of His garment, good Lord

She looked nothing like me, I think
But I wanted to call you and tell you about
The way that her hair got caught in her mouth
I saw the wing of a bird on the road
It was early, I was walking alone
And I found it lovely, and I found it sad

Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you


And at the bar, on TV
They were talking about the casualties
Four hundred and counting, and my only question
Was, ""How would you feel if one was me?""
Would you wish we'd made love again?
Would you want to revisit the marks on my skin?
'Cause the world could be burning, and all I'd be thinking
Is, ""How are you doing, baby?""

Much at all

How high must we climb

"We came from miles around
Just to listen to your sound
You made the night seem endless
You cast a magic spell
You played the part so well
Your music blew away the darkness
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
But we never took you for granted
Your lives were a blessing
But they carried a curse
The night that the stars didn't show
You made me stand so proud
I was lifted from the crowd
The fire inside me burning
The figure dressed in black
Sending shivers down my back
Deep inside my soul was stirring
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
The sweet inspiration that you gave us
And i can remember we didn't rehearse
The night that the stars didn't show
Mountains may crumble
And worlds fall apart
Lovers and friends may desert me
The road may be long
But i know in my heart
Your spirit will always be with me
The thrill to be up there
A sea of faces everywhere
I look i find you
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
But we never took you for granted
Your lives were a blessing
But they carried a curse

Bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
You better get your rifles boys before it's too late

Doin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump
He never been caught and he ain't never been treed some folks say looks a lot like me

Out the club about three, to the takeaway
The shit-in-a-tray merchants
Shop's got special perchant for the disorderly
Geezers looking ordinary and a few looking lairy
Chips fly 'round to the sound of the latest chart entry
An incendiary, waiting to blast
No harm with a contest who can throw the furthest
Behind the counter they look nervous
But carry on cutting the finest cuts of chicken
From the big spitting stick
Then over flies a chip, flips and hits you on the back
You spin 'round on the attack, ""Fuck you playin' at?""
He looks like a Cheshire cat, almost falls down
Your frowns and Superman eye-lasers don't even register
By now, you wanna leather this twat
And forever you're gonna regret that, your choice of path
So mash his head up and your girl's now fed up
But stop to think and it's never going to be the Jackie Chan scene

So you owe someone money subbin' scunny
Best pay me, Billy, ""No worries""
150 on Sunday, then in some way, that turns into Wednesday
Then goes straight to pay on a hazy evening in the local bar-café
What a way! What a way!
Just to recap for those at the back, this is everyday tit-for-tat
You owe your dealer and can't pay him back fee
Suddenly he's the baddy
So you tell your mates you could have him anyway, to look geez'
But he's a shady fuck, Beamer three series
Lock, stock and two fat fucks backin' him up
Can't convey enough of his desire for the paper stuff
In a blunt fashion, Billy's angry with a passion
So please just accept it ain't happenin' and go back to your runnins
'Cause you might get yourself in trouble one of these days

Would your girl like this? No, don't think so somehow
In the winter showers
But she'll never know and your face will never show shit
This is how goes it, besides she was well fit, and who could resist?
Move up to the next place, it's a smooth club
Flex, bass, beats, and your best mates
All down, nice sound, Smirnoff Ice rounds
MCs clowning, rudeboys frowning, everything's sweet
Everything's tucked in, and 'round here, we're all downing
But all of a sudden though, just through the smoke
It's your bird laughing and joking with a bloke
Ain't just that either, as she moves closer
In a shape what looks like they're lovers, he's tonguing her!
All rage sweeps up through your torso
You're more so ready to go over and show him who's man
Football fan style, leave it in the can for awhile
'Cause even as they smile, he's still got choices
Don't listen to them voices
That at the end of the day you may just have caused this
So leave the forces

In the back seat of a Buick
With the lights and the radio on
I stumbled across the grass
To the front porch through the door
Of a house that once was our home
If love once lived here you can't tell it
If I could just let go I'd sell it
Oh, I'm going under getting over you
Made my way down the hall
Through the boxes to the bed
Where I used to hold you all night long
Your perfume on the pillow
Where you once laid your head
Stays there to remind me you're gone
It's gonna tear me apart if I let it
I should just move on and forget it

I have this feeling that my luck is none too good
This sword here at my side don't act the way it should
Keeps calling me its master, but I feel like its slave
Hauling me faster and faster to an early, early grave
And it howls! It howls like hell!
I'm told it's my duty to fight against the law
That wizardry's my trade and I was born to wade through gore
I just want to be a lover, not a red-eyed screaming ghoul
I wish it'd picked another to be its killing tool


Black Blade, Black Blade
Forged a billion years ago
Black Blade, Black Blade
Killing so its power can grow 




It's death from the beginning to the end of time
And I'm the cosmic champion and I hold a mystic sign
And the whole world's dying and the burden's mine
And the black sword keeps on killing 'til the end of time


Black Blade, Black Blade
Bringing chaos to the world we know
Black Blade, Black Blade
And it's using me to kill my friends
Black Blade, Black Blade
Getting stronger so the world will end
Black Blade, Black Blade
Forcing my mind to bend and bend




I am the Black Blade
Forged a million billion years ago
My cosmic soul it goes on for eternity
Carving out destiny
Bringing in the Lords of Chaos
Bringing up the Beasts of Hades
Sucking out the souls of heroes
Laying waste to knights and ladies
My master is my slave
You poor fucking humans

I move as fast as I can
I like to get around
I'm crazy like a madman
My feet don't touch the ground


I move amongst the night life
And they just step aside
Because when they see me coming
They know I'm running wild


Dead or alive there's nothing
That bothers me at all
I take on all comers
They back off or they fall
They raise their hands to stop me
I laugh and I defy
Because what's the point in living
Unless you're living wild
No chains can hold me down
I always break away
I never hear society
Tell me what to do or say
I taste the life that pleases me
And raise a storm for all the world to see
I never stumble, never fall
Never stop for rest
I rebel but I walk tall
And I demand respect


I move amongst the night life
And they just step aside
Because when they see me coming

While niggas flirt I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside, I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh

Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with them, stole with them

Runs his hand through his thinning brown hair

Paralyzed and you don't know why
Feeling like somebody's fool
Try to find some peace of mind
Maybe you're hiding the truth
Thought it'd be better in a world so cold
But I want to tell you what I've been told


Life ain't that bad
Look what you have
When the highs aren't so high
Just do what you can
A world you can change
And a life you choose
'Cause somewhere out there
Somebody wishes they were you

Of someone with nothing to lose
Change alone is not set in stone

Run for it

I am aching, near breaking
I'm just taking my time to stand in line
For a dance with you, woah, dance with you, oh
It may not appear, but it's been fully clear
That I'm standing here, fully pleading, near bleeding
Dying, competing for a chance with you, oh, whoa


Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you


If you stand with my heart in hand
Oh, perfect and, perfect and, perfect and
So unaware of my longing stare
If all I care is to dance with you


Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I could stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you


I freeze, I feel debris, my hands been seized
My thoughts are cut, I close my eyes shut
Knowing it's not you, but there's a chance it's you
For a dance with me, oh, woah, hey, woah-oh-oh

"From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No-one asks us how we'd like to be
In school they teach us what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see

So they keep talking and they never stop
At a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
Cause I decide the way things gonna be

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

There's a million ways  to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool 
In the end of it,  none of us is right
Sometimes, we need to be alone 

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave me alone

To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

And to find it how often I've tried
But my life is a race just a wild goose chase
And all my dreams have been denied
Why have I always been a failure
What can the reason be
I wonder if the world's to blame
I wonder if it could be me
I'm always chasing rainbows, watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
And some fellows make a winning sometime
And I never even make a gain
I'm always chasing rainbows waiting to find the little bluebird in vain

I'm dead heading down from Tulsa
Going back to San Antone
My baby called me up this morning
Begging me to come back home
Hauling high hopes and thin air
Losing money by the mile
I'll get there a poor man
She'll make it worth my while


I was a white line casanova
A love bandit of the road
I got the one I can't get over
I miss her more with every load
I got these eighteen wheels
Singing home sweet home
I been too long gone
Oh I'm coming home to you


I ain't left the fast lane
Since I hit the last toll gate
I know she's out there waiting in that Lone Star state
She'll be standing on the front porch
Reaching out with open arms
This woman's out to get me
Shoot the dog and sell the farm




I got a white knuckle grip
On this wheel in my hand
I'm rolling down the highway
Just as fast as I can
I'm blowing smoke from both stacks
Picking them up, I'm putting them down
There won't be no time at all
Until I'll be rolling into town




Yea I got these eighteen wheels
Singin' home sweet home
I been too long gone
Oh I'm coming home to ya

I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day


Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep, the sounds awake me
I let them take me



Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry




Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day


Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me



Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry




Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when the day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak

You're standing in rags
You're selling your flags

But when your conscience pricks
A little sacrifice sweetens the pill

With a little bit more character for show

Then I'm putting out the lantern, find your own way back home

I'll write it all across the wall before my job is done

""Now watch me faggots""


Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kick off the front floor
Mine, something inside I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real, I'll never ever follow
Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on
Hate, something, someway, each day
Dealing with no forgiveness
Why, this shit inside, now everyone will follow
So give me nothing just feel and now this shit will follow


God pains me, the more I see the life, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something they took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see so come dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Me!

Had enough of heartbreak and pain
I had a little sweet spot for the rain
For the rain and skies of grey
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?


You know I always liked my walking shoes
But you can get a little too fond of the blues
You walk too far, you walk away
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?


You know I always loved a lonely town
Those empty streets, no one around
You fall in love with lonely, you end up that way
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?


You know I always liked that empty road
No place to be and miles to go
But miles to go is miles away
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?


And miles to go is miles away
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?

Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
""Do you know who you're talking to?""
""No, and I don't care who""
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said, ""Do what you have to do""


All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
""Please say no more
I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete""
Her name was just a broken sound
A stutter step you hear when you're falling down


Killing time won't stop this crime
Killing time won't stop this crime

No more situations I only go in to be kicked out

And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime
""You were just fine
You'll be just fine
But I'm on the other line""

"Souljah
Everytime I read your letters it makes me smile, think, laugh, and marvel at how easy it is 4 us 2 relate to one another  It is my wish that when this letter reaches you it finds you and your family in safety and serenity. Now, where do I start? I'm sitting here with a fat stack of letters and through them all I immediately recognize your handwriting and know that you finally written me back and as usual it was worth the wait. This letter is hard to write because I'm editing as I write. I'm preoccupied with having any of my statements misjudged as ""hustling""! :) First of all, let me answer your questions. #1. No, I don't mind long letters in fact I wish yours were longer and yes I would love to not only hear of your adventures but also share some of my own. Yes, I will write a book. Right now I'm writing 3 screenplays so upon my release I can recoup from my losses. Instead of complaining about bad movie roles or negative stereotypes I'm writing my own visions. As far as the book is concerned, I am working on doing an Autobiography but if it is at all possible I want us to do a book together. That would truly be the ""BOMB""! Let me just tell you ever since I've read your book it has been going from person to person like a bible. Everybody from male inmates to female inmates have been reading it. I get a sense of pride at being the person to turn them on to your literary talents. Plus, I use your book with the women in my life. I have asked two females to read it and we use each chapter as a door to our own lives. Like the chapter on Nikki is my favorite. I was trying over the past few months to this female in my life why it was so hard 4 me 2 trust her regardless of how sweet and innocent she portrayed herself to be and only after reading that chapter did she finally understand. This is some personal shit but I feel as though I can trust you so.... Okay there's that chapter where you were contemplating sharing this man with another woman. I'm in that position now. I love one woman  because she's dependable, loving, supportive, and she's young and open to me guiding her through this crazy life  Anyway woman ""A"" is from the streets and that's all she knows but I can see and feel how much she loves me. Woman ""B"" on the other hand is famous, rich, and able to assist me financially, loving, and very sexual. She's known me since before I got into the business and she's been there from the jump. However, she's bisexual and so into her career that we don't have much time together. So I'm literally torn between an old friend who went from being of a platonic nature to a potential wife and a new friend who has been there through the whole gunshot/rape/near death experience. I have rejected them both but then reconsidered and got 'em both back. They know of the other and I have tried to make it work as a threesome. Not sexually but commitment wise. Had I not read your book I would have continued living and juggling with all of these other women but between them both I completely satisfied. I've always felt that when I love someone it is so intense that I drive them away but with ""A"" and ""B"" it evens everything out. I can satisfy both of them and not because I'm a ""Supermanlove"" but because I truly love them both and the intensity and passion I feel for them keeps me driven to please them. Can u feel me? It's hard to explain on paper maybe when you visit me I can elaborate which brings me to my next step. Yes I would love 4 u 2 come visit me there isn't a list but there are certain days and times for each inmate. I'll attempt to reach you by phone to make it happen. Now back to me controlling my sexual desires. Now be honest, as a woman, how could you love a man that couldn't satisfy you? Since men are born totally inept sexually we only learn how 2 please a woman from pleasing a woman. So as rotten as it seems practice makes perfect. Every woman I have been with has not only taken what I learned from the last woman but taught me and prepared me for the next and since I am not married and yet to find the perfect woman you described I am forever in search of her. I have been with many married women from wives of powerful drug lords to the wives of broke everyday Joes to the wives of quite a few very famous and rich singers/actors and seeing their wives hungry for someone else has shown me that only by being able to completely satisfy a woman in every way, shape, and form can I truly find a happy and trusting faithful relationship. Now to answer your other questions. My health is fine I truly feel blessed that other than mentally I have no scars or lasting problems from my ""ordeal"". I still have the complete use of every nerve, limb, and muscle and more surprisingly I can still make love and have babies after taking a shot to my scrotum! Talk about faith in God! :)! Mentally however the helpless feeling never leaves me. I can't sleep! I wake up sweaty and disorientated when I do doze off and I will never erase the faces of my attackers from my mind. 2 be honest the bullets didn't hurt much not at first but afterwards it was painful. I didn't feel the shots in my head, hand, scrotum but because of all the muscles involved the leg wound was a real bitch! I don't really have any gun phobias meaning if it happened again I would react the same way. The pain came as I lay in the hospital thinking about the fact that some ""Thug"" brothers shot me. Then to hear I was found guilty of something I had not done plus wondering if my family was safe SCARED ME! Even with 5 gunshot wounds my paranoid ass was still sleeping with a 12 gauge and a Glock. I never planned to turn myself in I planned on shooting it out but upon further reflection I realized I owed alot to my people. Although I would have been at peace, the misery of our folks would continue. Besides I'm a Soldier and Soldiers use strategy not emotion no matter how bad the odds!

Steer your way past the ruins of the altar and the mall
Steer your way through the fables of creation and the fall
Steer your way past the palaces that rise above the rot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your heart past the truth that you believed in yesterday
Such as fundamental goodness and the wisdom of the way
Steer your heart, precious heart, past the women whom you bought
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your way through the pain that is far more real than you
That smashed the cosmic model, that blinded every view
And please don't make me go there, though there be a God or not
Year by year, month by month, day by day

They whisper still, the ancient stones
The blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy
Let us die to make things cheap
And say the mea culpa, which you probably forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day

Steer your way, o my heart, though I have no right to ask
To the one who was never, never equal to the task
Who knows he's been convicted, who knows he will be shot

"Scatter gun blast, tens in the air
Half a million in a burlap sack
Y'all have a nice day as we make our way
To the caddie in the ally out back
See when the times get hard
Some good old boys turn to a life a sin
We're like Robin Hood, we're just twice as good
But we can never go home again

Well I grew up singing Amazing Grace
In a little white church in the woods
My momma prayed hard for all her boys
But her praying didn't do a bit of good
The sheriff and a banker man came to push us off of our land
Now we're six feet deep
And my brothers and me we can never go home again

Lord forgive me, I know just what I do
I'll take what I need and then
I leave the rest to my momma and you
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven
But it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul
I can never go home again

Sometimes I dream of that old front porch and my momma patching up a quilt
While my brothers and me lay around in the shade of that live oak tree on the hill
Now it's hide-out shacks, better watch your back and cover every track of where you've been
A thousand wrongs will never make it right, I can never go home again

Lord forgive me, I know just what I do
I'll take what I need and then
I leave the rest to my momma and you
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven
But it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul
I can never go home again

Scatter gun blast tears a ten inch hole
Through an empty burlap sack
As I say my peace for my brothers and me
My whole world fades to black
Here's three new graves underneath the shade of
That live oak tree on the hill
Overlooking momma's porch with a fresh coat of paint
And a shiny new Coup De Ville

Lord forgive me, I know just what I've done
I've been through hell and found myself on the wrong end of a gun
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven but it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul, I thought I'd never make it home
God bless an outlaw's weary soul, I guess I finally made it home again

I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane
And though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet again
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirror
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer
I asked him would he hurry
But we crawled the canyons slowly
Through the buyers and the sellers
Through the burglar bells and the wishing wells
With gangs and girly shows
The ghostly garden grows


The cars and buses bustled thru the bedlam of the day
I looked through window-glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons
The city grated through chrome-plate
The clock struck slowly half-past-noon
Through the tunnel tiled and turning
Into daylight once again I am escaping
Once again goodbye
To symphonies and dirty trees
With parks and plastic clothes
The ghostly garden grows


He asked me for a dollar more
He cursed me to my face
He hated everyone who paid to ride
And share his common space
I picked my bags up from the curb
And stumbled to the door
Another man reached out his hand
Another hand reached out for more
And I filled it full of silver
And I left the fingers counting
And the sky goes on forever
Without meter maids and peace parades


You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows
You feed it all your woes

Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, it’s a memory now

Where's the respect? I don't feel it

Well the devil may care
You toss them back and be a man

End of it all, end of the line
End of the road

Come on and bleeding out the crowds
We are watching all the women go
Many a mile I will never take
I run for forty miles and come up running late
Don’t you know I live it down
When the devil come a calling I am not going to be around

The devil come a calling I am not going to be around

Living long, living long
Shoot for the moon, you're gonna take it all
And I am going to rip it out

I'll gouge your eyes out

Let this acid daze me

Gotta get me living simple

Look at these colors around me

My only solidity barely be seeing my art
Just see my mentions when I trip on water visions
Altered mission like I live my life on intermissions

Split a million, let me pass up
What the fuck, I'm tripping
I can see you sippin' while I'm fuckin' livin'

While I'm fucking livin'

Hit up the plug
I'm losing my mind
Drop all time
Get lost in my eyes
Sitting past living just to die
Tell family that I said goodbye

Look at my eyes and look at yourself and tell me if you really worth my time well please go somewhere else until you know my fucking love well some might call me devil but you so disheveled bitch I left my body simple call me god and pray to god that these new sings are gonna love and nasty shit at angry mobs it hit the fan so consciousness is short at span and you gonna lose your fan the dummy system and fuck it listen when I speak and never put your mind in the auto in mind cause they might even die make a hit masterprize they might come for me next but I'm one in the rest put yourself to the test because I only ever want to be the best

Amar, Amar, c'mon

Hope you did your homework already

Nah, it's time to go to..

What happened?

What, what?

Ok, ok
Aight, this is how it went down, here we go..


We talkin' a few years before you even appeared
I was into my little gear
Yeah - weed and my beer
Hustlin' out of fear, fear of bein' a square
Like them cowards with no gear
They just breathin' the air
Son, clear, but didn't realize life ain't fair
With one drive-by, it could end your life right there
Though I'm a fly guy, from then, tied my Nikes, like chea
Fuck the world we can fight right here, I don't scare
From beer, no more nightmares here, not a tear
I was straighter than the white man's hair
Met Nasir, had that hype that year
Like a kite, threw me a mic
I took flight right there, chea
Rap wise I was nice I swear
Went fool with the jewels, even iced my ears
New school, I was cool, wore righteous wears
But from the door they didn't like that there, I ain't care
As long as I left the china white right there
And understood that you could change a life through prayer
But it's all good, police even politely stared
It was unreal, but still now it feels slightly weird
I was spared, gave love, taught my peers
Though it was rough, never gave up, fought my fears
Now it's like ""what?""
I'm G'ed up, awesome glare
Entertainer from the streets with a sportsman's flair


Heeeeere we go!
Out the gate, he who hate - himself ain't straight
He a snake, he the type who send himself upstate
Catch a case for a plate
He ain't have to take, he coulda
Played it safe, said his grace and ate
But it's fate, when a person makes certain mistakes
What a waste, how the world..

"All these words you speak to me are from a foreign land
You're telling me that birds don't fly
How can it be that you love her
You don't have to raise your voice, I still don't understand
There's me and you, and you and me
So how can it be that you love her?

It was alchemy to sing to me your freedom song
To make love where there was none
Alchemy, now it's all gone
She is the golden one

So what are you saying, we've got to dismantle it all

Rip off the paper, smash up the walls, how can it be that you love her?
Take all of the things we so carefully made
Take all of the life that you've betrayed
How can it be that you love her

It was alchemy to sing to me your freedom song
To make love where there was none
Alchemy, now it's all gone

I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed

Come back, baby, say we never more will part

Where the rain don't fall and the grass don't grow
The older part of New Mexico
I drifted into town one day
And stumbled in on a lost cafe
Shades were pulled and the door was locked
Something made me knock
Time stood still when she opened the door
I didn't know where I was anymore
And we were lost in each other's eyes
Where loneliness meets paradise
Something in my heart broke free
Blowing wind as the tumbleweed


Somewhere north of heaven
Where eagles fear to fly
Where the sun burns hot as the devil's gate
The desert meets the sky
Tattooed on my memory is the image of an angels face
North of heaven, south of Santa Fe


Bad news tends to travel fast
I was running from my past
I left her when their morning broke
Truth is I never let her go
I'm still running free
But in my heart I'll always be

"Where we gonna go
I'm gassed up, I'm ready to go
Grab your jacket, Let's hit the road
We can't wait any longer, Let's go

She's looking out the window
And her baby starting to show
From five months ago
So keep driving, keep driving through the snow

I passed by my folks on side of the road, but I'm through it everyone
We can't let go, You can't let go of the wheel
And I pass by my friends on either end, But I'm through it all of them
I can't let go, We can't let go of the wheel

Hoping land for miles is Nebraska in my eye
And we still crystallize
Any longer any longer

Trees and power lines are all dressed in the ice
And we still crystallize
Keep moving keep moving through the eye

See the road swallow us whole, and we're still alive ...
But I can't let go, I can't let go of the wheel
And water break on a burning wick and douse the flame kill her quiver
We can't let go, We can't let go of eachother
Shes crying saying it's nobody's fault, shes already a pillar of salt
We're too dissolved, we're too dissolved into the road

Our story began in the heart of a star
We've lost our way, forgotten what we are
We are only particles in motion
Floating through space, a destructive race
What a destructive race


Look at this life as a grain of sand
The blink of an eye, a world in your hands
Look at this life as a grain of sand
The blink of an eye


We're all thinking, feeling, surviving, believing
In what we think is right, refract distorted light
You helped build this fire inside of me
Breathing fire won't burn down the borders
Set against everything that came before us
All those things that you despise
We all see through human eyes
Thinking, feeling, surviving, believing
In what we think is right, refract distorted light
You helped build this fire inside of me
Breathing fire won't burn down the borders
Set against everything that came before us
There is no side for us to choose
Bound together, we all win or all lose


Look at this life as a grain of sand
The blink of an eye, a world in your hands
Look at this life as a grain of sand
The blink of an eye, a world in your hands


Oh, life is so short, take a moment to feel alive
I know all we meant was to expand and to thrive
But we sharpened our claws and we went to war
With ourselves, with each other, with the rich and with the poor
With anyone different who believes in less or more
Step out of the shadow, cast by left and right wings
Take refuge in each other and the triumph that it brings
Since we stood on two feet, we've been worth so much more
Now tear down the walls that were built to divide
It's time to extinguish that fire that fire inside

"I-64 goes from some place bad
To some place better
Better 'cause it's far, far away
From where i met her
And because it's unknown
Life is worth nothing
All my love is in a hole
And is dead
There is no heaven for love
It simply dies
The hills of West Virginia
Offer respite for my eyes
But like Utah and all things lovely
The loveliness is lies
We learn that she who screams the loudest
Makes he who fears most run
And who is ruled by fear
Is oft ignored by fun
Still there is a way to be
If we die many times
Then let death come to me...
This is the last song of its kind
Now you can be
Now you can be
All that all your weakest love can find
Ain't it the best
Ain't it the best

Two headed boy
All floating in glass
The sun it has passed
Now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar
And I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are


Two headed boy
Put on Sunday shoes
And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark


We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers
Through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving, now
They just lay there in their climb


Two headed boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face
And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face


And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking
Everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving, now
They just lay there in their climb


Two headed boy
There's no reason to grieve
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go

I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I've spent all my money
On whiskey and beer
I go to some hollow
And sit at my still
And if whiskey dont kill me
Then I dont know what will


I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow
And see what I spend
God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet
The dew on the vine


Let me eat when I am hungry
Let me drink when I am dry
A dollar when I am hard up
Religion when I die
The whole world's a bottle
And life's but a dram
When the bottle gets empty
It sure ain't worth a damn

Yo, yo-yo, yo
90's era Nasty, yeah
Yo, Ty Beats!


I need some time alone
Cold, my rhymes will turn your mind to stone
That's the work of satan niggas be hatin' but I'm a pot of gold
This ain't just me rappin' it's real and somethin' you gots to know
Catch a mark nigga hatin', get him a casket, that bastard's 'bout to go
Whoa, Nasty baby I'm crazy, the 90's raised me
I'm just as smart, probably smarter than half the cats who play me
Brazy, drivin' Miss Daisy, hand on my strap
In my zone, mind on my money like where that shit at?
I'm all alone, that's my only hope
And be damned if I'ma chase that with some phony homes, on the real
It be the ones that say, ""We got this, that you ain't alone""
As long as I'm here to pull out the Glock 9 and cocked it
He mad you got rich but on the low you should've watched him
Cats connivin', head first into the livest object
""That was your man, now you 'bout to die quick""
Over some fly shit, you feel reminded of your fast-life ventures
And winters, blinded 'til the flashlight enters

Got too many less-than-impressive rappers left in my path
Better yet, we gon' leave 'em left in the past
Someone slides, this time I ride, you get left in the back
Who am I? I'm a titan so be expectin' a clash
Start to wavin' arms at you, you'd think I'm catchin' a cab
No questions, live the answers cause if you're lookin' to ask
Look at Meth, breakin' bad like he cookin' meth in the lab
Still a lethal weapon but try and bless him with math
Rappers never learn their lesson so I ain't lettin' 'em pass
I ain't lettin' 'em brag, I ain't lettin' 'em swag

Fools get rowdy, ain't nothin' dumb, my guns from Saudi
High off the Maui, don't trip your weed, rollin' the finest
You know the fronto, Sucio Guapo, I'm head honcho

Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace
Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung
And taking my gypsy before she's begun

To sing in the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joining and a-listening and talking in rhymes
Stopping the feeling to wait for the time

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

And who's all hung up on that happiness thing
Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
With pencil and paper just counting the score

Who's trying to act like he's just in-between
The line isn't black if you know that it's green
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five
Who's got the feeling to keep him alive
Though having it, sharing it ain't quite the same
It ain't a gold nugget, you can't lay a claim

Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor
There it is, baby, don't you worry no more
Who should be sleeping, but is writing this song
Wishing and a-hoping he weren't so damned wrong

Here the future is only so near
Why should we all be alone
Every night on the way home
This time we should be starting again
Get up I'm counting to 10
Seeing you comb on your hair
Pretending that no one is there
You know it can be better than that


But wait until tomorrow morning
Learning to be you is what hurts most
Close your eyes and hold your terror close


Out here I hear you come in loud and clear
I carried you 'til it got dark
And then walked you home through the park
You're right, strangers are easy to like
Thunder and lightning will strike
Make the move you'll get the knack
Echoes that don't answer back
Just please give me a chance to say no

Still clown with the Underground, when we come around


Stronger than ever



Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

Why I ain't call you? Hahaha, please...


Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone, why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it  why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real G's doin' time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around


What you mean you don't know?

Check it, check it, I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes

I get around, still down with the Underground

I get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know



Now you can tell from my everyday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks 
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix 
Tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents 
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around


Round and round, the Town we go
But the Underground just don't stop for hoes
What do ya know? Another young bro making dough
But the po-po won't let me go, tryna do my show
But other young bros wanna throw
Time to hit the do', grab a hoe
Don't forget my dough, and if the promo say ""no""
Let 'em meet my 4-4, I'm from the O
And yo, I get around

Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh
And now Bush can't stop the hit

Felt good in the hood being around the niggas

We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The Penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather I'd be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals

If I 'url while I go around, what the hell

To have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel
My young nigga motto was, ""Fuck it, I'm already grown""

And I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted
And my mom and my pop, they just grin
And empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens
Them grown-up stories don't work
In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids
Fuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up
They stood on the corner
Like you once upon a, time
And probably felt like a loner
And smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning
Complaining that you always moaning
Never saying good morning
Storming out my house
And slamming doors like you paying bills
They been through it too, though
They were kids like you, though
But what if they knew though
And hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing, no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court
With no high percentage shot
Just a bunch of, ""You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got""
Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht
But ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking
I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty
Shit, their blood pressure high, why?
They don't play no more, probably

The scripture says Allah's inside me, show love
I was hugged by the arms of Gandhi, gave me my strength
You could tell somebody raised me with sense
We all need somethin to help us through our daily events
Bear with me; the toughest niggas tear quickly
No lie - pops still cry and he near fifty - freedom or death
I give niggas a reason to sweat, there's no test

Seperate the weaker niggas is the best way, fuck how y'all feel
Y'all cowards now fuckin with real

I move like a nigga coppin
I know the stress from the streets when I was diddy-boppin
Playin the corners face to face with the faces of mourners
It's hard to trace the informers until it's too late, Jake rest on my corners
The focus is back, I play a part in this culture of rap
Bought some whips so I relate on how these vultures attack
Flippin and runnin, double-park, rippin up summons
How many niggas hittin twin sisters and flippin they cousins?
Call it finesse, the game give it all I posess
Nothin changed, I'mma ball to the death




Yeah, that's right
Show these cats how we do this here nigga

I'm like a, rose in the desert but how can one grow without rain?
How can one experience happiness without pain?
And how could I fall to the violence of hell and still remain sane?
And how could I still remain on top of my game?
When both the black and white devils seek the power to rebel
Seek to defy my radiance, I shift gears to another level
I'm focused, but it's like I'm playin a cold hand of spades
I got a lot of hearts, but these fools tryin to cut me
And I'm tired of these jokers
Vengeance is mine, I plague the whole planet with locusts
I survived the mayhem, my advantage I've been the brokest
I wasn't drugged and inhaled by all the smokers
Then I became the love absorbed by all the cultures
I can't trust women because my heart was scorned
It's hard to trust yo' comrades, when yo' heart was torn

He don't want the room or want the loot he's in it for the sport

He appreciates your support but he ain't begging for it

Feels like strangers
Is playing on your loving so
Dangerous, ooh yeah

Under the moonlight
My heart is breaking, girl

"Now the Swan it floated on the English river
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer
And the judges watched us from the other side

I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you
Preserve my room but do not shed a tear
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you
It was half my fault and half the atmosphere""

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever
And the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame
She said at last I was her finest lover
And if she withered I would be to blame

The judges said you missed it by a fraction
Rise up and brace your troops for the attack
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action
Oh see the men of action falling back

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still
My falsity had stung me like a hornet
The poison sank and it paralysed my will

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers
That they had been deserted from above
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona
I'm listed with the enemies of love

And long ago she said ""I must be leaving
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""

So daily I renew my idle duty
I touch her here and there -- I know my place
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty
And people call me traitor to my face

The keys are still hanging in the front door
You're hanging all over me
And in between kisses, I hear you whisper
Something 'bout loving me
There's a half a glass sitting on the table
The other half spilled on the bed
I'm halfway believing you're really meaning
Every sweet word you just said
Or is it just that bottle of red?


When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room stops spinning round and round
Will you still be holding on?
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong?
Tell me, will you still be mine
Baby, when the wine wears off?


When I wake up in the morning
Will you be in my arms?
When the sun starts shining through those blinds
Will you mean what you said in the dark
Or will I have a headache and a broken heart?


When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room stops spinning round and round
Will you still be holding on?
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong?
Tell me, will you still be mine
Baby, when the wine wears off?




I don't want you to stop kissing me now
Keep on loving me, laying me down
I'll close my eyes and hide from these doubts
Do my best to not worry about


When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room stops spinning round and round
Will you still be holding on?
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong?
Tell me, will you still be mine
Baby, when the wine wears off?


Will you still be mine
Baby, when the wine wears off?

Stunt when I want, ride new shit
Unh, all I do is this
Unh, niggas new to this


I’m super-rich like Russell, naw Leor
I’m decked out, my bitch smell like Dior
She spoiled, she want it, she can have that
Your bitch cool, but where her Birkin bag at?
You can tell a lot about a nigga by his bitch
Be my guest, look at mine, I’m the shit
I’m hot, my shit bump coast to coast, don’t it?
I get bread my watch I blew a loaf on it
Get caught staring at that get smoked for it
Fool, my swag unlimited
So fly, ain’t shit I can’t buy
Louboutin kicks, my Louis Vuitton bitch
Fresh off the runway, get your one one-day
Catch me in Milan, tuxedo on
The black James Bond, nigga I’m a Don
I do what I want, when and where I want


Put your hands up, put ‘em where my eyes can see
What’s up, you know you wanna party with me
Let’s fuck, we wilding in the place to be
Bitch quit playing
Put your hands up, put ‘em where my eyes can see
What’s up, you know you wanna party with me
Let’s fuck, we wilding in the place to be

Catch me riding solo, Purple Label Polo
Paparaz’ photo my side bitch in Manolo
It’s all about dough though, my knuckle game like Cotto
Plus I get to shooting, but keep that on the low though
 Nigga, I don’t really got to talk about it
Me, I get paper, moves I make major
Shoes I rock – gator, wing tips player
My style so pure, I’m so couture
I’m down by law, certified B-boy
Hold up, wait a minute, money – I’m gonna spend it
Or why the fuck would I hustle hard to get it?
So many flows, the hoes be on the di-dick
And when they pop it and lock it, they know I’m with it
Dame lengua, give tongue while I hit it
She a star, fresh from PR
Give me more, baby give me more


Put your hands up, put ‘em where my eyes can see
What’s up, you know you wanna party with me
Let’s fuck, we wilding in the place to be

Put your hands up, put ‘em where my eyes can see

They claim that I'm violent
Just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin fits
Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it
Envious because I will rebel against any oppressor
And this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm never ignorant, getting goals accomplished
The underground railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this
My words are weapons, and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you claim that I'm violent



The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin to rob me?""
He had tha nerve to say that I had a curfew
Get out the car, or I'll hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
""What you doin' man?"", They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked, he tried to run
I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped so, I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste of tradin' places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up, now they claimin' that I'm violent



As I was beatin' on the cop, I heard a gun click
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop, now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car, and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start, we in deep shit
So we jumped out
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
Load em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin', then we steppin'
This is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One things fo' sho', tomorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me
Pass me a clip G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin' them a reason 
To claim that I'm violent

My gates are ignored
My thoughts are negated
And you're on a roll
And I am offended
By your acts of shamelessness
Your lack of conscience
And your flagrant steamroll

My fears are founded
This dam is no more

Standing on the rooftop
Just out of earshot
Looking at this gangster guy
Thinking he's a hot shot
Pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high

He wishes to be seen with me
In his limousine
And he says we'll have a real good time
Well X-X-O but I want you to know


Every single night
In the lights
I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl
Trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight
It's alright
Let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl
And I'm just warning you

You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
 I won't fall in love
 I won't ever stop
 I'm partying all night
 I'm gonna make it pop



Kissing on your light yacht
Show me what you got got
Play a little rock n roll
On an island hotspot
Maybe we should dot dot dot


Do you think it's really mean
That I'm only on the scene
Cause I want a little danger boy?
Well X-X-O but I told you so


Every single night
In the lights
I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl
Trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight

Just forget about us

Put your cigarette down
Baby light up the town
Beside me

Leave me in a world so broke, so cold?""

God made trees

Our God took a little bit of dirt and made man
Imagine where your life could go in His hands
You don't understand, picture this:
Thorns in His head, nails in His wrist
Streched like this
Dying for us, yeah, extraordinary
In God, I trust
He died for me, I died for Him
He died perfect, Lord I've sinned
Take me in, set me free
Without You, I'm not me
We're not worthy of Your Grace

Yeah, and that's the truth, y'all
You don't look for the truth, you not gonna find the truth, most of us

Which caused me to stay for a while

Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle


I humbled myself to her beauty
""Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne?""


""Young man, I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure


Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle.""

I came here to fulfill our last promise

For me there is no other damsel

You niggas softer than silicone
You know what it's like when the feelin' gone
I know what it's like when the ceilin' gone

Turn the White House to the Terror Dome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch!

Shut up!
Shut up!

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway


Just like before…


Everything you say to me

I need a little room to breathe



I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense

Nothing seems to go away

Tryna' walk away from a life of sorrow

Trying not to rob G's, still I borrow


I need to take it slow
My heart is growing cold
I'm tryna' hide my feelings
From the people that I know
And everywhere I go I'm trying to lay low
Can't afford to get in no trouble cuz I'm on parole

I'm tryna' live life right
God knows with all my might
But I'm just barely getting by
Cuz money's way too tight
And I can say this right
The struggle and the fight
It's weakin' all the muscles in my body like kryptonite
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Got me hopin' and then prayin' for a better day...So!

Cuz all I did was impress, my homie!
And then my conscience told me
""Careful you tendarone!""
Always complaining after I ain't never did
She always lonely. So what am I to do
Gotta get money for food, cuz if she starves to death
Then I gotta deal with her attitude
And I in that type of mood cuz I ain't type of dude

Is there a way that we can all erase mistakes and start anew?
Don't mislead us and stop stabbing with blunt knives

And get your hair up out the way

Soon as the lights out, she gon' pull the pipe out
She don't want no popcorn, she just want her mouth on me

Sit up on me, head towel
Grippin' locks with the right palm

Tears fallin' down my left cheek
Baby hit the nerve like a Pepsi

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' 80 on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it

Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic

Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery

Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck

Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major

They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me, hahaha
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it

They got me sittin' wonderin', where my life begins

'Cause I roll with Immortal Thug niggas
And my number one plan to kill a man
To grab a needle and drug niggas
Niggas don't like us, because they bitches straight love us

How many niggas fall in your vision?
Gunnin' 'em down for every last minute that I spent in prison
We mash together, plus we get cash together
Blast whenever, knowin' it don't last forever
It's only one way out and one way in
Motherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot
Blow the roof off them groups like Rauf al-Mabhouh
I can't be touched, 'cause of the weapons I clutch
And the niggas that I'm under is just too much: we made niggas


Picture the scenery, 'cause for now you gon' have to imagine
Call me your prophet 'cause I predicted what's gon' happen

Will emerge like crack in the 80's
Fade me? Maybe, that's if I slip
But I became official since the start of this
Edi Amin, born July, 7th, a few shed eyes, precious
But others gave me they hate to cherish
But still I made it, a made nigga made by the game
Made for war, my aim is simple and plain
Yeah, whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain
You'll forever know my name, Edi, a made nigga


I ain't count the line, my strap, my head
There will be none of that

With the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga
'Til he still and chill, recognize the real deal
Feel — a nigga made when I was young and dumb
With a gun, but it pays, so I'm bustin' for fun
And the outcome will be the same every time
We all gon' die, get yours 'cause I'ma get mine


Tha Outlawz, we be the Don Juan's of this rough shit
Rhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public
With my mentality of war
Dead bodies and silence, give it to you raw
Thug nigga to the core
The results of livin' poor, got me thinkin' on a made level
Shootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin' crazed devil
Mash shit from here to here, day by day, year to year
Made niggas on your motherfuckin' tear: I'm a made nigga


Call me a Bad Boy killer, murder motherfuckers daily
Know the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli
Gettin' lessons from niggas in penitentiaries
Game, when applied, help me survive several centuries
Lock me in a cage, I'll display my rage
Surround the court buildin' with the gauge and spray
They wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced
On my knees to God, beggin' for repentance
I'm so convinced that I'm a thug
They got me fiendin' for my cash
Like a fiend when he dreams of drugs
Diss the dada and I'll kidnap your daughter
Kill your wife and hit the funeral
And tell you just who gave the order
Makaveli the Don 'til I'm gone
I maintain my army of lunatics that stay armed
'Til the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga
Outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga


Can you feel me? Come closer, ha ha ha
Get into the mind of a made nigga, I can't be touched
My adversaries get fucked, feel me?
Multimillionaire dreams
All I want is the C.R.E.A.M.
I sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream
Come and see, to see a made nigga

Napoleon, Kadafi, Mussolini, M.O.B.

To take away all the hatred

And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem
Nation shall not raise sword against nation
And they shall not learn war, anymore
For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken""


Waiting for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye

How long will we be waiting
For your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye?

In my arms
She said she would
Always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool

I threw it all away

Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through
Every day
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had

Until I threw it all away

Love is all there is
It makes the world go ’round
Love and only love
It can’t be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won’t be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who’s tried

So if you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray
For one thing for certain
You will surely be a-hurtin'

All I want is land enough for my children to run
In the highest pitch of grace, the end of trial and gratitude
It was for you that all others I did forsake
For you all others I would forsake

How could it have been so often that we did speak of purpose and of having

Dreamt his body with his back to the lake, certain depths I cannot place
Walk and talk fine through all of the days, still I miss the words you’d say
Past the point now of trusting it to change
I've just learned to live around it

Still, I will sleep too long or I will hardly sleep at all
So from where does energy come

Meet me by the fire door, of happiness I don’t ask more
She is who I cut root vegetables beside, with you still in my mind
It is with them that we spend our nights, laughter that tides through the rest
But I liked it best when the morning had not left
And wake was not yet in your eyes

High, high, high, low, low, low
I would have seen you through both

Running away from my past
It's pushin' me out of my zone
Pullin' me under the gun, into the unknown


I'm letting go, givin' up the control
Yeah, I'm ready to go wherever the wind blows
I wanna see where the road's gonna lead
Time is tickin' and the world is not waitin' on me


I've been dodgin' raindrops for far too long
These clouds over my head, they won't move on
I've been dodgin raindrops, tryin' not to get wet
I've been dodgin' raindrops for far too long


Dodgin' raindrops
But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head
But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head

But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head

But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head


Ready to go outside
And to be livin' life
Instead of watching out the window


I've been dodgin' raindrops for far too long
These clouds over my head, they won't move on
I've been dodgin raindrops, tryin' not to get wet
I've been dodgin' raindrops for far too long


Dodgin' raindrops
But they're all in my head, but they're all in my head

I could see it coming from a mile away
A heartache looking for a place to stay
But I couldn't resist her and I couldn't be cool
The Lord made a woman to make a man a fool


It's an age old story but it still holds true
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do
He'll loves some woman until he goes insane
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train


I was drunk and crazy by her sweet perfume
But I knew stone sober I was being used
Now, the heartache lingers like a cheap cologne
She took all she wanted and she was gone




It was almost worth it for the time we spent
Because there ain't no future in a heart for rent
Still she taught me something about the facts of life
That love cuts quicker than a switch-blade knife




A short sweet ride on a runaway train

"This life's electric
You can feel the pulse out on the street
The boys keep moving
Girls they always seem to follow the beat
This town it breathes in
A hunger deeper down it's underground
These changes, they change
Familiar faces at one time look strange

Call me crazy cause I still hold on
Call me foolish I'm a believer
We were never meant to walk alone
I don't think I'm the last of the dreamers

City's electric tonight
Burning under bright lights
The city's so active, alive
Can you feel it?
You know we're living out loud
Like we still need it
City electric
The city's electric tonight

The search is still on
Voices calling out from wilderness
Some say to let go
Some things are out of your control
I tried but I just can't stop
Tried but I can't stop
Til we progress

Call me crazy but there's still a chance
Call me foolish, an overachiever
We can be exactly who we want
I don't think I'm the last of the dreamers

Live like you feel it
Live like you need it
Live like you feel this
Live like you love
Live the life you love

Fucking Ruby got a blunt with a flame at the tip
Got a brain with a slit
Fotta get it zipped before I feel the pain of the split
No, that ain't a dame, that's a bitch, put the blame on the dick
Walkin' with a lame leg limp
Put my name on a blimp
Eating steak, couple shrimp

Make a pimp pay me for his bitch, and then I slit her wrists
All day, same shit
Spray mist, gang grey
Dead fake boys floatin' in the lake

Sippin' gasoline on a plane, matching me, I'ma flame
Blowin' up, glowin' up, fuck what you motherfucking claim, bitch!

Son come un automa
Studio e non so cosa studio
Sei un chiodo fisso

Non posso credere che
Che prima di conoscere te
Io fossi il primo

Confondo Newton con Einstein
E tutte le loro leggi fisiche
E in ogni formula ci sei tu
L'equazione che non si risolve

Sai cos'e' l'amore?
Forse e'una trappola...
Che ci tende
La natura

Nooo! Non voglio credere
Che e' una trappola
E che la natura ci ha dato
L'istinto sessuale ma solo per fini
Suoi...

Tirannica e' la passione
Che ci lega
Da cui dipende la vita
Del genere umano

Si dice sempre che
Che non si vive di solo pane
E noi fregandocene un po
Ci nutrivamo soltanto di sesso

Mentre i nostri sguardi
Si spegnevano
Fra le rovine
Della sessualita'
La natura e' un gioco
Non e' una trappola
Ma non puoi scherzare con lei
Se amando non sei anche una di spirito

I grew up memorizing all the cracks in the wall
Staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
See I prayed every day for a change to be made
And I'd wait to be saved, oh no
Up at night, hiding under covers found my escape
Shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
See I knew I was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing


I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it


Then the universe aligned
With what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls?


Now I wake up to a different bedroom everyday
Living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
Used to sit and watch paint dry
Amazed by the limelight
I can't ever be afraid


I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it


Then the universe aligned
Oh, with what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls?
Oh, the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls


All of the days that I wasted gazing outside the window
Impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
Lied awake at night while my head wandered
And I wondered why
Things weren't different
Everything shifted overnight
Went from ""when boredom strikes"" to ""Ms. Star on the Rise""
It was all in an instant man
But those four pink walls, now I kinda miss them man


Then the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls

Those four pink walls

There's an evening' haze settlin' over the town
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
The place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad


My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
I'm listening' to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it's way into my gut


Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues


Now, I'm sailing' on back, ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall
I'll sell them to their enemies
I'm trying' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away


Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man, no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death




Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me?


Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true, everything you have heard




In you, my friend, I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so


Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means

Too many seeds in the trey bag

With some wild kids from Bucktown, profiling
'Cause the hoochies was starin, thinking ""what them niggas wearing?""

Stickball, humpin hoochies on the wall
Or taking leaks on the steps, stinking up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sipping 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school


""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today

And Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin La Di Da Di

Now I'm not much for games
But I play for keeps
And we salute King James for using his change
To create some equal opportunities


Cold stares can never put the fear in me
There's a movement we've been groovin' on
You can move or stay your ass asleep
Let's just not talk about it
Everything they tried to hide
We're taking back for yours and mine


What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? Coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with? You're coming with me
What about the love
What about the seed? It's coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with? You're coming with me


Okay now
Just don't stay down
Let's go shake down 
Okay now

Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown


Yippee! You can’t see me
But I can you


Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn


No fair, you can’t hear me
But I can you


Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion


Too much, I won’t touch you
But then I might


Screaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone


Hey ho, here we go
Ever so high

One, two, one


Everyday I pray for mankind
We're all slaves to a generation socialized and sickness is in the mind
We are habitual thinkers, substance abusers and habitual drinkers
But free your mind because the plug is watching from the top floor
Hoping you too will fall for the illusions of a temporary high
What we think we need to get by
But are we really trying when kids are dying and depression is trending?
Are these the signs of an Armageddon?
We're all in denial and it's all cool until you're suicidal
We never learn from our so called idols
We're just repeating the cycle so-
I never read the news anymore, it's hard not to feel hopeless
When no one noticed the explosion came from a man who's legal gun was loaded
It's all watered down and sugarcoated
We voted, but did we really get to chose?
We don't need proof that they separate us from the truth
Mothers and fathers are being separated from their youth
And they're selling the American Dream and what it appears to be
But they don't teach us that wealth is unattainable with their currency
History is not my brother's story
The original founders were buried in the ground where men have planted seeds of disease
And they've justified being thieves
Feeding their inner demons and blaming the minorities
It's a World War III, corruption versus greed
Not you versus me
But do we ever think of the need for inner peace?
They can't put a price on your soul
Don't matter your religion, right and wrong is something everybody knows
They pick and choose what's equal
Who's good and who's evil
And this is the devil's world, but the Lord is coming for his people




We're like Daniel in the den
Surrounded by these hungry lions
Looking in the jaws of death
We reach for saving hands
No help will come from men
The Lord is coming


Well the Red Sea's closing in
There's no safety in almighty horses
Can you feel the drivin' wind?
Behold the crashing waves
The Savior's on his way
The Lord is coming


Coming, coming
Hurry, hurry
Bring us to the promise land
Glory, glory
We reach for saving hands
No help will come from men
The Lord is coming


Yeah, uh
See, I know how it feels in a late night
Swimming with the great whites
Drowning in the deep waters
You got three daughters
Could use some resources, nah
We just need order
I got my own bad news, forget a reporter
Man, we ain't even safe, they wanna deport us
Or rather keep us boxed in on the street corners
If you gon' stop and frisk a nigga, shit, at least warn us
My dawg still on probation, they got a leash on us
Far from stupid, in fact, I'm smarter than Harvard students
Sparked a movement and put an end to this garbage music
Got me thinking like this can't be life
Man, y'all idiots, y'all voted for the Antichrist
Living in this false reality
It's in this picture gallery
Based on a nigga's profile
We guess their salary
The lifestyle you advertise, quite strategized
Make a minimal amount and then we maximize
Y'all niggas capping with lies, how they capitalize
Creating their own perception, what a massive facade
Digital marketing schemes, even broader regime
Live how you want on the internet, who thought of this thing?
Now I'm a new man, need to find a new plan
God bless America, God bless Sudan
Now I'm a new man, need to find a new plan
God bless America, and God bless Sudan


Oh, glory, glory, we reach for saving hands
No help will come from men

The Lord is coming

Pain and compassion come in fast, tell me, will it last?
Tomorrow's never promised, so today let's tip the glass
Gold bottles got us rollin' all over the floor 
Threw a party for a looks, I order some more 
Never 'bout the money, truly I just need a purpose 
Help me make it through the dark until he pull the curtains 
Up and downs while I'm climbin' this silly life of mine 
So much pain, so it's champagne until I'm satisfied 
Coach seats, I was just happy we was takin' off 
Went to war, made it back, now time to take it off 
Two chicks, new twist, I wanna taste her lips 
Close her eyes, blew her mind, now let's take a trip

When your world is full of strange arrangements
And gravity won't pull you through
You know you're missing out on something
Well that something depends on you



It takes a lot to love you

You know it's true

There's one thing
Yes, one thing that turns this gray sky to blue



The look of love

The look of love

The look of love


When your girl has left you out on the pavement

When your dreams fall apart at the seams
Your reason for living, your reason for leaving
Don't ask me what it means



I don't know the answer to that question

If I knew I would tell you

Look for your information
Yes, there's one thing, one thing that still hold true




The look of love

The look of love

The look of love





The look of love

The look of love

The look of love



If you judge a book by the cover
Then you judge the look by the lover
I hope you'll soon recover
Me, I go from one extreme to another


And though my friends just might ask me
They say, ""Martin, maybe one day you'll find true love""
I say, ""Maybe there must be a solution
To the one thing, the one thing we can't find""



Sisters and brothers

Should help each other

Ooh, ooh Heavens above

Hip hip hooray

Yippee ai yippee aiay

Be lucky in love

Between a man and woman but between love and love

And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude

Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me ""You've got to play your hand""
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is ""Ain't it a shame""

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on

I get brains on Craftmatics and leave your wet dreams shattered
That's the same guy be skeetin' in your mugshot
I stay hot like summertime on LBQ and boo-boos
The love shack is 1-9-2, my joint's smooth
To watch y'all niggas fall like Lin Que
I keep it brand new like school shoppin', it's on and poppin'
The club peeps this nigga's steez like radars
You get laid off while I'll be gaming ghetto girl like 8-Off

Give up your goods cuz it's the start of your endin'


 We seein' life for what it is
 We get this money for these kids
 We bout to build the foundation



Now, all that Glock totin' trash you talk will not prevail
It's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail
I keep it realer than the logo on milk
Denouncing tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk
That's the sound of the man getting yanked off the stage
Trying to front like he mad paid
Sucking so bad, we threw his mama off the train 
MCs are just givin' it all away 
Who said him know about the Quest-like sound?
Mess around and get your ass knocked down 
I dedicate this to the posers that play hard
You wanna hear some rhymes, well then bring your bodyguard
So he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display
Leaving all MCs in complete disarray
I beez a veteran MC, crushing crews for years
You frontin' hard when you softer than the Berenstain Bears
Yeah, chumps be like ""Phife, that ain't fair""
'Fuck outta here, do I look like I care?
Come off my stage before I grab ya neck and handle ya
Wet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada
Shaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer
Peace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers
I'm cappin' hard cuz I got this rap shit sold
From Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road
You know my steez, I treat hip-hop like a sport
Holdin' down fort up on Martinique Court like...

 We get this money for these kids
 We bout to build the foundation

 Come on, come on

The upper class act like they don't want me on this earth
This life will drive you crazy – only if you allow it
That's only if you a coward, and you're sure to get devoured
To no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power
Who's gonna take a stand? Who's gonna be a man?
Who do you work for? Please help me understand!
You could be the victor in this situation
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's our time, until it's our time


Don't be so afraid to die
Until it's our time
Don't be so afraid to die
It's our time, 'til it's our time
‘Cause we'll never die


Pardon my immortality
I'm Martin Luther shootin' back on the balcony
Escapin' the Lorraine until they call in the cavalry
Alpha 184, oh Lord, nobody blast for me
If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther
Nigga, show me to the slaughter
I gladly sacrifice what is percieved
Sow my seed, so my seed can live its dreams
My spittin' image, see my stitchin' in his genes
Accordin' to my likeness, his breath of life is priceless
My enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans
Penetratin' America's culture to its very being
It's not political, it's more critical
Spiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical
But I advise y'all to keep me alive
In the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life
Beautiful death, nigga!


Tragedy after tragedy, I know it's sad to see
America killin' her babies like Casey Anthony
We try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity
Poppin' ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy
We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace
We promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece
Put down your piece!
I wish you all a beautiful death — peace!

"When I repent that I'm the cover of the magazine
And even thought I know it's all what I wanted
I wish to be beheaded by a guillotine
Make me regret that I'm part of the scene

I am the man, I am the man, I am the madman
I ride the bullet of your everlasting fantasies
I cannot take it, take it, cannot take it anymore
Making me forget my dream

You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

I'm disappointed, I can't get enough adrenaline
Like Yngwie said it, ""You unleashed the fuckin' fury""
I'm crushing Slayer, Corey Taylor like a beat machine
Making you forget they're part of the scene

You wish you had nine to five instead of copying me
You do your Soilwork and yet you adore me
I said it in your face I'm your Arch Enemy
Stop what you're doing and run

You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

Growl god
Growl god

I am your god, I am no saint, I need no fake it
I am the posters on your wall, that's why I set you free
Who is Elize? I have no clue 'cause all I see is me
Make me forget that I am a part of a team

I understand that you are hating my philosophy
The guys behind me ain't no band, they're slaving, slaving, slaving for me
I cannot fake it, fake it, cannot fake it anymore
The fury, the growl god, I roar

You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before!


Are we close enough?
There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes
What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to say


Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record

When this world is trying it's hardest
To leave me unimpressed
Just one caress
From you and I'm blessed

When you think you've tried every road
Every avenue
Take one more look
At what you found old
And in it you'll find something new

I'm shying from the light
I always loved the night
And now you offer me eternal darkness

I have to believe that sin
Can make a better man

That left us back where we began

Her and her friends piled into a Camry
Headed downtown, got in for free
She's all dolled up, looking VIP
Walked in, found a booth, took a seat
Wiped the tear from the corner of her eye
Faked a smile to the Corona guy
Usually she wouldn't give him the time of day
But hey, in here tonight


She don't wanna feel nothing real
She just want somebody to give her attention
For a minute, call her beautiful
She ain't trying to wind up in love
She's just trying to burn some time up
On a Friday night in the neon light
Yeah, he hurt her soul


She just needs a hero to save her
From being all alone
From paying for a drink she don't want
Nothing more than a dance or two
She's feeling blue
But she just needs a hero, mmm
And she just needs a hero


He's all geared up for his football game
He's wearing his jersey with the same last name
A still reminder of the guy that ain't around these days
And his mama's up in them aluminum stands
Saying 'run, baby run', she's his number one fan
Doing the best she can
But wondering why his daddy can't be a better man


He just wants to feel what kids feel
Walking off the football field
After winning, for a minute
In his daddy's pads
The kid should never have to wonder
If his old man even loves him
On a Friday night under Friday lights
Shouldn't be so sad


That should be his hero
That left him and his mama all alone
Barely even calls him on the phone
Every year in March, sends a birthday card
But he just needs a hero, mmm
Yeah, he just needs a hero


There's an old white haired preacher man
With a leather bind good book on the stand
Says 'if you're ready for a change, here's your chance
With every head bow, slip up your hand'


If you wanna feel something real
That this mean old world can't kill
Not even Satan
There's a saviour, he'll wash away your sins
All you gotta do is reap in
Open up your heart, accept him and
He'll save your soul

And everybody needs a hero
Jesus is a hero, ooo
And everybody needs a hero

Don't need their credibility

About standing up and saying that
It's a tragedy, and such old hat

Let's start that rapping thing again

The happy feet are all we need
Summoned the gods and they all agreed
These feet won't stop, they're in such a hurry
Knock it on the head and I go for a curry
Staying sober can be neat
Right down to your happy feet
Keep on trying to pin me down
Why a title for your sound?

Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent
In trodding these roads of trial and tribulations
I've seen where some have died in desperation
To keep

In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto 
Hustling is the only education I know
Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle
A situation like this is getting too hard to handle
To keep

Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, all day long
Fighting against conviction


With a pregnant woman, yes
And five kids to care for
Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town
As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me
I pray the day will come when I shall be free from


Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, oh, live long day
Fighting against conviction


To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury
Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy
Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeon
I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be


Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, oh live long day, now
Fighting against conviction


Now a fugitive at large
Could this be my destiny?
With no one to care for the wellfare of my family
In solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure
For mind and soul would soon be weary
Just couldn't take no more

Fighting against conviction, children, hear me when I say
Battering down sentence, all day long
Fighting against conviction, hear me when I sing my song

And tear a few things down

But we were down to make mistakes

Pop your roof if you act shit

Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

"If there isn't light when no-one sees
Then how can I know
What you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel

Fade away, fade away
Vanish into small
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball

It's the sign
Feels like the time

On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo doesn't answer
When it hears a certain song
Then the Beast is free to wander
But never is seen around

And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Alright, sail away to the sign

From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong

Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Given life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of signs

And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Alright, sail away to the sign
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymore

On a real world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong

It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross

Don't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away
Eight miles high, about to fall
And no-one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The sign of the southern cross

Had to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
How to lean back, fake a yawn
Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss
How to turn a twenty into Saturday night
How to make her momma let you have her til midnight
How not to let her know she's got you caught


These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout a promise and forever
All you know is nothing's better than being together
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl


How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make 'em sound so sweet
That she'd never ever say no, no no no

When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing

And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Oh, you won't believe the way she's got you acting

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive


And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is


That's just the way it is

Did you see that man in the limousine?
With the pretty girl, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill


Did you see that man with a fat cigar?
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer


'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle


In the middle, in the middle, in the middle...


But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend

Shotgun in my daddy's truck
Eight years old and acting tough
He smiled at me and said, ""You shift the gears""
He would search that FM dial
And I would count down every mile
Til the station out of Tulsa came in clear
It was Earl Thomas Conley on the radio
It punched me in the gut, man, it rattled my soul


I'm talking 'bout a good country song
Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word
A good country song
Makes you love, makes you leave
Raise some hell or hit your knees
All I know is I think of home
Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song


While hip-hop, rap, and rock were cool
I was in my basement getting schooled
On George and Keith and Vern and Alabama
I was learning 'bout those neon lights
Wasted days and wasted nights
And honky-tonks from Texas to Montana
And when my fingers found the fret board
I close my eyes and sing
I swear that beat up guitar only played one thing


I'm talking 'bout a good country song
Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word
A good country song
Makes you love, makes you leave
Raise some hell or hit your knees

Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song

Run, laugh, and pray, and drink 'til dawn

He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy
His voice was low with pain
""I'll do your bidding, comrade mine
If I ride back again
But if you ride back and I am left
You'll do as much for me
Mother, you know, must hear the news
So write to her tenderly


""She's waiting at home like a patient saint
Her fond face pale with woe
Her heart will be broken when I am gone
I'll see her soon, I know.""
Just then the order came to charge
For an instance hand touched hand
They said, ""Aye,"" and away they rode
That brave and devoted band


Straight was the track to the top of the hill
The rebels they shot and shelled
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And guarded them as they fell
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again


But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said
Momma, you know, awaits the news
And she'll only know he's dead

What if I said I would break your heart?
What if I said I have problems that made me mean?
What if I knew I would just rip your mind apart?
Would you let me out?


Maybe you can stop before you start
Maybe you can see that I just may be too crazy to love
If I told you solitude fits me like a glove
Would you let me out?


You ought to know where I'm coming from
How I was alone when I burned my home
And all of the pieces were torn and thrown
You should know where I'm coming from


What if I said I was just too young?
What if I said I was built on bricks of carelessness and crumbs?
What if I said I'd be gone before I could come?
Would you let me out?


You ought to know where I'm coming from
How I was alone when I burned my home
And all of the pieces were torn and thrown
You should know where I'm coming from


Your soul outweighs my own, my own
But you turn me away from my low blows
Boy, you should've known


You ought to know where I'm coming from

I felt my heart rate begin to
Choke out the fucking noise like I was cursed
It felt like storms were directly overhead
And where I went it poured


And in a flash came the flood
That washed over my eyes
Now I could see inside the room of the blind
I lost myself inside
And as I fell into the black I left my past to die


Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And let the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder:
Is there anything we could've done?
Why not try, to start a revolution?
And in the morning find a new sunrise
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
As our world ignites!


What will we do? Will we just sit back and watch?
I'm sick of apathy dictating how I think and how I talk
I'd like to know as I lay down to die
I still control the way the think, before they make up my mind
As I gaze up towards the sky
I feel lost in the world of the blinding lights
We all hope to reach these heights
But we're all so afraid of the fall
No one will take the fall
We're all so comfortable with living in our sheltered homes
No one will take the fall
But if we try, we could all change the world


Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And let the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder:
Is there anything we could've done?
Why not try to start a revolution?
And in the morning find a new sunrise
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down



We are gathered here today as brothers and sisters
Not bound by fate
But by the understanding that our survival
Lies only in harmony


We, have only one life to live
And then we're cast into the night
Will you carry the torch and
Be the keeper of the light?!
Or will you let darkness fall?!
Or will you let darkness fall?!
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world



Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world...
And let the stars fall down...

Can I hide the scars? Just like prison bars

Is there time left for revival?
Can I be convinced that some hope exists?
With these wounds cut so deep in my soul
Can we become whole?

One time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walking to World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kind of words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
""I wouldn’t worry about it none, though
Them old dreams are only in your head""


I said “Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain”
He said “Nurse, get your pad, the boy’s insane”
He grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!”
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said “Tell me about it”


Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast
It was all over by a quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on us


Well, I got up and I walked around
Up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road
It was a normal day


Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I give a yell
“Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”
A shotgun fired, and away I ran
I don’t blame him too much though, he didn't know me


Down at the corner by the hot-dog stand
I seen a man
I said “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”
He screamed a bit, and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist


Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
I said “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”
I took her by the hand, and my heart was thumping
When she said “Hey man, you crazy or something?
You seen what happened last time they started”


Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown
There was nobody around
I got into the driver’s seat
And I drove down 42nd Street
In my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war


Well, I remember seeing some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn’t pay the Con Ed bill
So the radio didn’t work so well
Turned on my record player —
It was Rock-a-day Johnny, singing “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Love’s A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”


I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
“When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up


Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Saying “Hey I’ve been having the same old dreams
But mine was a little different, you see
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me
I didn’t see you around""


Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody’s having them dreams
Everybody sees their self
Walking around with no one else


""Half of the people can be part right all of the time
And some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time""

“I’ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours”

Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? 
God level, I am the ""I Am"" 
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic 
2016, burnt some discs
2017, ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique, on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, ""Issa knife"" 
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting 
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick 
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really all


I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel


It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind


V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by they selves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth


I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel


My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards 
Amazing the cash online unknown 
Blazing the dash counting money at home

Our lives are factual and actual
Plus you natural and match well
Burdens on my back look like a shell
Purple act, I'm moving like a snail
Both sides even like equal
Both eyes gleaning like a scale
Green and blue, hundreds turning teal
Green and blue, money colored tales
Was such a good guy to Chanel
'Til she caught me sleeping with Charel
The Range, Royce, ring, like Pharrell
Bling so she see that I'm for real
Picture me, a fire burn in Hell
Photography like David LaChapelle
Black lapels and nappy ponytail
Make 'em call me Flacko Lagerfeld

See on both sides like Chanel

Entertain me
For the tenth hour in a row again
Anesthetize me
With your gossip and many random anecdotes
And fill every hour
With activity or ear candy
Drop me off
At intersections in any city metropolitan


And keep me in this state
And keep me purgatorying
And sing me back to sleep
This is far more than I had bargained for


Start every week
With a break-neck urgent design
And end every speed day
With my briefcase representing free time
Spending my fruits
My purchases become my lifeline
Please, give my love to my family
I'll doubtfully be home at Christmas time


Don't disturb me in this state
Please, leave me purgatorying
I'll be damned if I'm to wake
This is far more than I am equipped for


I've held you up like a deity
Like you're the sole owner of wings
This unrequited tunnel vision
And I wonder why I've not been writing


Please, keep me in this state
Please, keep me purgatorying
Please, rock me back to sleep
This love is more than I had bargained for
I'll be damned if I'm to wake
This is far more than I am equipped for

Money callin', we all in
I don't do fake shit, that's borin'
It's all been in God's plan
I don't do lame shit, that's borin'


It was all love, wasn't always that way
Face card on ""Welcome back""
Face card on ""How you been?""
Face card on ""Everybody gotta pay, except for you""
I need like 21 cards, she ask, okay it's the crew


I need security and shit
I make investments to live
I need that ice on my wrist
But I just might, lil' bitch

But I just might, lil' bitch
Just might, lil' bitch
This life I live
Runnin' late to the lab
Be there 'bout 6
Still plans, move slow
Just like my flow
Got a verse from 2 Chainz but ain't bought one
But just might, lil' ho


It was all love, wasn't always that way

30 blocks to Fordham Road
That’s a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn’t do what it is I could


The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away


I don’t know why it is that I wanna stay
I don’t know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I’m not gonna do what I hear me say
I’m just gonna walk, I’m gonna walk away


I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There’s a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cents
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it’s always nighttime
And I like it when it’s me at night
‘Cause that’s when all the stars come out
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh


I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say

Let me show you, the rhyme..
Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses
And so does Mrs. Justice by her side
Both the broads are blind as bats, stumblin through - the system
Justice bumped into M'Tulu, trippin on Geronimo Pratt
But stepped right over Oliver and his crooked partner Ronnie
Justice stubbed her big toe on Mandela
And Liberty was misquoted by the Indians
Slavery was just a learning phase, forgotten without a verdict
While Justice is on a rampage
For endangered survivin black males
I mean really; if anyone REALLY valued life
And cared about the masses
They'd take 'em both to Pen Optical
And get TWO pairs of glasses

Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses
I'm kickin asses up and down New York City
It's a pity
Brothers wanna be grimy and gritty to each other
What would your mother think, smotherin your brother?
I see you sink, into another level
Dancin with the devil
Turn up the bass, cause I'm player; also a rhyme sayer
Kind of fly, layer after layer
Why.. cause I'm blessed
Cause I've progressed
I've learned my lessons
Class has always been in session, so you better take notes
And stop chokin on negativity

Nothing like Bobby Shmurda's but I congratulate him
More like a gangsta lean let's get this picture painted
Drop it low then pick it up before you hit the pavement

Now nigga make up your mind you gonna rap or sell dope
I was followed like crazy this rapper life a pillow
But don't sleep on this nigga because I'm hard as brillo
Nigga I ain't no game, I never played Nintendo
Through puberty, I was popping pussy and popping pimples
Popping cuties with heavy booties and pretty dimples

I was at Abyssinian playing basketball
But it was different from playing basketball at the park
Cause at the park the Dominicans had the packs of raw

Uh gotta catch em' all like the theme song
I ain't Morgan Freeman, ain't no one to lean on
I'm a dope dealer, on a dope walk
Now the sky turn to blue gotta get this dope off
They’re like Menace II Society with O-Dog
Now the fiends leaning like he bout to touch his toe dog, look y'all
I'm the dope lord and y'all my fiends, y'all wanted this all your life
I’ve been coming up with hits like constantly, and you know my shit’s so tight

And I don't think that that's a selfish want, I really don't. I'm not saying that I have this capacity because it's hard to develop that capacity on your own, when you're being stopped at every turn


Drive around, night time, nowhere to go
Melt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes
Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low
And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this


Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you


Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it


Show me joy, flower through disarray
Let's destroy, each mistake that we made
Then restore the color back to the grey
There's no pride in sharing scars to prove it


Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you


Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it


Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness


Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it
Oh my lover, my lover, my love

I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection


I'm a ninja, yo
My life is like a video game
I maintain when I'm in the zone
One player, one life on the mic limited time 
No fucking around I'm cutting down anyone in my path
Trying to fuck with my game with razor sharp lyrical throw stars
Here my flow's hot
Ho$$tyle
Wild, out of control
Ninja skop befokte rof taal
Rough rhymes, tough times
Met fokol kos, skraal
Till I hit triple seven at the ATM
Straight famine or feast
When you living on the razor edge
Stay sharp sharp
Rolling with the $0$
High energy
You never seen Zef so fresh
Uh! When we mic check Hi-Tek flows flex
Yo we optimistic, not fuckin' depressed
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
Totally unknown
You can't fuck with my new Zef flow
I'm hard to miss
""You can't do this, you can't do that""
Yo, fuckin' who said so?
I do what I like
Too hot to handle
Too cold to hold
You can't fuck with the chosen one
I-I-I-I-I want the knife
Yo I'm a Ninja


I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection

Ninja is poes cool
But don't fuck with my game, boy
Or I'll poes you
Life is tough when I get stuck
And my time is up I push through
Till I break-break-break on through to the other side
Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker
Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain it's not sore
Don't ask for kak or you'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive
My blades swing free
Decapitate a hater
With amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage from the dark side danger!
Yin to the yang
Totally Hi-Tek, Ninja's motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a microphone, big dreams, and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja


I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection


Fuck this is like...
The coolest song I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn't make it
They said I was a loser
They said I was a no-one
They said I was a fucking psycho
But look at me now, all up in the interweb, world wide
2009, futuristic
Enter the Ninja

Hey there, you nasty boy, it’s been a minute
And I could say my life has changed since you hit it
This is your strongest trait, you work the middle
While they say I’m sprung, I say ""Baby, you did it""


They say you a baller, I hear you’re just a player
And all my friends tell me I should have never dated
But now I’m in love with you and I’mma have to tell ‘em
Quit hatin’ on him, don’t be jealous



I’m into you boy, it can be

Boy this don’t mean that I gotta be

Had to take my friend home
My girls, nowhere without my girls, baby


Hey, first I seen you in a Beemer, and then I saw the Lexus
I knew about the Benzes, with the 20-inch rims on ‘em
And a lot of ex-girlfriends, I bet they still calling
Well I can’t say I blame ‘em, cause you have something


They say you a baller, I hear you’re just a player

I'm out on the highway
Just about a mile away
Meet me out in the driveway
I'm gonna be there soon
I'll swing by and pick you up
Don't bother getting fixed up
Me and you and this old truck
Will find something to do


No, I ain't got no plan in mind
It's such a perfect night
So I just thought
That we could go get lost


Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere
Is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost


Come on baby let's go
When we get there we'll know
No bars on the cellphone
Sounds good to me
We can find us a place to park
By the water underneath the stars
And do a little ""fishin' in the dark""
If you know what I mean


Well all we need's a tank a gas
So grab that GPS
And turn it off
Let's go get lost

Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder feelin' kinda older I tripped the
Merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope
Crashed to the ground


Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot snappin' his fingers clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers daddy's within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band


And she was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright


Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
He says, ""Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least""
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance


Yeah, he was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but she never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight


Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said I'll turn you on sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came in by her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride


Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier
Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card
He said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground
Asked him which was the way back home
He said take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then boy, you're on your own


And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw
A gap but figured he'd be all right


He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Woah, but but mama that's where the fun is


I was blinded
Oh mama, oh mama

Oh mama, oh mama

Catch you in traffic, you sitting Daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins

Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album


A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nickle plated
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures


I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah


I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches


I can make it bounce by myself

I'm just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squadered my resistance
For a pocketful of numbles
Such are promises, all lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest


When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know


Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there


Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home


In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still ramains

"I hear the sound in a metal way
I feel the power rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be

Baby, I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screaming guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby, I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

Living like there's no tomorrow
Currie says we're on the edge
He says, man you're really graphic
This band's a social wedge
We all got hearts made of metal
And our blood's hot molten rock
And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

So mister D.J., play just one for me
You know the one with the crushing
And the screams
Cause only one thing really sets me free

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?


I'm your national anthem, God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"", he said, ""Yes, yes, yes…""


Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem


Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss


I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?



Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem


It's a love story for the new age, for the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel


Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress


I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up, give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon


Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

And a one time tramp
And an old time movie star

Of the pickiest kind
But you always find the ones to keep

And in or out of bed
You keep you're head wide open
'cause ya don't only dream when you're asleep

Like a child ... you remember
But I forget ... all my dreams

I used to think
That someday I'd relax a little
And be more like you

Then I realized
How silly that thought was
Needed to stand in my own shoes

And from over here
I can see you cry
Don't even try ... to pretend

'cause he's hurt you
So many times
Baby don't go back again

But I remember everything..and every sting

And through all the games

Through the fat and thin

I'm gonna change my life
Until it's just as tiny or
Important as you like
And in time, we won't even recall that we spoke
Words that turned out to be as big as smoke
Like smoke, disappears in the air
There's always something smouldering somewhere

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me
You'll see me off in the distance, I hope

I dreamt that the world was flat
And all the colours bled away
And that was that
And in time, I could only believe in one thing
The sky was just phosphourus stars hung on strings
And you swore that they'd always be mine
When you can pull them down anytime

Lie down, baby, your vision is blurred
Your head is so sore from all of that thinking
I don't want to hurt you now
But I think you're shrinking 

You're half-naked ambition and
You're half out of your wits
And though your wristwatch always works
Your necktie never fits
Now it's so hard to pick the receiver up
And when I call, I never noticed you could be so small
The answer was under your nose
But the question never arose

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me
When you find me here at the end of my rope
When the head and heart of it finally elope
You can see us off in the distance, I hope

Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'


We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone 
We should be drinking alone, together 


I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should


We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone 
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone 
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone


I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home


We should be drinking alone 
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone  together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone 
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone

The last time I smoked, I think it was about a pound
I thought Lou laced my weed, I was about to pan 'em out
And he told me quietly, ""Nigga, you was on the loud""
I was running 'round the room, Rocky tried sat me down
I went to club with, and I seen Busta Rhymes with the red neck
And he looking at me like, ""Nigga, you sniffed a line?""
You heard this before, you probably would have lost your mind
But I had to change my lines cause TT didn't like my rhymes
Everybody always giving praise to the team
When all my niggas do is get fly and sip lean
Niggas think we're stupid, with all these designer things
We walk in Hilfigers office and hear that ching-ching
We get paid from Tommy the rest of y'all niggas silly
And walk in office meetings with camoflauge and a philly
And only get brain from the bitches that know the dealy
She rocked the mic and killed lipsync like Milly Vanilli


Being broke be the best thing that happened to me
It give me hunger pain, something strange happened to me
It fills my brain up with things so imaginary
Then I start to spit flames with vocabulary
My momma thought I wouldn't make it with this rapping shit
Lint in my pockets and I still ain't ask for shit
Dreams of traveling the world so lav-er-ish
Fuck a couple bitches that be fucking with them tab-a-lets
Lean sip' fabrics, you nigga is average
I'm about a mothafuckin' buck like Maverick
Fucking hoes in palaces, posing for the cameras
Fans scream, ""Lord!"" like a mothafuckin' catholic
Hoes tryna snap a pic, while a nigga tapping it
Bitches love my words, on stage they try to grab my dick
I'm the best when it comes to this rapping shit
I eat a nigga sleeping like bed bugs in mattresses
Still up in the hood with them stragglers
Fourty calibers if a nigga talking blasphemous
Young Trap Lord, I'm going back to Nazereth
Lean got me slurring like I got Ty Nast's lisp


Excellent weekends are with kinky whores
Flow like meteor, your mediocre retard, put you in the ER
No CPR to bring you back, when I pull out this Eagle
Squeeze her like kegel, sitting in a Regal
Blaze a blunt of sour, now I'm higher than a seagull
Never ever pass unless you're on of my amigos
'bout to have a trio, call that shit a sequel
Me fucking these hoes, we listening to Beanie Sigel
Ain't no way you're equal, nigga why you hating?
It's over for 30 seconds like gang initiation
Put dots between 'em like abbreviation
Put his ass to sleep like sed-ed-ation
I done came up from dinner bowl and cereal
To bitches want the pipe like a house of payne video
So Ferginstine tell 'em get up on there grind
When that A$AP drop, bring it back home for Brown

We are each other’s hemispheres
I am fine tuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance


Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation
Learning by love to open it up
Let this ugly wound breathe
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance


When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me
We are each other’s hemispheres


We aim at peeling off
Dead layers of loveless love
No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Most hearts, they fear their own home
Becoming themselves fully
It scares them off


When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me


No one is a lover alone, lone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
The atoms are dancing, dancing


No one is a lover alone, lone
Most hearts fear their own home

'Bout to bar niggas flows 'cause they rep ain't there

Come no closer, got the game in a choka, blunt smoker
Pretty hair, cunt stroker, it's Brooklyn baby

From the era where the real niggas ball took cheddar
Broads even look much better I put pleasure
And stitch in every word

No fear of what's to come

Standing against the sun

After the fire, after the flames
Nothing will feel the same

I'm ready to dream again, surviving what left me for dead
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove I could feel love without end
I'm all that I have. I am the aftermath!

Show it no mercy, cause it cannot hurt me
No more will I bite my tongue
Tired of worthless fighting with purpose
No longer will I stay numb

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand


Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream


The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Myth exposed and pain magnified, the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused to see you so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see you welcome defeat
When your hero falls so league the stars, and so does the perception of tomorrow
Without my hero, there's only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls

Roadblock, roadblock baby
Roadblock, roadblock baby




Let me tell ya she's a roadblock baby, great big barricade
But once I pass her, you know we're gonna have it made
We'll have it made


Roadblock, roadblock baby

Well hop in the hack
Turn on the key
Pop in the clutch
Let the wheels roll free


Come on honey, let me sing them away
Come on honey, let me sing them away
Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away


Give me a little of that old time love
Cause i ain't never had near enough
Honey, walk that walk with style and grace
This ain't no knock-down drag-out race
It don't matter much, pick any gear
Brind you a pound and drop the rear
Baby, baby what can i say
I'm here to drive those blues away
I sent a letter to a man i know
Said, ""one for the money and two for the show.""
I wait all summer for his reply
Said, ""three to get ready and four to fly.""
Only two things in the world i love
That's rock 'n' roll and my turtle dove
When i was a young man i needed good luck
But i'm a little bit older now and i know my stuff

Eat a dick up





Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggas with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, cause either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore ... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your ... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna ... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin up spots and jumpin in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin
And always keep a hand on the gat
Cause a niggas straight strugglin'





I'm used to being poor, but now I'm sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin'





Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggas on they back
Till I call back, niggas running free better fall back
I'm fifty niggas deep beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my sheets
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon
Niggas need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggas ass, blast
Straight strugglin'

And so the story goes, they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the goodmen tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicely shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss


Sighing they swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions


I was stone and he was wax
So he could scream and still relax
Unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru our veins and lo! It was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote cannot be found today


And it was stalking time for the moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
And the Devil may be here
But he can't sing about that
Oh, and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers


Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead, he could be not, he could be you
He's chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature


Shooting up pie-in-the-sky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone
Kings of oblivion
We were so turned on
In the mind-warp pavilion


Lay me place and bake me pie
I'm starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey

Just for the day, hey
Please come away, hey
Just for the day, hey
Please come away, hey

Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like me
But I got to think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play 'cause I play them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you the door


Well, I gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!


Baby I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please, don't go away
'Cause you're giving me the blues
Baby, your mind made all the word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy blues
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you that door


Well, I gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Get the fuck up!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!

"If only you were here
To hold my head above bloody waters
We could make it through
You turned your back on me
And now I do the same to you

You made me feel so hollow
How can the man that you looked up to
Turn around and say three words
That hurt more than you'll ever know

You don't know what it feels like to be in my shoes

You turned your back on me as I stood there and fell to the floor
You turned your back on me as I stood there and fell to the floor

This time there's no reason for me
To turn around and scream for help

But if only you were here
To hold my head above all those things you said to tie me down
I'm looking for forgiveness for something that I didn't even do

How can you call yourself an idol
A person to trust?
How can I look so high up to you when you're always holding me down?
How can I look up so high when you're holding me down?

Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasure remains
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever needed

"Another cold dark night, left alone
Your arrogance will lead to the death of you
I'll be the one to pull your head back down
Remove your hollow crown
So far from the truth you hide away
I'll be the one to pull your head back down
Remove your hollow crown
I'll die happy knowing that I will never be anything like you
What gives you the right to silence me?
All my life I've wanted just to feel like this
You came, you conquered you gave it away
And how does it feel staring down on your idol's grave
The one you once looked up to has fallen into dust
The one you once looked up to has fallen away
What's left for you in this fickle world?
Remove your crown

You would never lie to a friend

Tickin' tickin' into the future

This is getting old and so are you
Everything you know and never knew
Will run through your fingers just like sand
Enjoy it while you can


Like a snake between two stones
It itches in your bones
Take a deep breath and swallow
Your sorrow
Tomorrow


So raise it up and let's propose a toast
To the thing that hurts you most


It's your last cup of sorrow
What can you say?
Finish it today
It's your last cup of sorrow
So think of me
And get on your way


It won't begin
Until you make it end
Until you know the how the where and the when
With a new face you might surprise yourself


Like a snake between two stones
It itches in your bones
Take a deeper breath and swallow
Your sorrow
Tomorrow






You might surprise yourself

I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice

The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls
Signal back from satellite
As my life
Flashes right in front of me

Try again
Must get through
Hear me now
For I've very little time

Not much time
Hear my call
Please get through
I am here


I'm stranded in space
I'm lost without trace
I haven't a chance of getting away

Too close to the sun
I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes

I think of my life
Reliving my past
There's nothing but wait till my time comes

I've had a good life
I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time afresh


For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

If I could survive
To live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all

Done more in my life
Than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again



There isn't much time
Must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me

Must say my goodbyes
If only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find



The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
