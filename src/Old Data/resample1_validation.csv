Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed


And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl


Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, ""Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?""
And Daddy said, ""You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye""


But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American


And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, ""Be honest, tell me what you want""
And he said, ""Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American""


Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl


All-American girl

Betty told Dupree, wanted a diamond ring
Betty told Dupree, wanted a diamond ring
Dupree said Betty ""Boy I'd do most anything.""


Got him a pistol, was a .44
Got him a pistol, was a .44
Get that ring for Betty, Dupree used to rob the town store


Police got Dupree, put him around to jail
Police got Dupree, put him around to jail
Sent for his Betty, come and get his bail


Well she came to him but his face she could not see
She came to him but his face she could not see
Said to the Warden, give him this love for me


They said I came to see you but I cannot see your face
I came to see you but I cannot see your face
Just want to tell you, no ones gonna take your place

"How wrong am I for gettin' over you?
How wrong am I for playin' the same old fool?
How wrong are you for playin' with my heart?
I guess being lonely is a mighty good place to start

So baby don't mind those empty sheets
Where you and I used to be
You made the bed in which you sleep
They say hindsights twenty-twenty
Well maybe now you'll see
I've always been the man you thought I'd never be

Baby I've always been right in front of your eyes
Waitin' on you to change your mind
But that day has come and gone and I'm sorry you're left behind
I wanna thank you for lettin' me see the light in someone else's eyes

So baby don't mind those empty sheets
Where you and I used to be
You made the bed in which you sleep
They say hindsights twenty-twenty
And maybe now you'll see
I've always been the man you thought I'd never be

Well I hope your nights get longer layin' in that lonely bed
And I hope your sheets get colder relivin' a love that's already dead
And I hope you've found what you're lookin' for and all your selfish pride
'Cause baby you'll be the only one losin' any sleep tonight

So baby don't mind those empty sheets
Where you and I used to be
You made the bed in which you sleep
They say hindsights twenty-twenty
Well maybe now you'll see
I've always been the man you thought I'd never be
Oh you thought I'd never be

"I get tired of life
What a world I'm living in
Now I've got it all
Been enough, I'm giving in

The sun is shining, melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning, this is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day

A king for a day

Stuck in this toxic town
Really takes my breath away
It's either leave or drown
I'm on a  blue sky getaway

The sun is shining, melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning, this is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day

A king for a day

The sun is shining, melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning, this is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day

You're the best thing yet
To ever come into my life


An understanding hand
When the world calls me grand
You protect my heart
Right from the start

Sensitive vibes
Are strong and true
The very best
I've always shared with you

And if I should fall
Or if I'm stading tall
I can see you standing there
Always willing to share
Each and every part of me
You see things I never, never see




Deep down in my mind
I wonder at the blessing that I could find
Someone as loving as you
Could bring into my life
This feeling so right and so true

Like the flowing waters of a sliver stream
And like the misty vision in a midnight dream
Such a wonder of life to me
So rare is found such a reason to be




Like the flowing waters of a silver stream
And like the misty vision in a midnight dream
Such a wonder of life to me
So rare is found such a reason to be




You're so wonderful
You're so beautiful
You're the best thing yet
To ever come into my life

Can't you hear them whispering
Around you all the time
Can't you tell the difference between
Things when you're in love
I hear your voice is trembling
Every time when he's around
Your detached engagements
In the things I say means love, oh


He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad


If he doesn't love you you're afraid that you can't go on
Living without loving never makes a person strong, no
If he really loves you let him show you that instead
I will be here with you 'cause I know that you're afraid of love


He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad


You'll never change my mind my friend, don't let that feeling go
This love might change your world around
In time you'll have to know, oh yeah


Whether you should go
Oh, yeah
He decides whether you should smile

Cold blue rain
I don't wanna think about it
Same old place
Makes me wanna think about it
See your face
Remembering that I'm mad about you
So why embrace, All the things that you do?


I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
Our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun
I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
Our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun


Cold blue rain
I don't wanna think about it
Same old place
That I won't ever want to leave
Feel your face
Knowing that I'm mad about you
So why embrace
Make me feel like my dreams come true


I know that we'll be forever
Forever together as one
Our hearts will share the same shelter
We share a place under the same sun

Forever together as one

I play the clown for you
Entertaining, absurd hue
As I watch them laugh, I'd love to
See them clap and dance to my tune


Blowing up like a red giant, expansive, a star
And I'm coming to burn this down and laugh my ass off


All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winnin' 'em over
Amen


I act on stage up here
Toying with your own fears
Misdirection I'm so near
Simple sleight of hand, in the clear


Blowing up like a red giant, expansive, a star
And I'm coming to burn this down and laugh my ass off


All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winnin' 'em over

Too late now, show's over
Real life is much closer
Take the make up off, you wonder
Why I look the same, only bolder

All my children, sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winnin' 'em over

'Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till


Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
They said they had a reason, but I can't remember what
They tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street


Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie
Was just for the fun of killing' him and to watch him slowly die


And then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind


I saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see
The smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea


If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow
For you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!


This song's just a reminder to remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give
We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live

Snow falling on the window-sill

Greatest time of your life from me

I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself while the children sleeps

Hooray!

I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it
My face is drawn, my instinct still emotes it


I slashed them cold, I killed them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues


It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians


I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red

Caesars have squandered jewels on you
Empires they build on shifting sands
Trading for kisses in a queue
Like sacrificial lambs
Let Rome in Tiber melt away
Legions that conquer rise then fall
I'll kneel to the gods and then I'll pray
Do you hear my call?


You came you saw you conquered me
Right then I knew you wanted me
Burning in flames of desire
Burning in flames of desire
You came you saw you taunted me
High Priestess powers anointed me
This is the torch, this is the flame
This is the passion wild and untamed
Burning in flames of desire


The spirit of romance in your smile
Sweeping me back two thousand years
To bath in the waters of the Nile
In Cleopatra's tears
Together we sail cross dessert seas
Is it true? Is it deja-vu?
It whispers in the breeze
Do you feel it too?

Well I've been wondering what I've been missing
I guess I should have known
But my heart does and it isn't whispering
It tells me just what it wants


Someone who knows what I like in my coffee
And the shape of my old hat
A lover who always looks at me not through me
I need a love like that


I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
I need a love like that


Well I need a new car but I can't afford it
So I keep patching that old flat
My heart's lonely and I can't ignore it
I need a love like that




Two young people dancing in the daylight
They don't care where they're at
Waiting on sunset holding on so tight
I need a love like that




One little baby hiding in the shadow
Of her daddy's hat
Loving and trusting blindly she'll follow
I need a love like that

A long time ago was a cloud over heaven filled with evil and snow
Came from the place where the voices were calling, a long long time to go
Fire and water, the wind and the rain, silence is filling the air
Blessed by the dark and the master is calling, you better be aware


But the blind leading the blind, any fool can hear the chime
When the reaper cries, the spell is gone, you're on a magical ride
But the blind leading the blind, any fool can hear the chime
When the reaper cries, the spell is gone, you're on a magical ride


Earls of black flying high, coming through the darkened sky
Earls of black, and they feel no surrender
Earls of black, flying high, coming through the darkened sky
Earls of black, and they feel no surrender
Earls of black


Castles and kings, demons with wings, only the strong will survive
Don't turn your back on the light, the evil's in disguise
Crystal light falling down from the sky, is there a place where it's burning
Oh they say it's a mystery, no chance of returning


But the blind leading the blind, any fool can hear the chime
When the reaper cries, the spell is gone, you're on a magical ride
But the blind leading the blind, any fool can hear the chime

Big up to my amigo, he gave me a kilo for my ego
Talking 'bout you popped the molly? You just took you a placebo
And my suit is Valentino, she is hot as jalapeno
I can do a drive-by listening to Bobby Valentino
I can make her ass wiggle, I can get some cash with her
Talking 'bout your ex-boyfriend, fuck you and your last nigga
You ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking 'bout us
Saying something in the air, y'all bitches some ones
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Have you ever got some head while driving in reverse?
I ain't into backing up, but just in case I'm backing out
Now look how she reacting, now I put it in, she asking ow




Big up to my lil sweet ho, my lil petite ho, keep it a C-note
When my main ho act like a P.O, ain't that frio, that's Sub-Zero
I say one time for that bitch, who just want dick and some to eat
Only want a number three, that's my pussy custody
I want a slim fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got no nosy friends, just a purse with her
She ain't got a lot of ass but I can work with her
Nigga, that's my cup of tea, ahh, burnt my tongue
Ooh, she got a popcorn booty
Everytime I see that ass it make me wanna watch a movie
It's supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerking going on?

Beneath the floor and never greens
That kept the ridge on high
There lives a green-eyed mountain girl
That stole my heart one night
She loved me like I never knew
And chased me down below
To never feel her touch again
Or taste that mountain snow


That Appalachian Mountain Girl
That haunts me from above
My heart will never beat the same
Without her mountain love


I often wake up late at night
Dreaming about her
Then walked on the floor until morning comes
And hope she will return


That Appalachian Mountain Girl
That haunts me from above
My heart will never beat the same
Without her mountain love


Sometimes the wind will blow just right
And I think I can smell
The flowers that headlined the road
That led me to this hell


That Appalachian Mountain Girl
That haunts me from above
My heart will never beat the same
Without her mountain love
That Appalachian Mountain Girl
That haunts me from above
My heart will never beat the same
Without her mountain love

Get loose, if you know you got that truth
Say I'm not a slave don't take no abuse
Get loose, ever since you got that truth
You and God got a truce, set aside for His use
Get loose  


Everybody get loose we free from chains
Since the day we was born we was evil man
Being slaves was the norm then Jesus came
Now we stray from the norm, He redeemed us man
Not in prison of our sinning homie we been changed
In the end we'll be presented with Him free from blame
All because of what He did we live in freedom man
But it's s-so whack how we g-go back
Back to the past like th-throwbacks
We ain't 'posed to act like that o-old cat
We in sin acting like we can't h-hold back
We ain't gotta act sick, we don't have to switch
Lil' homie go and check Romans chapter six
Think we gotta act bad? Nah that's a trick
Don't pick sin as your master to crack the whip




Yeah freedom was the reason He set us free
Yeah the Lord Christ Jesus the best you'll see
Get to know Him, behold Him, I guess you'll see
Any hour more power than a SUV
Yeah enough to make cats that always look to sin
Make them write whole verses and hooks to Him
Make them unfoolish students of the book like Him
Make them walk like, talk like, and look like Him
I feel s-so free, He got a hold on me
And it's no way I'm going to the o-old me
Since I'm freed from deeds how I'm posed to be
Man I'm staying close and praying that He m-molds me
I'm running from my sin 'cause I'm free from that
But every now and then I feel myself creeping back
Then I run to the Word where Jesus at
And pray He'll lead my life and be pleased with that




Nah we ain't gon' take that no more
In sin and your growth on slow mo
No more drank, no dro to blow
Trying to push you to the Lord that's what I flow for 
So bro, let's celebrate we free dog
Sin ain't got a hold on me dog
Running back to the Lord when we fall

Go Houston, get loose now
Go Memphis, get loose now

And pensively stood by his tomb
When in a low whisper I heard something say:
How sweetly I sleep here alone

The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
The tears are all wiped from my eyes

The call of my master compelled me from home
No kindred or relative nigh
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high

Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone

Has kindly assisted me home

He set out with a backpack
A compass in hand
To steal Mona Lisa
And that was his plan
A modern day outlaw
He'll take what he can
And vanish before you
Like tracks in the sand


His pockets were full but his heart was so heavy
And all these material things can be deadly if
No one is there who will share when you're seventy-one


If only someone
Filled the spaces
He might settle down


He met her on Tuesday
On his way back from France
He rolled up the painting
He stole with his hands
And even Da Vinci
Couldn't have sketched
A more perfect woman
Than the one that he met


His pockets were full but his heart was so heavy
And all these material things can be deadly if
No one is there who will share when you're seventy-one


If only someone
Filled the spaces
He might settle down


Settle down, settle down, settle down, settle down


He woke up in the morning
With nothing around
She left with the portrait
No trace of her found
She was the outlaw
She was the one
She took the bounty
And left him with none


His pockets aren't full and his heart is still empty
And falling in love, it can be just as deadly
And no one is there who will care when he's seventy-one

Filled the spaces
He might settle down

You've been my muse for a long time
You get me through every dark night
I'm always gone, out on the go
I'm on the run and you're home alone
I'm too consumed with my own life


Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move


Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down


I've been confused as of late 
Watching my youth slip away 
You're like the sun, you wake me up
But you drain me out if I get too much
I might need you or I'll break


Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move


Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart

I would have never crossed that line

And right now, girl, I can't change the way I'm feeling


You said that we should be friends
But girl, my heart can't take that

Inside of my chest is so numb
When I think about what we could have done
Girl, tell me what are you running from
No one could ever love you like I do


I remember all the stories you told me 
And all them lames that you used to date
You know it's not me 
And all them rainy days I held you in my arms
While you cried , cried , cried 
I was always the one there for you
I guess I fell for you too deep 
And i can't believe you saying this to me 
You think we should we...

The lady is dying
She bends back like a wave
As her spirit is climbing
Through the hospital wall and away
And I wanted to hold you
As you made your escape
But now I should have told you
When your eyes were alive and awake
Always in life we all must make this mistake


And so I go it alone
And the pressure is great
I hold on to my own
Oh please, oh don't go away


I wanted to know you
Before you started to fade
But I gave everything to
A lie and a farce and a fake
Always in life we all must make this mistake


And so I go it alone
And the pressure is great
I hold on to my own
Oh please, oh don't go away
I'd like to see you when all of these angry days flow away

Like the poison running through your veins
You're addicted to the pain and the shame
Chasing the same game every day
Hooked on all your bullshit and your vanity


Blind decisions, no regrets
A bittersweet of toxic sweat

Never answers, but in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses, 'cause in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Oh, you're gonna say my name


A normal situation in disguise
Dragging me through your self-inflicted lies
Too bad you're never gonna win this game
Your misery's your only friend and you're to blame

"Darling you were looking good
When you came to me
And asked for a dance
And I said,""We can dance.""
Felt like a queen
Swedish summer nights are hot
And the trees can talk
We lay on the grass
So easily, so blessed
Whispers in blindness
And I didn't hold you back

I'm talking about it 
'Cause you've been teasing me
I'm talking about it
'Cause you are bad right through
Stay with me and I shall want no other love
Stay with me another love another lie

Stay with me and I shall want no other love
You were talking so sweet
But you were touching and teasing

I can hear the soft bells ring
Through a thousand years
They call out to me
They say it's only once in a life we love
Now I've had that honor too
You were holding my hand
You were kissing my skin
Stay with me
Trees are whispering
Only once my dear

Another day of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
I fade away, lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine


I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible


Wasted days, dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
Seems I just lost track
Looking on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey
I just walked away


I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Well good God o'mighty this week's been two months long
Lord I love to hear that Friday five o'clock whistle moan
As the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Put the juice to my truck I head into town
Get it on and go to grooving to the redneck rhythm & blues


Life ain't all hard knocks a quarter in the jukebox
Turn it on and set 'em up Joe
Songs about a workin' man blarin' from a bandstand
Is music to a country boy's soul
Call me the underdog of overtime
I stay broke all the time
Gotta pay the eight to five dues
Well I'm hillbilly hardcore
Son I'm a sucker for the redneck rhythm & blues


There's nothing worse than the rattle and roll of empty cans
Bouncin' around in the bed of my truck
Boy I'm a thirsty man
Five hot long miles to the waterin' hole
I got the pedal to the metal singin' go cat go
Aw a cool one is a cure for the redneck rhythm & blues




Yeah I'm hillbilly hardcore

I made the mistake, go writing your name on my heart
'Cause your colors showed
But it was too late, you left me stained, called it art
Do you crave control?
I've been your doll, that you poke for fun too long
So you should go
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more


Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone
Alone, alone


There ain't no love 'round here
I loved you once, but it made me dumb
Now I'm seeing it way too clear
You hurt me numb, and for that I've run out of time
To have pain to feel 
I've been your game
Just taking the blame for too long
Get on out of here
Don't look back, I won't come back

To beat them motherfuckers in they head to get them
Off of them, Haha


Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin' pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin' for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost

I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin' like a playa, stop chasin' the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin', no rushin', just takin' it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, baby girl

Away from people who never treat you like they should
Honey, go
Go

In the woods or in the ice and snow
Where there is no one else you know
You've really nowhere else to go

And every win is the beginning of defeat

Turn your demons into shadows
Into the shadows
We shall exhaust all that we fight
Fight your demons now
Leave them no other way than to hide
Hide your darkest side

When our destinies collide
Our intrinsic values cry out for action
Never stay aside
Only emptiness remains
If we can't get rid of our frustrations

Will change our world forever

Fight your demons inside
Leave them no other way than to hide

Stand tall and

I got one, you got one, and now we equal
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people
Sometimes it has connotations of evil
Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to
It's called the ego


Ay, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated
Some may hate it and some may overrate it
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend
So all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen
It's called the ego
Come up with an idea, and no one seems to get it
Then every time you mention it
They stare like you're two-headed
But one day, in your cubicle, your idea really comes to view
Your boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places
And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego
She knows you need the chicken
And you know that she's your people
They call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy
They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy
And now that inner voice, that ego, making you get wavy
Change your diet, hit the gym
And say, ""What were you saying to me?""
The ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music
Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest

Lyin' next to you in the dark
I can feel your beating heart
You've been here beside me through the test of time
We've both had our share of doubts
Waited out those old storm clouds
Boy, it's nights like this that I know why
Lovers like you and me will never say die


'Cause there's a long line of folks giving up on love
So many hearts get broken in the push and shove
I'll believe in you for the rest of my life
Baby, lovers like you and me will never say die


Tears of joy and tears of pain
Tears say more than words explain
There's no need for words here tonight
We've both felt each others power
A tender touch in the wee small hours
Is strong enough to hold us for a lifetime
Lovers like you and me will never say die


'Cause there's a long line of folks giving up on love

And you took away the sorrow
And you took away the gloom

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually


Yo, I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
And what's your name?
Consequence, I'm type burnt like flames
And why's that?
American dreams, they got the ghetto kid in a fiend
Don't stress that 'cause it's not in your bloodstream
Your whole being, comes from greatness, do remember
Shatan got you caught in the storms of December
And brothers on the block packing nines like September
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender
Yo, I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie, they was actin unruly
 Yo, word up, yo, I was type caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because the positive it sees that negative die
Yo, we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at my Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm, let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo, I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path 
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that




You got the N.W.O. 
Your baby's on the way 
And crosstown niggas trying to 
Aiiyo they got me stressed out 


Dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lo, dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lee
Me no look for trouble but trouble done follow me
All I wanted to be was a illa MC
Ever since me was small as a youth out in Queens
What did you mash on de dancehall 
Until my best friend caught two in him head 
And ever since that day  things been a mess
R.I.P Ghosta Rock, true ting, God bless
So nowadays I go see wifey just to cure me from stress
Lay my head on her breast
Sugar dumpling knows best
Explaining all my problems to her getting things off my chest
A little hook up, squeeze up, and no more am I vexxed
Aiiyo son, without my peeps I'd be truly assed out
Make sure I have my medication so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me, when everyone was fessing
Most of all Jah Mighty for the guidance and the blessings

"Of war and peace the truth just twists
It's curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

The lamppost stands with folded arms
It's iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle black Madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

The kingdoms of experience
In the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

Open their mouth, their grill gleamin' 
Candy paint, keep that whip clean and 
 They always be talkin' that country slang, we like
 The beat that be in the back beatin' 
Eyes be so low from the chief and 
I love how he kept my body screamin' 
A rude boy that's good to me, with street credibility


If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street, if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things, if you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street, if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough, and he better be street


 We like them boys up top from the BK 
Know how to flip that money three ways 
Always ridin' big on the freeway 
 With that east coast slang, that us country girls, we like
 Low cut caesars with the deep waves 
So quick to snatch up your Beyonce 
Always comin' down, poppin' our way 
 Tellin' us that country girls the kind of girls they like






You lookin' for a soldier, Bizarre's just that
Matter of fact
I just came back from Iraq
Wow
Crazy
Somethin' the girls like
And for a beat got, I got a whole lot of pipe 
And I don't want your number
Cause all that's fake
I'm a harass you, call you, til I get a date 
And feed you cake
Walks on the lake
I told you I was your fatso-mate/phat soulmate 
I can't buy you a car
Or diamond rings
But I can give you a Pepsi
Out a soda machine 
So you lookin' for a soldier
Girl, I'm ready
Beyonce, Michelle and
Kelly






I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight 
Just might give one the phone tonight 
Homey in the Dickies in my zone tonight 
He don't know it might be on tonight
Oh, he lookin' good and he talkin' right 
He the type that might change my life 
Everytime he look at me, my girls be like 
That one may be the one tonight

Ripped it down the middle

Threw my clothes out in the yard

In all black with the hard bottoms
Cop the daily news, skimming through the car columns
Making my way to the Pentecostal Church of Ebenezer with the grievers
They just killed Beaver for his sneakers
It's a fever on the ave, undercovers playing cabs
Raiding niggas labs, Lou Lav just got stabbed in his abs
It's sad, recession hitting niggas real hard
It forced a few jailbirds to go get jobs
Some'll starve, everything's a go in the hood
Sixteen little niggas sniffing blow in the hood
Set claiming, bandanas boosting their aiming
Shells ricocheting, shit ain't no use in complaining
Mama praying, the cancer done ate her calves
So the doc had to decapitate the leg in half
Do the math, it's over if I can't coach soon
Could have easily been the victim of a hot dope spoon, word to June


Get money, motherfucker get right
Get a blunt, get a bottle, get nice
Get a grip cause as soon as you slip, that's it

So my options don't vary, I'm holding like Dirty Harry
In a truck like I'm supposed to marry, so savvy
Sadly, I'm like a sick psychiatric
Finger on the ratchet, the feeling's so immaculate
No attachments, it's ice in my veins
To put it point blank, I ain't right in the brain
Politeness remains though I strike with the fangs
So strange, at night you can see them when they hang
What a shame, murder on the quietest block
The specialist, like somebody hired a cop
It's syphilis, I'm just trying to do what it do
Metaphoric for the pulpit, the eulogy's true
The toolery's glue, in and out the sooner we through
I been about cars, money, clout and jewelry too
Louis the who? 13th, with nothing to chase
So why ask? Here's the facts, I'm a basket case


Get money, motherfucker get right
Get a blunt, get a bottle, get nice
Get a grip cause as soon as you slip, that's it

Broke my mind always tryin' hard to fit in

They were always telling me that I was wrong
I was runnin' around I was chasing a dream

Oh Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works
Thy hands have made
I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed


Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art


When Christ shall come
With shouts of adulation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim My God
How great Thou art




How great Thou art

We spent our days in contemplation
Too much too soon
And though it hurts to let it linger on and on
You're all I need
What will my heart allow
When loneliness holds me down


So move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
But I guess you can't come out for a while


We spent our nights in conversation
Too much to prove
And I've been a fool to let it linger on and on
You're all I see
Shaping our love we found
Impossible higher ground


So move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
Well I guess you can't come out for a while


Won't you move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
Well I've come to learn how love can cage you
Tear you up then try to replace you
I guess I won't come out for a while
With no warning, no pause, no pity
Why-y -- why-why-y-y


Don't wake awake my soul anymore
Just stay away from me a little while
Where will you go when we walk away
Oooo-oooh -- ooo-ohh


My only comfort is gone
With no warning, no pause, no pity

Radiation burns my eyes
Love's forbidden so is passion
This whole place is sterilized

Day by day to just survive

Sleep don't visit, so I choke on sun
And the days blur into one
And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done
Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
Was never much but we made the most


Welcome home


Ships are launching from my chest
Some have names but most do not
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost
Peel the scars from off my back
I don't need them anymore
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars


I've come home

All my nightmares escaped my head
Bar the door, please don't let them in
You were never supposed to leave
Now my head's splitting at the seams
And I don't know if I can

Here, beneath my lungs, I feel your thumbs press into my skin again

Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk, and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I reserve love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What He showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, P.S., with love I shine

So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come, and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love-reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns, when desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we  I feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste
Embracin' you, life I let go
Gotta switch phones, cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you


Erotica, wet dreaming on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?

Slave to your loneliness 
Inside of loneliness 
With love of loneliness 
Enslaved by loneliness 


I want you to come, inside your mind
And find a place, nasty and kind
This is where, our desires grind
And where they peak, is most divine
A place and time, I hope we reach together
You are my queen, and freak forever
I feel you in-side my stomach
My body shakes

"Shrill as a choir of children
Urgent like the first day of May
False and inflatable feeling
Tugs at my senses, big as the Macy's Parade
One brick on top of another
Such is the measure of man
Planets are inset like diamonds
On a gravity halo, eternity's wedding band
I slept with that dealer all summer
The ecstasy is still in my spine
Coat check I couldn't remember
Walked into the winter, came out on the other side

And in the South the sun is shining
Back in the East the lights went out

Stuck on a ladder to heaven
On trial way back in the Hague
Lullaby sounds from the engine
In my Styrofoam coffin, asleep on the interstate
Black globes, old symbols of freedom
A murderer still on the lam
Cities encircled in iron
On a great silver beltway, democracy's shackled hands
Séance that brought us together
Objects we move with our minds
Coat check and I lost the number
Short sleeves in the winter, fell back through the other side

Out in the West the cars are crashing
Up in the North the ice gave out

"Roll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel?
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again

Do you feel lucky or do you feel scared?
Take what luck brings and the Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
And what will the next day bring?

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter?
So why don't you answer?
So why did you send an Angel to mend?

Best make decisions, before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reigns
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose, but so much to gain
A little danger, it goes without saying
But what do you care?
You're gonna go in the end

Gate open to Heaven is ready and waiting
Or straight down to Hell, can go there as well
I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
So why don't you go?
Just leave well alone


Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?


 



There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again

You have been warned but
Still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn

The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take?
Decisions to make
Arrive on the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait?
It may be too late



Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Gabriel the oldest son
He praised the Lord and married young
Became a priest and at confession
Cured the people of transgression
Gabriel he held the weight
Of everybody's toxic waste
And with a load upon his shoulder
Couldn't sleep as he got older


Oh oh oh
What it means to be someone
That everybody has to talk to
Everybody has to talk to
Oh oh oh
Our Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to
Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to


Looking for a place to be
Or some place he could hide his grief
Gabriel ran to the beach
And set out for the open sea
Heathed the baggage from the sand
Abort the vessel with his hands
And when he couldn't see the land
Released their sins on his command


Oh oh oh
What it means to be someone
That everybody has to talk to
Everybody has to talk to
Oh oh oh
Our Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to

That he could talk to


As the problems slowly drifted
All the weight was quickly lifted
From his bag into the sea
He finally felt he was free
When he got home after months
Sat down and waited for lunch
He looked down at an empty dish
Cause all their sins had killed the fish


Oh oh oh

That everybody has to talk to

Given you meaning but taken my place
So make your way on down to the sea
Something has taken you so far from me

Does it now seem worth all the colour of skies
To see the earth through painted eyes
To look through panes of shaded glass
See the stains of winter's grass

Can you now return to from where you came
Try to burn your changing name
Or with silver spoons and coloured light
Will you worship moons in winter's night

You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven
I like to kiss ya where some brothers won't
I like to tell ya things some brothers don't
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies

Bonita, Bonita, Bonita, Bonita, Bonita, come on!


Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail 'do
I used to be all on it like a fly to shit
Back in the days, Bonita was a hit
I flirted and I flirted 'til there was no end
But you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
Honey, you was funny but I'm tired of that
It's three years later, I got a new rap
You got a little older, a titbit wiser
I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
Speaking of high I saw you smoke a hootie mack
Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back
But I'm here to testify it'll be a hard try
Slapping my knees, letting out sighs
Want to keep it slamming like a hip-hop song
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on


Bonita Applebum 
Bonita Applebum 
Bonita Applebum 
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
I said Bonita Applebum 
Bonita Applebum

Bonita...

In the words of the immortal Sweet Daddy 


I'll never shed a tear but then again I won't steer
You wrong, I steer you strong, for affection steer here
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the Uno
What do you know, if we go to El Segundo
Your presence should be closer like on ""Buddy"" I'll toast
To the ever clever youth, to say the least, you're the most
Honey, you're my honey, a-yo, dip, you're my dip
Treasure and forever there'll be pleasure with Tip
As we glide and move
Cushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth
Ricky D said we got to ""show and prove""
Do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove
Intimidate the boy
Cupid that's his name
Picking all us suckers is his flipping game
But Tip don't fall for that
Instead I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest
Lambskin store, get a six-pack of hats for

Shooting for the stars
Desperately reaching
For something in the dark
Pictures of memories
Buried in my heart
Lie awake and dream of
The endless possibilities
Catch my breath and go for it


Take apart everything that's holding me down
Make a point to pick a new direction
To make a new connection


Is this what it feels like?
Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything
Feels like breaking out
When I can give up my reputation
Finally, I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts to say anything


Bold enough to fall
Flat on my face
But I walk as they crawl
Slowing down
It's such a waste of
Time to let go
Tapping my fingers
To the rhythm of a metronome
Counting opportunities


Take apart the gravity that's holding me down
Make a point to find a resolution
To be my own solution


Is this what it feels like?
Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything
Feels like breaking out
When I can give up my reputation
Finally, I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts to say anything


Go down, let me go
Let me go down alone
Let me go down
Just let me go down
If I'm gonna go down
Then just let me go
Let me go down
Let me go down
Just let me go
Let me go!


It feels like
Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything
Feels like breaking out
When I can give up my reputation
Finally, I can see

Finally, I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts to say anything

You tell me get away
But you don’t mean that
You tell me leave you alone
But you don’t need that
On my own too
“Honey I don’t need you
Look at how I’ve grown
I'm a big girl
I can do it by myself
All on my own”


So why you wanna love me so bad?
Why you wanna love me so bad?
Haven’t you heard about my miserable past
Critical past, pitiful past?
I swear no matter what I touch it breaks
So I no longer wanna see your face 


I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
Or maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
I swear I got the worst luck with love
The worst luck with love
Maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
No no, no no
Oh, no


Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why

I tell you let it go but you don’t want to
I ask you what the fuck you want
Just say I want you
Are you crazy
You could have it all
Why settle for me?
You're doing good
You should keep going
Don’t backpedal for me


So why you wanna love me so bad?
Why you wanna love me so bad?
Haven’t you heard about my miserable past
Critical past, pitiful past?
I swear no matter what I touch it breaks
So I no longer wanna see your face 


I got the worst luck with love

But maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
I swear I got the worst luck with love

But maybe I ain't working enough
Ain't hurting enough

Morning always seems too stale to justify
Lament blossoms, hours minutes of our lives
Broken thoughts run through your empty mind
At least a beaten dog knows how to lie


I feel like I'm missing pieces of sleep
A memory fades to a, a pale landscape
You were an extinction, a desert heat
A blind illness of my anxiety


Endless hours in bed, no peace, in this mind
No one knows the hell where innocence dies
Fragments crawling like cobwebs on stone
Blows away the safety only a sleeping pill knows


I feel like I'm missing pieces of sleep
A memory fades to a, a pale landscape
You were an extinction, a desert heat
A blind illness of my anxiety

I feel like I'm missing pieces of sleep
A memory fades to a, a pale landscape
You were an extinction, a desert heat

Saying thank you and I love you

This heart of mine is made of silver
This heart of mine is made of gold
It will shine like a candle
When your world is dark and cold


This heart of mine is made of timber
This heart of mine is made of stone
When you're walking all alone
Like a bridge across the mountain
When you're walking all alone
This heart of mine is made of iron
This heart of mine is made of steel
It won't turn toward another
When the wind is on the heal
When the wind is on the heal
When your world is dark and cold

This heart of mine is made of gold
It will shine like a candle

She walks through the city
No one recognizes her face
They don't want her pity
No one ever mentions her name
She's carried the broken
But their scars have no name in her heart
'Cause she walks in forgiveness
She'll shine like a light in the dark


She is love
She is love
She is love
She is love


She'll always remember
The days when they welcomed her here
They know if they need her
She made a promise to always be here


She is love
She is love

When they are weak she will always be strong
Though they don't know it they're never alone
No matter how many times they may leave
It's never hopeless cause she still believes

On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn Yayo into dough
The original don dada, nobody bomb harder
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats they say ""He so crazy""
The snitches they say ""He tried to spray me""
But that's what you get for trying to play me
The aftermath and my wrath is so shady
No matter how you try, you can't stop this
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coupé cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
""50, you need some help?"" Chill, Yayo, I got this
See, where I'm from, man, the D's tryin' to knock us
They swear to God that it's me selling the choppers
Man, I ain't give them little niggas no product

I'm a bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard


From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics 'cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood, they be trying to G us
Trying to holla at the kid every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thugging
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm bugging
We family, baby, kissing cousins
Now look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven
I'm a New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'til the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, ok, go to ya husband

The drama will have ya ass in trauma, boy

"Thank you so much. Hi, baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredible

And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?


I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know


And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward


I bet they wonder how I go on, go on


I'll simply say ""it's on again, it's on again,"" whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh


I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people


And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken



I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say ""it's on again, it's on again,"" whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh


Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto


I bet they wonder how I go on, go on

He was the son of the chief of police

And old Joe
Did and said as he would
Took all the shopping carts from the mall
And took 'em to Utah
Which was Zion
He built an empire out of the desert
Out of the dust and the sand, just like Las Vegas
But he never took the rap that the Mafia did

And he thought the Indians were some lost thirteen dudes
But he didn't treat 'em any better
And they were never on his side
They drove their pickup trucks out into the desert
Into a ditch along the side of the road
And acted like they were drunk
All the time

And old Joe had thirteen beady-eyed babies
One of whom I used to go to school with
He'd drive his car at a hundred ten down the alley way
Throwing cinder blocks at trash cans
And I declare on this occasion
I've never seen this heaven or this place any differently
But now and then I dream of the flying saucers
And they're coming to take us away

Girl I know you're fed up but things gonna get a lot better

Don't wanna see you give up, whatever you do, don't let up

Girl I know that things are hard now
And you're feeling that you're all alone
Mom & dad's no long 'round now
Cause now you're grown with kids of your own
Baby dad is nowhere to be found
While you play the role of mom & papi

Always home and can't go out now
Can't remember the last time that you were happy
Whatever you do..


Girl I know you're fed up but things gonna get a lot better

Don't wanna see you give up, whatever you do, don't let up

Every man that you meet on the streets
You're looking at him like he's an enemy

Girl I know that you can't hurt no more
You've been damaged, can't trust nobody
And I know that you can just move on
If you let your past go with the wind

Then you will find that guy that you always wanted
From friend to husband
So girl just know that..


Girl I know you're fed up but things gonna get a lot better

Don't wanna see you give up, whatever you do, don't let up

No matter how bad things get
Girl don't let it get to you
I know you're trying to make ends meet
So girl don't let it get to you
You only got one life to live
So don't let it get to you
So go on and make the best of it
Just don't let it get to you

Don't wanna see you give up, whatever you do, don't let up

Bitch, pick up ash off the blunt when it spill
I ain't paying for shit, I got three hunnid pills
Palm full of pills, I might die any day, hope I die with no will
There's a way to escape, it's called digging your grave
I don't chill with nobody, or meet face-to-face
I'm just waitin' in here until I can creep outta my cave
Don't try and save what cannot be saved
I cannot be saved, 'cause I am a slave to my own mistakes
I hope I fade away like a memory fades in my brain
Pray that I slay all the prey, blade that drains my fucking veins
Satan, please save me today
I break away, now I've escaped

Gettin' bombed out on booze
Got nothing to lose
Run out of money
Disposable blues
Sleazy hotels
Like living in hell
The girl's on the hustle
With nothing to sell


Want something for nothing
It's always the same
Keep pushin' and shovin'
And I'm down on the game
Always in trouble
Forever detained


Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck


Well, spread out the news
There's a free man loose
Back out of jail
And chasing some flooze
Bad luck has changed
Broken the chains
Laid out a claim
For monetary gains


Wantin' what's coming
All for the take
Freedom for lovin'
And lust for a taste
Eyes are wide open
Wild to the game

Bye, bye, bye, bad luck
Throw down the gates of bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance

And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark
And I feel its warmth
In my hands, in my heart
But why can't I hold on?

Into the flood, into the flood


And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers

It comes and goes in waves

Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space

We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

And carries us away

Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find


It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does


And the freedom of falling

It slips through my fingers

Come back down the best that we know how
We know now


We're all tryin' to quit smokin'
Tired of laughin', tired of jokin'
'Bout the habits we all have slowly creepin' up
We all gotta die from somethin'
Livin' kills you, life is tough
But I can't quit 'cause I can't quit enough


I've felt all the pressures playin' to an empty room
And the pleasures of a crowd that's singin' loud to every word to all my songs
But the band and me, Lord, keep rollin' on
We roll on


We're still tryin' to quit smokin'
Tired of laughin', tired of jokin'
'Bout the habits we all have slowly creepin' up
We all gotta die from somethin'
Livin' kills you, life is tough
I can't quit 'cause I can't quit enough




We're all tryin' to quit smokin'

I'll never quit 'cause I can't quit enough

You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, you won't ever bring me down!


I'm good, I'm fine, this life's divine
No hate, no shame, no one to blame
You might disguise, your life with lies
I won't chastise even if you think you can...


Bring me down!
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, You won’t ever bring me down!


I can't escape from your disdain
Your hurt, your pain, your drama is lame
Why can't you find some peace inside?
I won't chastise even when you think you can...


Bring me down!
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, You won’t ever bring me down!

"There's a picture frame hangin' at the end of the hall
Pile of dust on the floor where my fist met the drywall
That's my MO, leavin' something broke everywhere I go
Holes

There's a rusty old truck door sittin' in a field
That I filled full of buckshot every time i got
Mad at something over nothing didn't matter at all
Holes

In my life, down in my bones
From my heart, to my soul

There's a lonely space on the big brass bed where we first made love
And she laid head on my shoulder before I told it was over
Holes

There's a million conversations with my old man
'Bout who he was, and who I am
That I never had, I just wouldn't listen
I just kept digging myself down in 'em holes in my life

Down in my bones
From my heart, to my soul
Holes

Well I woke up today, put the shovel down
Stepped out of my haze, took a look around
Saw a ray of light shining through the clouds
So I climbed out
And I let it shine

Down in my bones
From my heart, right through my soul
Through all my holes
Through all these holes

"If you give a cowboy a horse and a stretch of fence
You can bet the farm he'll ride all day til the whole damn thing is fixed
He'll come dragging back around along about supper time

If you give a cowboy a truck on a friday night
He'll bore a hundred dollar bill from the coffee can
Spray the mud off of them tires, drop twenty dollars in the tank, save the rest for beer

So all you girls in here need to know this

If you give a cowboy a kiss he'll want more
He's gonna want to give you a twist out on that hardwood floor
If you let him, girl if you let him
He's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is, if you give a cowboy a kiss

If you tell a cowboy he can't he'll prove he can
Cause there really ain't nothing much that he can't do with his two hands
He can fight his way out of corners, or he can softly lay you down
There ain't no time like now to find out

If you give a cowboy a kiss he'll want more
He's gonna want to give you a twist out on that hardwood floor
If you let him, girl if you let him
He's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is
If you give a cowboy a kiss

Hear the ocean wind, it'll take the shore
If you take a chance on love tonight here's what's in store
If you give a cowboy a kiss
If you give a cowboy a kiss he's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is

If you give a cowboy a kiss

"Well, I recall his parting words
Must I accept his fate?
Or take myself far from this place
I thought I heard a black bell toll
A little bird did sing
Man has no choice when he wants everything

We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride

Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught up in the mechanism
Of swindlers who act like kings
And brokers who break everything
The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
Why would I want him just to lose him again?

We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride

We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride

Just live and let die
Check, check, check, come on


If you could take a minute of your life
That certain minute when you feel the lightning strike
To each his own on the level of that moment
But it's your moment, and you know you'll fucking own it
Glorified and embraced by your victory
When you're done, you escape with that memory
Blindfolded through this life as we learn
And consequences when the wrong page is turned


It's an E! True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next


At some point, we come down from the highs
And so be it, we move on with our lives
Some of us let the laughs cover cries
Do the math, you can laugh when I die
If life is just a fantasy, then could you
Live this fantasy life? If so, then would you?
Just remember that the doors are not closeable
And your motherfucking heroes are disposable


It's an E! True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next

Or the white kids who ain't white anymore?
Or the actors that don't act anymore?
Or the rappers that don't rap anymore?

Just live and let die
Just live and let die, just live and let, just live and let
Just live and let die


But no, it's impossible
Just to live your, live your life and let us die

Welcome to the 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards Cypher
I go by the name of 6LACK and I came with  Little Simz, Mysonne, Axel Leone and the homie Tee Grizzley
Yo, DJ Premier, let's get it


Hey, posed at the north side of that London
Where fed there's always a pagan teeth
Look quiet, don't trust 'em
Where if you walk around with a chip on your shoulders
Tryna get lemon, couldn't get battered
You know it, where I come from
73 will get me from home to college and back
Winter will make me go from my home to college and back
Why? Ain't tryna be out in the cold like that
Boujee still, when this city grow like that?
Cute in hills, then a trackie for the road like that
All details, yeah, I can do both like that
I push my own set of wheels on the road like that
Shit, I'm actually a G, my friends, you know like that
Trust me, I'ma free up, I'm been moving and weaving
Now the gate in my ways, through the system, I seen museum
Everyone's got a purpose, everybody's a being
Being the only alien, y'all around me, I'm seeing
More than you can imagine, who'd of thought this would happen?
Teachers looked at me funny when I said I'd make it from rapping
Still got love for Miss Rosen, still got love for Miss Wilton
I don't fuck with Miss Chambers, she didn't do me no favours
Calling out all the agents, can't see beyond they nose
I kill shit then I kill shit, when shit's killed, I'm ghost
Don't wanna talk depressed, get them cameras out my face
I'm anti-social as fuck, lord, just need a smaller space, space


Yo, I wanted them to say something for having but I'm pissed off
That I ain't take it serious then, and it took me this long
I pissed on everything I ain't doing number two long
What is you on? I'm heroine, I traveled here in a brick form
They turned on me, all ego, man
I had to start again from scratch like Preemo hands
Did more, Halle Berry in a Coogi, I'm a big storm
I rip y'all, you wack, off rip but it rip off
I almost quit sniff, quarter drip then I gripped on
We lit mom, I'm at the awards without a hit song
Think I said ""kill it on BET""
Like don't be human, be an alien, be E.T
EBT? That's a TBT
Turn BET to Boriqua y TTV, juice
Leon, rappers don't got enough fire to show me
Young Jugo, y'all could call me five fire emojis
Put rappers in a pot, come and check if it's boiling
You put him feet first and push him 'til his neck in and boil it
Thirst 'til everything in your saving and checking is voided
Couldn't stone but he collect unemployment
Heard him almost threw up, sewer, doo doo like he grew up next to the toilet
I don't even put in effort, I spoil it
For everybody trying Leon on line they can't effin' avoid it
I ain't stop, already effin' destroyed it
We run rap from the jump, I'm KRS One to Capital Pun
That's when I promised Pun I would bring rap back to the Bronx
We catch him, let him go, put him back in the trunk
After the pump blast to the lung, they task in the trunk, mhm
Wrist said I'm big with it like a half a key
My neck chilly like I've never been to Applebee's
I'm the best, no offense to anyone that back with me
Bruh, they set you up before they put you after me, Jugo


Welcome to reality
I'm a fake rapper's rivalry, the leader of the cavalry
Young Huey P. with Big Meech mentality
The rap Kapernick with 2Pac's anatomy
I got 'em mad at me
'Cause I freed kids from the trap and put morals over salary
But they would rather me lie the way they lied to me
Have them in these streets dying, becoming casualties
But nah, I'm a whole different breed
Everybody following, I was sent to lead
I'm a soldier, when I bleed, I just lick the wound
No, you not a G, you got it misconstrued
You all on IG, lying to get views
You got these little kids dying, trying to listen to you
Or they sitting in prison instead of sitting in school
Because you told them play the game, didn't give them the rules
Won't you tell them to fix their plan just to lose
To all my young kings: don't ever listen to fools
Nah, I'm not hatin', just a little confused
How show 'em all the diamonds, never give 'em no jewels?
And if you're tired of the buffoonery
Follow me, I'll show you how to shine without jewelry
Show you how to grind and bought back to community
Bring black on black crime, back to black unity
If you a G, I know you see you and me
Gangster, but wow, ain't nothin' nigga can do with me
One man army, imagine if it was two of me
I swear next year Oprah gon' try to cougar me, huh
'Cause I did it on my own
I'm putting work, now I'm sitting on his throne
Crown me the same way that you do any king
I rather nail for something than just stand for anything


At the cypher, I ain't write this, let it come from head
One rule amongst my gang, let's keep one in the head
They hatin' but they ain't gonna touch one of my dreads
After I gun at your head, boy I'm 'gon come for your mans
I'm from Detroit, where we run up through bandz
Cut up them grams and go dumb with them scams
You owe me some money, better run my bread
When mark jump out with that pump, you can't run it's sprayin'
They throw their beef over the gram, they feds
Can't even speak about my beef, they dead
Only time rappers start to act like my friend
Is when they in my city looking for protection, they scared
I can't eat without my dawgs, they fed
I can't really tell if they opps or they fans
I think that prison did somethin' to my head
I was locked up with somethin' this long strapped to my leg
I heard the trenches got a hero, it's about time
Hundred on my neck, I came a long way from Compton
Fifty on my wrist, I came a long way from child time
If I stacked up hundreds, it would stand about 5'9""
Ballin' on these boys like I'm Bron-Bron
Dunked that green side and that white side, Hassan
Everywhere I go I'm strapped down like I rock climb
I would keep goin' but I ain't got time, hah


Around the time when Lil Wayne was on every hook
I was on my worm-tip, I was in every book
And T-Pain was killin' every remix he could smell
Them my homie did some shit and had to sit in the cell
So I focused on my music, chose my sentences well
Now my sentences sell, I don't censor them well
Connected to a higher power like I sit in a cell
Tower, this ain't rappin' while I'm splitting a cell
Okay, all my favourite rappers are washed up
And write the same song ten times, leave me star-struck
My president on crack, my exes is black like my name is
I ain't even 'posed to be famous
I heard 'em saying ""Who they sayin', who be they?""
But they ain't never put the work in
Internet surfing, Instagram lurking, been waitin' on this moment since Tigger was in the basement
106 was poppin', Free looked amazing
Damn, that boy got a flow of a hunnid guns
She say ""Baby, you a savage,"" I say ""21, 21""
When I finish this verse, download my album
Take a chance on a rapper, you don't want no problems
Watched enough cyphers to know I need a gun bar
Somethin' 'bout an AR and how that thing is dumb tall
I'ma take it, I'ma swing it like a pendulum, dog
And your toupée ain't safe, so you better run, dog
It's a DMX flow, it's a we up next flow
They can't really handle bars, it's a BMX flow
I'm skippin' through this thing like I'm Snoop, what it do?
Atlanta got a star, boy, I'm the proof
Hip-hopped over the beat, hopscotched over the street
Top-notch, mispronounce my name and get pop-rocked
I come from the east, we hustle for a ten piece and split it with the game
It's FREE 6LACK and I'll be here until you know the name

Drown me in my daily cup of tea
Tell the porcupines to quit stabbing me
They make me fall but I will stand
Cus all of them are jerks with their cups in their hands

Now they want a whisper, a whisper from me
Cus all of them have watched me on their big screen TVs
But what about little ol', little ol' me?
The one who got bullied because of her teeth


I hope you all are watching my middle finger rise
To the bullies in the school yard, I know im on your mind
Now you say you love me, but what about before?
When I was just that silly little girl next door


Ladies, oh, ladies, why are you so mad?
Is it cus I'm classy and you're a trash bag?
You teasing and laughing resonates through my heart
And now you're calling me 'cus you want a fresh start

Now look at me boys, you can't believe your eyes
You told me I was ugly and I took you by surprise
You should've been nicer, cus look where im at
While you copy Mac Miller wearing snap back hats


I hope you all are watching my middle finger rise
To the bullies in the school yard, I know im on your mind
Now you say you love me, but what about before?

I hear people talking bad
About the way we have to live here in this country
Harping on the wars we fight
And griping 'bout the way things oughta be
And I don't mind 'em switching sides
And standing up for things they believe in
When they're running down my country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me


Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me
Running down the way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song I'm singing be a warning
If you're running down my country, man

I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims, he just don't believe in fighting
An' I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of living
When they're running down my country, hoss

I woke up to another mess in the living room
Broken bottles all around my feet
They came again in the night under crescent moon
Didn't wake me in my sleep


'Cause they talk and drink and laugh 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
I hide and cower in the corner
Conversation's getting hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody seems to care 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
In the background screaming, ""Everybody, look at me""


And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
I'm standing in the ashes of who I used to be
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire, fire


I used to be a darling starlet like a centerpiece
Had the whole world wrapped around my ring
I flew too closely to the sun that's setting in the East
And now I'm melting from my wings


'Cause I'd laugh and drink and talk 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
Now it´s my own anxiety
That makes the conversation hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody ever cares 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd

I'm so motherfucking picky

Her Daddy gave her, her first pony
Then taught her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell I don't know how many times
He taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well

Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry


She grew up
She got married
Never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started coming home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart

Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then

Phone rang early one morning
Her momma's voice, she'd been crying
Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said

Too soon God will let you know why

Good morning america
A new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us

You can't see me, invisible ski mask
Poke the eye's out my beanie
Ghetto zorro on the headlines, i leave
Feces shit on niggas, nigga
My flow come in plural
Multiple of it, majority love it
I got the masses, meaning societies public
Low dickey shorts, LA fashion still holding grudges
Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac niggas
Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead
Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
Instead, we dusted off pulled the bullet out our heads
Left a permanent scar, for the whole world to recognize

"Now that I know
The way it goes
You gotta pay back every penny that you owe

Twelve years old
In your mama's clothes
Shut the blinds and lock up every door

And if you hear
Someone's comin near
Just close your eyes and make them disappear now

Years away
Finds me here today
On my own, always on my way now

So I send my friends
Gifts from where I've been
Something for the hand they're never there to lend

Better keep those eyes
Climbing paradise
And don't pretend you won't reach it in the end now

Dearest dear
I know you been here
Why'd you run tell me why'd you disappear now

That you're not
Here with me
Seems to be the only time that I can see you clearly

I may not know
How to treat or give you what you need
But I am a gentleman who says what he means now

And now I sing
Upon my knees
And praise the kindness of a gentle breeze

I see it swell
Like a story in me to tell
Told years away and past my baby dying

So you raise them up
To heaven always hell
They're unaware, share, give a hand to help son

Oh you give them away
But they'll come back to you someday
Wanna know why nobody was ever there to help them

And no it ain't fair
And if God forbid you care
It's enough to get you in a whole lotta trouble

Oh realize
It ain't wise to idealize
Or put your life in the hands of any struggle

Never renounce
Or ever claim to be
And never buy that freedom just ain't free now

Sifting in the sand
Like a hymn within to help us understand

Heaven awaits
We're making our last stand
Glory bound and sparrow in our hand

A wood floor and new socks on your bare feet

A steep hill underneath a foot of snow
A greased pig fallen off a pickup truck

I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside picking blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road


Her daddy didn't like me much
In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road


It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned
I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road


It's where I drank my first beer

And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

Now, having said that, I'll go back to this document. This was a meeting, okay this was what he said:
“Very soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will effect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register, or suffer being unable to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions.

Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges. They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability. After all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges. This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call 'Social Insurance.' Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner, every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly. The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption, and we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against America.”

Lookin' like ace, talkin' 'bout spade, you are afraid though
Spendin' my queso
All on some fake clothes
When I change, never say, this is my blaze throat
South Central
All my homies know
If I could go, I would just wait though


Anyways, gotta go, disregard what I say
Grain of salt, sprinkle some over the shoulder, ayy
Lucky Strike, filterless, don't push me, 'kay?
Sensitive, abrasive, stab you in the face
Keep a blade, heaven sakes, had to raise the stakes
Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
Now where did I go? Where do we go?
How do we grow? How should I know?
Feel responsible, intolerable, displaced , insane


Piss 'em off, piss 'em off, piss 'em off
Shit, I better set it off
I just made a deposit, CDG in my closets
Fuel ain't really made of fossils
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Spying on your ho from a SpaceX rocket
She wanna know why my wrist so rocky
Flash splash on me, photocopy

Shoot me a sheriff for Trayvon Martin
King, Ali, and Bobby Marley

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man

Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious


Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin


Gun shots every night in the 
Crooked cops on sight in the 
Every day is a fight in the 
 
Got kids to feed in the 
Selling coke and weed in the 
Every day somebody bleed in the 
 


I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead


Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

Living in the  oh
Eating in the  or

Thats the life when ur

And unemployment is making people turn to crime

About the blackman's struggle in a Africa

If I had to fight for emancipation
Then I shall resist for my liberation
And with truth and right I shall win my liberty
We shall unite to secure the victory

Need to listen to the children and the weapons they concealing
Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million

Things have been getting pretty rough around here
No coffee cups flying 'round the room
Just daggers born from tears
Let’s try to crawl out from under our breath
We can never break up, so I love you to death
The man I'd become was so comfortably dumb
I believe you could mean it, but you’re not having fun
And I’m sorry


I learned to breathe I guess some time ago
But just recently I learned what it means to take it slow
I’m lousy with excuses and you know I love to swear
So goddamnit, I swear to whatever’s out there
And I love you more now than I ever have, so


Let’s pick another day to call it quits and walk away
Let’s find some other time to break down
The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the darkness, and I will too
You might leave me still, but not today
For now, can we just stay?
Can we just stay?


You would think by now that I’d be fine
Y'know, like really stretching out
But it would all be lies
I'm no longer in control of my own shoes
There they go
Quickly running out of booze
Drinking to kill myself to live without you
Over there, where I’m still scared
Sometimes


Let’s pick another day to call it quits and walk away
Let’s find some other time to break down
The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the darkness, and I will too
You might leave me still, but not today
For now, can we just stay?
Can we just stay?
For now, can we just stay?
Can we just stay?
For now, can we just stay?

"You know patience pushing a dream
Brings my demons to life
Songs are vacations, our soul salvation
Will you suspend your disbelief, I’d like to be the thief
That steals that jaded necklace
That you’re always wearing, yo
I’d take that thing and with my knife I’d start paring so
Chop, chop, piece, piece and send it to the raiders of LA
There are so many, this land of plenty
The things we lack straight square within our grasp

Ever you do, ever you think
Whether you’re brown or you’re pink
I think not thinking’s better ’bout it when you stop to think
The jaded ones will wither while the optimistic grow
I settle that a bet’ll let a large amount so

Indulge me just for a minute, imagine no one holdin’ out
All trying for peace, my brothers down, some others down
It happens slow, think you should know
The direction that the world go, peace

The number six to make them feel like men
They one up us cuz we’re much too much for them, ok
The method to the mischief’s over there then
Psych, shazam, we strike with the lightnin’
Through space we move and emit an ill tracer
We’re set to light your world, kid, we’re your maker
Check it, our karma, plus the avant garder
Style of our sect, wise to ways comes to wreck

Whether you’re brown or you’re pink
I think not thinking’s better ’bout it when you stop to think
The jaded ones will wither while the optomistic grow
I settle that a bet will get our sweet-ass style down

While the masses mill around curse in anguish
311 stompin’ ‘em down with the quickness
We see all the crews that be comin’ around now
Makin’ they notes to get our sweet-ass style down

Fending off the foes that try to shut us down
Like the warrior souls we are we never give in
What we call is dope, we know will come around
Chill in southern Cali, y’all, that’s how we livin’

We spend our lives learning
If you like learning, life is large
It could never be only the ups
And the downs will always come around, yeah yeah

But when the clouds come, make animals

Sometimes I let it take me like a greased and vertical sled
I know the trick won’t break me, it’s all dancing in my head
People think that they can change most people it ain’t true
It’s easy to talk about change, ain’t easy followin’ through
Once it starts, it has to finish, once it rolls, it’s gonna crash
You know it finds its limit, today’s heroes tomorrow’s trash


He never blinks, he never blinks, he doesn’t care what you think
Cause there’s an eye in my hurricane
There’s an eye in my hurricane
There’s something calm watching in the center of me
Cause there’s an eye to my hurricane


People fly around me like dead leaves in high wind
They stream down the chokin' streets and never quite reach the end


Sometimes I wear a blue buzzsaw, I wear it like mohawk steel
Sometimes I ride my fatal flaw blindfolded, do it by feel


He never blinks, he never blinks, he doesn’t care what you think

See a summer without trips 
Mad hoops so the little boys might bark at you

Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come


There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt


Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me


There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt


I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down


The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood

Look at us waking up in last night's clothes
Smelling like last night's smoke
Laughing at last night's jokes
Man, last night was dope
Went from flirting right back to burning
It feels real good learning


Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like
 baby in the pouring rain
 middle of a hurricane
Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night
Nothing lights like an old flame




The off is all the way back to ten
We ain't gotta tell our friends
Thanks to that salty rim
Back in that groove again
Shouldn't be surprising
They could see the smoke signals rising


Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like
 baby in the pouring rain
 middle of a hurricane
Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night
Nothing lights like an old flame




Yeah, it all started with tequila on your lips
Yeah, it ends up with you and me like this


Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like

Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night

This is not rehearsal

Lost my contemplation
Should I answer it?
Certain confrontation
What do you knows
It comes to blows
My ears are ringing from your vibrations
So what do you call a girl who trips like that?
You call her history
Huh huh huh history
Leaving no mystery
Had to leave

When you called my house
You must have slipped a card
Everything changed, man
Wagging like a dog
A tale of two reggae MC’s
Switching up styles
Saying what they please, uh

Keep it going now

Stopped by deception
And I learned my lesson
I’ll never ever do it again, no
Stopped by deception
And I learned my lesson
I’ll never ever do it again, no

I got the shock of my life
Movin too fast
Just run, run, run
Playing out my very last chance to run

Taking me down off this cross
Lay me down in the dust
Where my eyes can't't see
No more sober words of love

This is my last chance to run
I crossed the line
And you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
To live, to be alive
Just run, run, run

Take a look in the mirror

Movin too fast

All I need to know

Said we'd draw straws when it came time

Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head

Remember Actavis came with a double seal
And I had just poured me a 12 of Wock
You can keep the Qualitest all to yourself
Cause nigga I'm a real drank head, real drank head
You ain't sipping drank, that shit head
Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch
I should've known she ain't sip drink when she said Qualitest was better than Actavis
I called cuban for 12 pints of Wock, any other nigga better know that he's taxing shit


It's payday every day
You ain't tryna fuck, bitch, skate
Can't come through, ball and no chain
Adios, knock 'em back to 5th grade
And what I'm sippin' on a milkshake

All hundreds on me, but I'm on a rampage

You be sipping yellow, you be sipping green
That shit deadly, you need to stick to weed

They gon' be down for the week up

Told the bitch put on a seatbelt

Didn't know about bank accounts, I went and made one
You got red in here, get away from my dope
This bitch too damn playful, spilled drank on my clothes
Love no thotties, I don't
Hopped out of a Rhino
Your life fugazi, you need to undo
Backspace, typeover
Drank made me go, ""I need you"" 
If it ain't purple then I can't see you 
Bitch just text me saying ""I'm gon' freak you when I see you""
I'm a well known nigga, you a Dr. Doolittle

Call a camera man, it's a photoshoot

Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year


But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely


I still have dreams, they’re not the same
They don’t fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said, “You don’t remember me do you?”


But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely


Still got time, still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
Got a mom, got a dad
But they do not have each other


So line on up and take your place
Show your face to the morning
Because one of these days you’ll be
Born and raised and it
All comes up without warning

I made you open up your eyes
Didn't I?

I helped you open out your wings
Your legs, and many other things
Didn't I?

Am I the greatest bastard that you know?
The only one who let you go?
The one you hurt so much you cannot bear?

Well we were good, when we were good
When we were not misunderstood

You helped me love, you helped me live
You helped me learn how to forgive
Didn't you?

I wish that I could say the same
But when you left, you left the blame
Didn't you?

Am I the greatest bastard that you met?
The only one you can't forget?
Am I the one your truth's been waiting for?

Or am I just dreaming once again?
Some dreams are better when they end

Some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down

We learn to wag and tuck our tails
We learn to win and then to fail
Didn't we?

We learn that lovers love to sing
And that losers love to cling
Didn't we?

Am I the greatest bastard that you know?
When will we learn to let this go?
We fought so much, we've broken all the charm

But letting go is not the same
As pushing someone else away

So please don't let on
You don't know me
Please don't let on
I'm not here
Please don't let on
You don't love me
Cause I know you do
I know

Some force and some will fake it

Some ruin and some regret it

But I've walked a crooked path
And I've felt worthy of forgiveness
And deserving heaven's wrath
Right on the money and off by a mile
Ahead of my time and way out of style


But I'm hanging tough, I haven't had enough
I am not giving up on life or love


Well, I try to stay away from the bottle
But I've reached out for the glass
I try to pull back on the throttle
But I still run out of gas
I've been an angel, but never a saint
Hung with the devil, don't nobody faint

A symbol of liberty, you set the captives free

Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered
“Just because”

Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue


Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?


There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof

The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs

The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim
“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”
But Joey stepped up, and he raised his hands, said, “We’re not those kind of men
It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”




The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met
“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”

He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men because they seemed to understand
What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand

When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”




It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Emptied out the register, said, “Tell them it was Crazy Joe”

One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy




Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He is not dead, he’s just asleep”
Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save

The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if God’s in heaven overlooking His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve

 I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
 And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
 But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
 Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own


I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong


And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
 Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
 What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
 Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own


I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong


I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today


I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong


I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong

They took away his brain
They tattooed ""defect"" on his brow
And signed him up again

A hundred Japanese
A family of Hindus
And a lot of Portugese

Of showing them you're boss
When they drag you through the city streets
And naiI you to a cross

They took him to the office
They strapped him to the bed
They fastened lots of pretty wires
Securely to his head
They wheeled him down the corridor
Upon a metal trolley
Now he wears big spectacles
And he sings like Buddy Holly

I could never see the point
Of showing them you're boss
When they drag you through the city streets
And nail you to a cross

And took away his guns
And now he satisfies himself

Oh oh at the disco

And Rome is very grand
But the Pope lost his four fingers
When they gave this boy his hand to kiss
When they gave this boy his hand to kiss
It wasn't funny no

He wasn't very good at school
His highest grade was C
But he believed the managers
When they said: ""you leave it all to me""
They gave him suits from Saville Row

So now he sits in the desert wastes
Just waiting for the sign

See that girl there tapping her toes?
Nervous, crying out ""Hallelujah""
She wipes her tears on the sleeve of her coat
Dries her eyes, but spills a cherry cola


I bet some guy gave her that frown
I'd love to turn it around


Oh, that girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero


It's like her hands are up, out of a smoky window
Saying, ""Save me from this burning building""
It's like she's cornered in a darkened alley
Helpless in a world full of villains


She's tired of running away
Here I come to save the day


Oh, that girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero

Oh, I'm stepping in, I'm stepping in

True love is a golden ring
Like the vows we made it's a precious thing
Sent from above on silver wings
True love is a golden ring


Down a winding road with many turns
Through fire and smoke and bridges burned
I've held my share of stranger's hands
Now holding yours, I understand


True love is a golden ring
Like the vows we made it's a precious thing
Sent from above on silver wings
True love is a golden ring


Love is so much more than a one-night stand
Like the endless turn of a wedding band
Looking in your eyes I see the truth
After all this time I found you


True love is a golden ring

Well, I saw it advertised one day
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way
""Come along and take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and family
Bring the whole kids""
Yippee


Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
To this thing called the Bear Mountain picnic
Little did I realize
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise
Had nothing to do with picnic
Didn't come close to a mountain
And I hate bears


Took the wife and kids down to the pier
There was six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
""Oh well,"" I said ""it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier""


Well, we all got on, and what do you think?
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept a-piling on
That old ship was a-going down
Funny way to start a picnic


Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife
So many people, I never saw in my life
That old ship was sinking down in the water
There was six thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming
Women a-yelling, men a-flying, fists a-flying
Paper flying, cops a-coming, me a-running
Maybe we just better call off the picnic


I got shoved down, got pushed around
All I remember was a moanin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
All I remember is waking up on the shore
My arms and legs were broken
My feet were splintered
My head was cracked
I couldn't walk
I couldn't talk, smell, feel
Couldn't see
Didn't know where I was
I was bald
Quite lucky to be alive though


Well, feeling like I just climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife and kids and started home
Wishing I'd never got up that mornin'


Now, I don't care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic, that's up to you
But don't tell me about it, I don't want to hear it
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic
Have a picnic in the bathroom


Well, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
There's a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebody's money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat, send them up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic

If I could get out of my mind
If I could forget about me
If I could forget about time

If I could forget about life
If I could shut up about me
If I could knock it out of my mind
Every once in a while
I might begin to see you
Hear you, feel and understand you
Instead of being hundred miles from you
When I'm sitting in the same room

Gathering disease, disease

Alright now
You know what time it is 

Put your hands on ya, hands on ya

Outlawz in this muthafucka

Fatal


There go my enemies, my heart beat, pump with ease
So I bust instead of waiting for you punks to squeeze
Give you all of my 3 pound rounds, so you can fall
Bit the fact that Outlawz just kicked down your door
Bitch niggas be fouling out, hacking me with them wack rhymes
Grabbing ya .9, shooting scared, tryin' to take mine
I'm putting pressure on you niggas when I mobb
Deep bringing the heat to your dirty ass squad
You can ride, point blank range, peep game
From the , contaminated criminal Hussein
Bitch nigga I'm caught at project steps with the Tec
Murder next, and rob any nigga any set
Hussein, the type of muthafucka dying with trey pounds
Ghetto types we drown, hollow points from the waist down


We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us


Now, as I approach the scene, from smoking green, got my eyes closed
Niggas I call 'em my foes, I make 'em die froze
Watch me make 'em bleed, makin' G's, Lord help me with it
Got me painting pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
See me and pray for options, but the pressure's non stop
Niggas get to pistol poppin', then watch the body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit yo set, flash on
Blast on them bitch made niggas with my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seeing demons hittin' weed, got me hearing screams
Scared to go to sleep, I watch the scene like a dope fiend
Probably be punished for it, although you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas past the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for, I got the secrets of war


We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus

Kadafi, we do this thug life shit like 4 5 6 dick 'em
Down with no rounds left up in the pound when it sounds
Squeeze the lead off!, I blow his motherfuckin' head off!
Signal all the other Outlawz, as soon as shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain’t a cop here to stop me
These streets is black Hockey, your MOB? weak and sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass pre-style grammar
Locked in the slammer while I’m layed cocked cocked back like a hammer
Y'all newly wed’s throwing honeymoons, well times about up
Dummys I Leave no trace found with you face down stuck
Your biggest cannons couldn’t come close to touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt puttin' in work on your block tipsy


We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus

Check the murder rate percentage, niggas is finished
Getting blood checks from clinics, this thug shit is in us
Flowing through my system, you a victim, blunts.. I twist them
Fuck the whole world it’s us against them
You got the heat? Pull it out, and cock the hammer if you with it
Don’t make no difference here, with a 25-to-Life sentence
We already doing life on the street, like Al G
Niggas be heated when they walking the beat
This shit is Flakey, making fags shaky, Niggas hate me
Scared to face me, knowing that the Outlawz raised me!
Put me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I flex my money muscle, all the cheese got doubled
Moving shit like a dolly, beating niggas like Rodney
Turn a killa like Gaddafi if the new street is 


We go to war we bust if we must, plus

Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within a mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight


Yeah, back my lines of a linebacker
Every song I hit, you gon' need a chiropractor, when you're spine's fractured
Far as the  rap scene, I'm a vital factor
You challengers ain't prepared for the title match-up
I got an idol stature, so if I catch ya
And  snipers shootin' rifles atcha
That's it, the final chapter, your book is over
Gained full speed in the game and took it over
I'm the reason whoever leadin' is lookin' over
Their shoulder, they slowin' down and they lookin' older
And my mind's at a veteran stage
It make 'em sick when I tell 'em my age
Homie, I run this town, like the mayor in  truck
Yep, catch up, playa, I been about bucks
Soundwave all-star, starter for the champagne
Stop hatin' and be a part of the campaign


Is who's gon' run this town tonight


Yeah, D-Pryde
I feel the rush from the crowd, feelin' extra fly
, we run it, you better recognize
All these rappers sound identical; Gemini
When you see the squad peel off like a clementine
You never gettin' pride, that ain't an option, pal
In the zone and I own it, I got a proper sound
I'm known as cocky now, but in this game
When the people see I'm modest, they honestly come and knock ya down
Get a check, I'm not an amateur, yo
I'm the same, never change when the cameras close
Tryin' not to get hurt,  threats worse
Sayin' that you run homie, ask for my consent first
W'sup


Tra-phic
So funny how the haters tell you, ""You lose""
But every day they try to watch me up on YouTube
Tryin' to bite my style, smile and their tooth loose
Used to call me Gin, now they don't; I'm that new juice
Click on my face, add the MySpace
Everybody hatin', but I'm eatin' good on my plate
And this the new RatPack, I do it my way
What you think I rap for? To only get like 5 plays?
Bitch, you can check my statistics
I'm workin' to the bone like a shirt from the Misfits
If you don't like this, you can Google it
Too hot, big in the  Ramen Noodle shit
What the future holds, only the Lord knows
I snatch the mic like  at award shows
But hold on, I'ma let you finish your rhyme
But this collaboration is the greatest of all time


Is who's gon' run this town tonight


We are, yes I said it, we are
This is Ahmirica, pledge your allegience
Make sure you're hearin' us, we gon' get what we want
One day they'll look back and figure out how we won


One

Of the few groups on the scene where every member can sing

Two

Much determination, we hustlin'  'til we reach that dream

Three

We got the internet game on lock, that's why you watchin' us bring

Four

Vocalists, one manager, one engineer on this dream team
So...


Give death to the auto-tune
That'll make our competition's lack of skills audible
Ay, I scratch my head to the follicle
Could it be we have no competition? That's plausible

So consider this  to you
We gon' keep doin' what we was gonna do
We got the drive and the fortitude
You can keep talkin' 'cause Ahmir is ignorin' you


Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within a mile
Almost there, don't give up now

This is for my sister
She fresh off of the bus
Can't lie I really missed her
I'm glad she came back to us
Left home with a early mind state
Family life turned sideways
90's had a higher crime rate
There's a whole lot to discuss
Broken families caused casualties
So the offspring formed their own thing
It's a gangster party now west side of town
In the rider now what you think
Putting in work, piece in her purse
And she got hands make her feel her hurt
But lighten up the mood
Respected by the dudes
Living in the dark but lightens up the room



In and out
Straight from the bottom now to the top
Do you believe that I'm here to stay
I will not turn no I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay



Now my sister went from
Trapping and robbing too
Who wanna problem, you?
We can resolve it
She can recall
The day she had her first born
For a moment felt so transformed
Single mother with her heart torn
Not sure what she should do
Why call it crime, they became the hustle tho
Hard to be living all kinds of broke
Check fraud was the best job
For somebody who ain't had they diploma
That came along with prison time
Hard drugs missing line
Her mind before she could realise
A decade went by of missing time



In and out
Straight from the bottom now to the top
Do you believe that I'm here to stay
I will not turn no I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay



Now I done seen her come in and out
Several times been to prison now
This time, claims it's different now
Coz she's chosen to go a different route
Well aight, we gone see
I be sceptical man that's me
What unfolded right before my eyes
These past eighteen months could only be described
As a move of God
She's finally free
Been sober for like two years now
Ain't even tempted to smoke weed
And the scales finally fell from her eyes
She did the work coz she recognised
Everything she lost she get it back
Reconciled with every one of her kids in fact
They love her as a mom
Happy to meet the siblings
They never knew existed
She continues building this life for herself
While I just wanna spoil my niece with attention, joy in my world
Happy her and Levi would grow up together
Holidays and road trips can't get any better
Tryna think how I can get my sister involved
Coz she's way more than just my sister in law
She reminds me why I've been doing this all
Impressing to the Lord even though it's been hard
And who would have thought such inspiration
Would come from a life that's been so tainted
It's been hard yeah we know it's true
But God takes our crooked sticks and makes em adjacent
Puts people in our lives for motivation
From unlikely places
This Is my thank you



In and out

So old they could not stand

But now it seems her acid visions have come and changed that face

She says I'm hallucinating
Queen in my pictures

She's drawing demon clusters on her stucco walls
And hanging all her clothing from her mother's ceiling

Now I'm hallucinating
Queen in my pictures

All the handsome fellas used to want to hold her hand
But now she's finding it hard to find a loving man

She spoke to me in her disconnected rhyme

I'm so tired of good health
I'm so tired of this roof and my bed
I'm so tired of cooked food and good moods
And good coup with AC to cruise
So tired of myself, my word and my wealth
Too big is my heart, too small are my cares
Then she said...
I'm so tired of making love
I'm so tired of being kissed
I'm so tired of making money
I'm so tired of this kush in my spliff, it don't make sense
I'm so tired of my family, my friends
I'm so tired of one night stands
So tired of living lavish, two birds in one nest
And being notorious


Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there


I'm so tired of this scene
I'm so tired of this ocean, this breeze
So tired but can't close my eyes to find sleep
So tired of this dream 
Your smile, your charm
Your patience, loyalty
Your love...ain't you tired of me?
To have it all, but not at all complete
Wanting you is all that ever drives my being
That never-ending, ever-tempting, tipping-over
All my energy...
It's all that ever drives my being


Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there

Don’t call my name out your window, I’m leaving

Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut

See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure

Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
Turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You waited, hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow reckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away


When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now 
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light


An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid to turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind and
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory


When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now 
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light


Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you


When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now 
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light
Don't ignore
Listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light

Being in love is hard

That’s the only way we’ll ever stand a chance
So I ain’t taking orders from a man, You got to understand
See I can work with you, long as you are true
Change out the blue and I’ll start taking interviews
Let me give you a list of my demands, never raise your hand

Headed somewhere north of where you are
Thought I knew where I was going

And every time I close my eyes the angels are singing
Loving you ain't my decision
Loving you is my religion


I wanna hear what's been hurting
I carve that on a bench in Central Park
And when I showed up there the next day
You'd written your initials in a heart


Ain't gonna lie I've been drinking

And every time I close my eyes the angels are singing
Loving you ain't my decision

The first time I saw your face
You walked up and said
I hate this place
I said, I do too
We stayed up and talked til dawn
Every night all summer long
Figuring out how to get along
Then it all fell through
And then the leaves fell too


We had sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Baby, baby, we had sweet love
Just cause we got off track
Don't mean we can't get back
Baby, baby to that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love


I know the third time's a charm
But you and I ain't gonna go that far
Cause if I get you back in my arms
I ain't letting go again
Cause all of my sleepless nights
They're just a waste of time
Without you I'm living a lie
And it's a lonely sin
So let's dive back in


To that sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Baby, baby, to that sweet love
Just cause we got off track
Don't mean we can't get back

So come on, come on
Give me one more try girl
A love like ours
Shouldn't never die, girl
So come on, come on
Bring it back to life, girl
Cause I ain't gonna lose it
Another time
Oh, sweet love

"I came by myself to a very crowded place;
I was looking for someone who had lines in her face
I found her there but she was past all concern;
I asked her to hold me, I said, ""Lady, unfold me,""
But she scorned me and she told me
I was dead and I could never return

Well, I argued all night like so many have before
Saying, ""Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more.""
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor
She said, ""Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me
Just win me or lose me
It is this that the darkness is for.""

I cried, ""Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old
The stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold.""
""If we cry now,"" she said, ""it will just be ignored.""
So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning
I could hear my lady calling
""You've won me, you've won me, my Lord
You've won me, you've won me, my Lord
Yes, you've won me, you've won me, my Lord
Ah, you've won me, you've won me, my Lord

What up everybody, so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention

Now I wanst to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk

When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know

1 2 3, it's like A B C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass




If you got beef, then nigga eat a pork chop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I break like anti-locks, panties drop
From hood to hood, block to block

Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night

My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a jheri curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on, now whatcha gonna do, so

Grab your partner, do se do
If you don't know who it is, it's Coolio
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass



Rhyme 3:
Push, push, in the bush
But don't step on my toes cuz you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre

Comin' at 'em with pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip cuz I don't want to have to gat 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy
The way you shake that ass, always amaze me

Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give the nigga his props

I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

He kicks the shit out of her because he’s heartless
She won’t leave she has low self esteem
He’s got gravitational pull
Sucks her body till her heart and her limbs grow cold

Hang in there use your head
How can i love you after you’re dead
Hang in there keep trying
How can i love you after dying

Here’s what you got to tell him
I’m thinking of a picture that’s keeping me in stitch
You’re causing me a mental glitch
‘Cause jealousy is such a bitch
I hereby emancipate myself from that
You can consider yourself free to flirt and chat
With whoever you want
It should have always been that way
The way that you flaunt the way that you play
My mind is blank slate i’m pretending you’re erased
You cannot let me down when i cannot see your face

CHORUS

Ode to a beat up girl, i know you’re out there
Stronger than you think, stand up if you care
Get up off the ground, don’t let me down
Get up off the ground, don’t let me down

CHORUS

And you, i’m a let you pass without kicking you’re ass
Because i’m above it you hurt someone i love
It takes two to make a thing go right and that’s trite
But one just to sneak and weasel through the night
If you hurt her again i’ll fuck you up
If you hurt her again i’ll fuck you up, fuck you up
If you hurt her again i’ll fuck you up
If you hurt her again i’ll fuck you up, fuck you up

It's a fact homie, eagles don't fly in flocks
But the eagles I got hold sixteen shots
Like beefin', homie I ain't sayin' a word
I'll run up on your punk ass squeezing the bird
Now what New York niggas know about country grammar
Not much, but we know how to bang them hammers
When I pull out that thing, you better break yourself
Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
If you lucky motherfucker, I'm solider I told ya
Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin' the dust
Five point O, burnin' the clutch, while I'm burnin' the dutch
You thought them other niggas was hot, I'm turnin' it up
This the blueprint, nigga are you learnin' or what
You done told them you respect me, now tell them I'm the nicest
Admit it nigga, I'm a mid-life crisis


 G-UNIT! I started my own gang
 G-UNIT! 
 G-UNIT! I started my own gang

It's like niggas rate the respect of who gat bigger
Banks been blowin' on purple stuff before that fat nigga
Pennies make dollars, and dollars make death threats
I'm doin' remixes to bulletproof the Lex next
Duck nigga, everyday's war
I'm heavy on sports, so my drawer's like the NBA store
Don't make me send the piece at you
I'll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
Look creampuff, you can get killed here
Nigga you ain't invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
I've always been a picky man, but I ain't a flowered star
So I'mma fuck all fifty fans
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
All in your grill, wearin' the crown, airin' em down
We're in the pound puttin' fear in the clown
I'm running with gangstas, don't make one of em shank ya

I'mma ride with my rap shit and my body armor
Ride like a Taliban suicide bomber
Four five six feet, I off ya feet
I kill ya with a pillow when you fall asleep
Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line
So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
I jump out with a nina and a mack
I have you like Khia, my neck, my back

So I heard the bad news
Nobody likes me and I'm gonna die alone
In my bedroom
Looking at strangers on my telephone
Well, wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you like if I believed those words?
If I'm born to lose
I'll never try and I will never learn, but


I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
""Don't leave me now, don't leave me now""
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
""Don't leave me now,"" and I turn around like


""Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan""


So here's the bad news
I'm coming for everyone and I'm coming on strong
New hair and new shoes
Yeah, I get what I like because I do what I want


I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
""Don't leave me now, don't leave me now""
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
""I won't leave you now,"" and I turn around like

Are you gonna believe that I can do it?

You've been clapped and in fact there's no coming back from that

Just my vest and my semi in the back of the Bentley

Don't say I'll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it's not true
I know you're seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby


I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby


You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?


I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news


I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, ""Maybe""


You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself

They call shots, I call audibles

And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors

'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse

Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me

Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

It was late last night when the boss came home
To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said: “Boss, the lady’s gone
She left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”


“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man
Come to the point as straight as you can”
“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand”


The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late


“Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by, put up a prayer” 


Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
Eastward, long down the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went


He came to a place where the light was dull
His forehead pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain


Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
He renounced his faith, he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all


He leaned down, cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
It was hard to tell for certain who was who


He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quaking in every vein
His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair


They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit, inseparably linked
“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by” 
“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly” 


From behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race


She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
With a hatred that could hit the skies
“You’re a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise” 


“Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench
And cover your face or suffer the consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes back on, double-quick” 


“Silly boy, you think me a saint
I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint
You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes” 


“I’d have given you the stars and the planets, too
But what good would these things do you?
Bow the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world you’ll see” 


“Oh, please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold” 
“Oh, my dear, you must be blind
He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind” 


“You’ve had your way too long with me
Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be” 
“Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed
‘You’ll have to try to get past me first” 


“Do not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you, sir, you can not deny
You made a monkey of me, what and for why?” 


“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you, I’ll see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died” 


The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
First bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin


He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead


“You shot my husband down, you fiend” 
“Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?
He was a man of strife, a man of sin
I cut him down and threw him to the wind” 


This she said with angry breath
“You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life” 
Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife


His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife
If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife” 


“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But we’re no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men, as all wives know” 
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow


His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt” 


She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
“You died for me, now I’ll die for you” 
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through


All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day

Ayo, Bo knows this,  and Bo knows that 
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there 
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know


Yes yes y'all 
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all

Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve rotates the gates
 Can I get a hit? 
Boom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me! Yo, what's the scenario?


 Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape crushed grapes apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah-, an -eader, simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later, , later, alligator
Pop goes the weasel and the herb's the inflater
So yo the D what the O, incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound? 


It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here 
Never on the left 'cause my right's my good ear 
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no 
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test, the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did


I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear


You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario


Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact  from the cannon!
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine!
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When digging in the mind library
Oh-my-gosh! Oh my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Roar, raow, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants were saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync  the rhymes are on time 
Ripping up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands


Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where your come from no-one knows
Nomad, where you go to no-one tells


Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No-one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told


Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where your come from no-one knows
Nomad, where you go to no-one tells


No-one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no-one's seen you kill


Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius


Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone


Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius


Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no-one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us

No man ever understood your genius

Wrapped my head around somethin' you said I didn’t know

When there's really no reason or no problems

There are just too many
Times that people
Have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you
And I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I’ve
Held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind
Afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you’ve said about me when I’m not around
You think having the upper hand
Means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I’ve had too many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine


One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

And then it's all gone


So many people like me
Put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think
To just say what we feel inside
So many people like me
Walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want
Is to feel like I’m not stepped on
There are so many things you say
That make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall
And I’m counting down the time
'Cause I’ve had so many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I’m waiting until the upper hand is mine


One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

And then it's all gone


And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
Now it's all gone


I know I’ll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide use, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall


One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

One minute, you’re on top

Making your heart stop

And then it's all gone

Tu che illumini le stelle
E che ogni cosa puoi

E fai splendere nel cielo
Il sole per noi

Tu che piangi per chi ha fame
E per chi ti ucciderà
Ma perché ci hai dato tutta questa libertà

Eppure ogni cosa sapevi tu
Dei nostri bei cuori
Che venduto t'avrebbero quaggiù
Per un pugno di denari

Tu che mostri all'aurora
Questo luogo dove sta

Per poter scrutar la terra dalle sue estremità

Perché non alzi la tua voce
Sulla nostra libertà
Che in un baratro profondo
Noi portandoci sta

Il tuo silenzio ci fa smarrir nel gelo della notte
E anche per questo tu piangi già: come puoi amarci ancora?

Ma tu
Continui, continui
Ad amare chi ti ucciderà
Tu che sei il padre del tuono
Del sole e della pioggia

Celentano:
Tu sei proprio stravagante
Forse accorto non ti sei
Ma è da un po' che io ti studio
Dentro i sogni miei

Il tuo è solo un bel discorso
Che inizio quel giorno che fu
Quando la luce del tuo volto
Arrivo fin quaggiù

Coro:
E questo discorso finirà
Quando l'uomo distrutto avrà
L'amore del tuo immenso splendor
Che irradiava questa umanità

Ma tu

Ad amare chi ti ucciderà
Tu che sei il padre del tuono
Del sole e della pioggia

No, let me--I gotta talk about what happened to me


See where we're from, it's all or nothing

Swear to god if you come up in my mama yard
I’mma shoot that motherfucker till it get tired
Big dually truck got six tires, big ties when I rhyme mixtapes
And I keep shitting on the competition, I'm about to put out me out a shit tape
Guess we ain't playin' by no rules, every night I freestyle on Pro Tools
Tell Flex come to the A we'll carjack him by one of them regular ass old schools
I don't respect my elders, these right here Maison Margiela
I cannot get no earrings, it'll make my Rolex jealous
I been a felon since fifteen, my expedition had a big screen
Half you niggas was constipated, half you niggas wasn't shit then
Zone one all the way to zone six, fuck y'all, I'll buy my own shit
Fuck y'all, I'll buy my own whip, fuck y'all, I'll buy my own brick
Tell them pussy niggas that ain't pay shit ""Better be ready to let the gat loose""

Work hard, play hard, work hard again
My bankroll had twins, can you comprehend?
Seafood lover, I don't eat pork
Used to hit them J's like a 3-point, my partner mascot is a pitchfork
And you already know what this for - me too, rent due
Doggin' these hoes like a shih tzu so cold I recorded in a igloo
Nigga asked me why I don't drink, man, let me tell you what the wine do
My partner came in and said ""This my girl"", I had to tell that motherfucker ""Mine too!""
Court dates in the summertime, might pull up in a vert
No matter what the charges is, I'mma pull off with a smirk
This right here for Old Nat, this right here for Godby Road
This right here for Riverdale, trappin' at the Stop-N-Go
Trappin' at the Texaco, it was Amaco before it was BP
My plug from Mexico, he fell out when he seen me on TV
Sold drugs to my loved ones and it's hard for me to admit it

The nexus is concealed
In the blackbirds ornate songs
Lo, it is revealed
Clandestine in the oaks
Majestic crown

Of kindness it is known

There is an urging call
In the unexpected chance
A beckon from Lugus' hall
In the bliss of true love
There is foreboding
And in suffering

At twilight's call

Twenty more kids were stood inside and that made thirty-five
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

Sunday morning woke up yawning, filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the glass and looked in the mirror just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
'cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

"Your strange love was what I found
On  the day the rains came down
I  remember we found shelter in the cave
With the rain clouds up above
In the darkness we found love
On  the day the rains came I became your slave

When  the rains made rivers swell I fell deeper in your spell
You took my hand and handed me a crown
Oh,  if I could just live on with these things I have known
I know that I'd be glad of what I’ve found

I put on long pants
I go down on Fannin Street and I goes into the bellhouse
The chicks is all again a-jumpin' around me and drinkin'
And I was sittin' there thinking
He says, ""what is you thinkin' about?""
I said, ""I'm settin' up a tune about Fannin Street""
He said, ""Let's hear it""

My mama told me
""Women in Shreveport, son
Gonna be the death of you""

I told my mama
""Mama, you don't know me
Women in Shreveport kill me
Why don't you let me?""

I broke my mama's heart
When I broke my mama's heart, she come in a-cryin'

I couldn't stand to hear my mama cryin', I go and fall on my knees
And beg her pardon for the words I said
I went to my mama, fell down on my knees
Crying, ""Oh, Lordy, mama
Will you forgive me, please?""

Make an honest living by the working of her tail

Through the clouds like a moonbeam

And you wore nothing more than your raven hair
In the air like a moonbeam

With your eyes and your silver touch
Shone a little bit of light there
Now the darkness don’t scare me much

We can dance to the beat while I tap my feet

I was drifting through time and space
But I landed on a moonbeam
Take me out of this place


The world is dark the night is long
I could use a few laughs and a couple of songs
The sun will rise above the hills
You’ll be leaving me soon, like hell you will
The awe when gazing at the moon
Is the feeling that I get when I’m lookin’ at you
The sun will rise and fade the star

Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away


Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own


There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day


Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world

And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

How do you mend when you're worlds apart?
Ooh, carry on
Ooh, from the start
Somehow, we fell in love, then fell right out of touch

So, now, how can we both forget
Tellin' each other, ""We’re the one""?

Go to a place that we don't know so well

Try some new seduction 
Show each other how

Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise
Oh the flowers of the city
Though breath-like
Get death-like at times
And there’s no use in trying
To deal with the dying
Though I cannot explain that in lines


Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I’m in
But it grieves my heart, love
To see you trying to be a part of
A world that just don’t exist
It’s all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this


I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With the worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between staying and returning
Back to the South
You’ve been fooled into thinking
That the finishing end is at hand
Yet there’s no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad


I’ve heard you say many times
That you’re better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you gotta' be just like them


I’d forever talk to you
But soon my words
Would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there's no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows, baby
I’ll come and be crying to you

It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten


It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive


Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal


It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive


I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say


It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive


It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke

I've given up everything in exchange for being alone
I'm shaking these demons underneath all the pride, oh-woah


 Can you imagine, the weight of a world
 Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world?
 And no one can reach you , ooh
 So no one can help you now 


It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down 
I'm standing up , but I'm fallin' down 
Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down 
Someone pick me up  'cause I'm fallin' down 
Fallin' down  down  down  down 
Fallin' down  down  down  down
Fallin' down  down  down  down 
Fallin' down  down  down  down

Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame
We always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill
Jovial neighbours come down when they will
With stories to tell
Sometimes they do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do
Our tongues turn blue


Sisotowbell Lane
Anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing
Everyday in everyway
Sometimes it is spring
Sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing
Sometimes we try
Yes we always try
We have a rocking chair
Somedays we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do
We like the view


Sisotowbell Lane
Go to the city you'll come back again
To wade through the grain
You always do
Yes we always do
Come back to the stars
Sweet well water and pickling jars
We'll lend you the car
We always do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window
Sometimes we do
We wait for you

"Headed down life's crooked road, lots of things I never knowed
Because of me not knowin', I now pine
Trouble got in the trail, spent the next five years in jail
Should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

When I got right to the place where it said 'about face'
I thought that all my worries were behind
But the farther I go, the more sorrow I know
Should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign
Let's go

When I got stuck in the mud all my hopes dropped with a thud
I guess that my heart strings were made of twine
No willpower to get from the hole I'm in yet
Should have read that detour sign

I just can't seem to find the strength no more
I crawl between the piano keys
Searching for a melody

Hold on when the world has turned its back on me
I hold on when there's nothing left to say or do

Just to let me rest my eyes
When I'm begging for release my heart whispers softly
Let him go in peace

Hold on when the world has turned its back on me

Or am I the fool

Can we make it through
Just talk to me
Take away my pain

Hold on when the world has turned its back on me
I hold on when there's nothing left to say or do

Fuck around and hit Sin City, tell that bitch to pop it
What's up with you and Purrp? I ain't into all of that gossip
He brought the funk into my crew,  you gotta ask Rocky about it

Don't mean no fucking thing when I pull up in that Goyard
Shooked up from that toe star, ask questions like Nardwuar
Like can you feel your fucking legs? I bet that nigga cannot walk
Persian bitch stack coke hard, sniff white 'till her nose soft
I fucked that bitch with no rubber, cause that bitch be so raw
Puff-puff when the semi pump, nigga really gonna pop
Trunks when you see me duck, niggas really want
Y'all punks can't see the God trap, Trini' Lord
And I click like Donkey Kong when I hit this long
Better run when you see the mob, you be seeing God
Hear the drum when my niggas march, you gon' see Allah
You the son of a bitch nigga, you daddy a broad
You a bitch, little bitch nigga, probably wearing bras

E so tornato alle cinque
Pian piano sotto le lenzuola
Non la volevo svegliar
Ma l'abat-jour che è vicino a lei
S'illuminò come gli occhi suoi
Lei mi guardo, io non parlai
Io non parlai e come Giuda la baciai
Ehi, ehi, ehi
Io non giocai quella notte a poker
Ma sono stato insieme alla sua amica
Guardando me sembrava che
Lei mi leggesse la verità
E con la mano accarezzandomi le labbra
Mi perdonava quel che lei non saprà mai
Io amo lei, soltanto lei
Ma perché mai l'avrò tradita

La sera dopo sono uscito
Per fare il solito poker
Avrei voluto che venisse
Ma lei mi ha detto di no
""vai pure, vai, io rimango qui
Gli amici tuoi son tutti la
Sveglia sarò quando verrai
Quando tu verrai"" e poi mi disse sorridendo
""ehi, ehi, ehi
Al poker sai, non si gioca in tre
E non giocare più con la mia amica""
Dagli occhi suoi cadeva giù
Un lacrimone tinto di blu
E con la mano accarezzandole le labbra
Le dissi ""grazie amore mio"" e la baciai

Io amo lei, soltanto lei
Ma perché mai l'avrò tradita
Oh oh oh...

I was ten years old
When our days ceased to shine
No, you could not take a breath
When those black blizzards came
Strippin' land in dire need of rain

There was dirt on the floor
As mama swept all day long
Leavin' trails of tears and mud down her face
There was dirt in our beds
And there was dirt in our clothes
And there was dirt in the little that we ate

We had heard about the market's fall
A couple years before
But the fields and the harvest all seemed fine
Sometimes the things that kill us
That which we don't know
That strip the land of everything but pride

Stay close together
That's all we knew to get by
I recall a helpless feelin'
First time that I saw my father cry
Lookin' back on everything we had, on everything we lost
Still makes me wonder was stayin' worth the cost?

But the town folk up and left
They boarded up the schools and banks and the churches
And that, to me, was wrong
Come next year, it would be better
Will the last one standin' tall before the walls
Show the most resolve?

They announced the New Deal
With the Conservation Act and then the Relief Fund
But we were on our knees
There was little hope by then
So we just stood there in that line
And we thanked the man for that little bit of cheese

Stay close together
That's all we knew to get by
How I recall a helpless feelin'
The first time that I saw my father cry
Lookin' back on everything we had, onn everything we lost

And everything feels so different now
Just grab a hold of my hand
I will lead you through this wonderland

Water up to my knees
But sharks are swimming in the sea
Just follow my yellow light
And ignore all those big warning signs


Somewhere deep in the dark
A howling beast hears us talk
I dare you to close your eyes
And see all the colors in disguise

Running into the night
The earth is shaking and I see a light
The light is blinding my eyes

Walk out and say goodbye away from me

Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said ""would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me? I'm feeling a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""


So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said ""when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead""
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

The sum of my parts
To give it away
New life in a day
Some new Frankenstein
Damned for all time

Cursed by the Angel who fell
Who saves me from Hell?
And who is my God?
And where is my soul?
Too tired to jump, too young to run


Never-ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start


Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man


I want to end my life now
But I don't know how
Recycled again, a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The Devil has planned

Thinking bout shots
And how it barely grazed me
And it coulda hit Rock
And a couple of other niggas
But they all roll on my block
Machiavelli from Harlem
How you wanna be Pac
Wanna be a jiggy nigga
From the East coast right
The beast coast right
I know you feelin the feet close right
You know I can see it in ya face
Your teeth all tight
Well Flex got beats
We can beef all night
Schoolboy you better School ya boy
Hit you wit the ruler boy
I'm the new 50 cent I will fucking Ja rule ya boy
Chillin to Shabba Ranks
Fo're I hit you with the tooler boy
Hit em with the chopsticks
And fucking Tai fool ya boy
I don't sell rocks
Nigga I smoke em
Bobby selling crack and thats no joking
The beat had me laced
I started West coast-in
Shit was too potent
And now I'm ready to poke somethin'
Rock you wanna know sumn?
Sherane got good brain
A couple Harlem niggas
Said that bitch up in the chicken wing
You top dog I heard you in a lick of things
A Hollywood bully where you

End of conversation I'm running out of patience
You can't play me they don't play me on the station
Ain't no debatin', rappers get eaten
Keep it on the low I fucked your girl in the basement
Down for anything, but I don't fall for Nathan
I go to the jewelery store for a vacation
Celebration, dedication
I rob a nigga in his sleep, Freddy mixed with Jason
They got me paranoid all these different faces
I know somebody the police I can fucking taste it
Mmm mmm mmm, I can smell a rat
Fire, fire, fire, let them feel the gat
O O O O that's a quarter pack
Nigga four Os nigga throw like a quarterback


Small things to a giant, its too easy
Just got dressed I'm colder than the flu season
Its too easy its too easy

I do this in my sleep I need to change the covers
Menage a trois and I dont change the rubbers
Nasty nigga so dont ask a nigga
Black and ashy flashy with charisma
A pack of cigarillos and 2 liter
And that's just for two people
Trynna get numb nigga cuz my feelings hurt
Dealing work I'm a go to jail I keep killing verses
I got a hard top I'm about to convert
Bought her ass a bag and paid they phone service
Name brand head to toe walking in strokers
Two girls on my coat walking out of strokers
Its a small thing the big foot
That's why I stalk my money taller, the six foot
And I'm motivated to get more of it
Rich nigga getting private dances in public




I say its too easy me and two Breezys
Everything around me sick, flu season
Got the minis popping pack doing them calisthenics
Pack of bitches trynna make a movie for the final edit
Shouts out to my bad bitch that red ho with them tattoos
That fat ass and them green eyes got green guys my trap boom
Got work to sell got pounds of kush
Break it down got ning dings
Got nine hoes need nine mo, roster Bruce Springsteen
That mac 11 start talking fast
That paper stacking like Kinkos
Blowing strong popping bands
These niggas stealing our lingo
And I'm TRUed up got two cups
Me and 2 Chainz go too nuts
Two guns and I'm deuced up

Low pro crew cut
She fuck with me then my crew fuck

I wanna leave out of here, take 'em back to the crib
And show them how to do the chocha, hit it like a Sosa

All this bottle popping got me feeling nicely
Leaving by myself is highly unlikely
Looking for a right now, don't need no wifey
Settling down with one chick, that ain't even like me

Gotta leave with at least three and a pair 
The look in they eyes telling me that they want it
Don't like it that much to put a ring on it

Front page of the magazine said
""Don't believe a word you read, I'm just telling lies, just telling lies""
Fall short this time of goals you rose to meet that night
Don't worry yourselves, worry yourselves
We can carry ourselves, carry ourselves

How does it feel to wake up
Knowing that you're playing on something
That could have been nothing but a sad, sad song
About a group of kids who lost it all to the great big city


Are we both crazy?
Or are we searching for more than life behind the same four walls
Pour me another drink I'll commit myself to it
And lose track of reason to believe in nothing


I know this is ridiculous, that's just like me
Make the most of living while you're young
And have the chance to take your chances
Cause I've got to, I've got to go


Don't be afraid, I've got your back
When times get rough and bring you down
Maybe you don't understand
We've got to take this or break this off
It's all up to us and you better believe


We're just so crazy
We're all just searching for more
Than this life behind the same four walls
Pour me another drink, I'll commit myself to it
And lose track of reason to believe in nothing


I know this is ridiculous, that's just like me
Make the most of living while you're young
And have the chance to take your chances

When I turn 81 and forget things, will you still be proud?

You tell me that our love cannot endure

Swingin' in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothin' but that t-t-television on
We're kissin' in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you



I wonder if you'll think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say, ""You're beautiful but hopeless""

I promise that I'll think of you as the king
Quotin' Corleone like you're so mean
It's Cosa Nostra cause it's our thing



Lucy's in the sky with ice tonight
Heaven knows I've tried hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

It feels so right, baby, you're a vision in blues
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, watching television with you

I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love


To all my Brooklyn
To all my Uptown
To all my Bronx
To all my Queensbridge


Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rip it quick
And kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get
With them hoods, fatigues; with the boots with trees
Smoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga

 
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fo' sho'!


Yo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya'
Get mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., because fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Watertown or Fishscale
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-ha, yo chief, pass the buddha




When I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand
Even my P.O., she called me ""the Ginger Bread Man""
I catch a new case, and tell her ass: ""Catch me if you can""
Don't let your people fill you up with octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up, to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off proper
There's no place like home, New York! New York!
I run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly
Or sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me  ha! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit 
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!

I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
Dream about Bugattis and other four-wheels
They say Illuminati and other ordeals
Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal
And now it's more real than it is for any other star
And that's enough to have you tearing up the mini-bar
I should probably get awards where the Emmys are
For how I deal with the pap like Remy Ma
I get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now
But don't confuse how you see me have to move now
I got bars like a cypher's in the booth now
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
'Long as they get my page right on Wikipedia
'Long as they say my name right in the media
If you don't, that's a sin like Cincinnati
'Cause ever since I had the polo suit at the Grammys
I been spittin' at the camera like Trick Daddy
So swaggy, he could've broke up with IG
I ain't surprised that they broke up on IG
I got the game on IV, might as well have a live feed
Keep a fresh cut from IB
So I always match the picture in my ID
They packin' Dub C had ran with Mack 10
I was still a baby Similac then
And what the crack era did to black men
It had to be an error if you had a Cadillac then


How I rock mine, I throw it up
Makin' sure that you niggas all are on the same page
Powerful force, you better look both ways
Fuck that, I'm chokin' niggas, it's goin' down
I'm from a different cloth, we the oracles of the sounds
Skip town, hit 'em with impeccable pound
Lost, found, the way I flood it, niggas gon' drown
Rip shit—ayo, wait, wait, wait, wait—
I gotta do it again, I gotta do it again
You already know the script, roundhouse kick
She lookin' at me, lickin' her lip
Put my arm around her like a bowl of chip with a dip
With yo' bitch, what the fuck, niggas erupt
I got the half moon clip, that's banana
A good planner, a new anger like a larger Bruce Banner
Out the house, nigga, if you open your mouth
Man, nigga, if you open your mouth
Fuck the press, I'm leavin' every room in a mess
Like herds of bulls with they aprons on and bakin' soda
Keep it movin', keep the convo short
And bring a case of Henney 
House of pain, I control many 
House of lies, you niggas go run, hide
Peep the way this vibe conflict with they real lives
 Fanatic shit, we go bizarre 
Bad news for niggas as I go emphatical, radical
National animal rulin' like a czar
Every time I black for the record, the shit splatter
The whole batter, no bullshit, the boom bapper
I pull the gat up, whip the shit, cook the batter
When I pull up on niggas, even your momma gon' scatter

They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know


Can't you talk to me?
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need

Chiquitita, dime por qué
Tu dolor hoy te encadena
En tus ojos hay, una sombra de gran pena
No quisiera verte así
Aunque quieras disimularlo
Si es que tan triste estás para qué quieres callarlo


Chiquitita, dímelo tu
En mi hombro, aquí llorando
Cuenta conmigo ya, para así seguir andando
Tan segura te conocí
Y ahora tu ala quebrada


Déjamela arreglar, yo la quiero ver curada


Chiquitita, sabes muy bien
Que las penas vienen
Y van y desaparecen
Otra vez vas a bailar
Y serás feliz
Como flores que florecen
Chiquitita, no hay que llorar
Las estrellas brillan por
Ti allá en lo alto
Quiero verte sonreír
Para compartir
Tu alegría, Chiquitita
Otra vez quiero compartir
Tu alegría Chiquitita


Chiquitita, dime por qué
Tu dolor hoy te encadena
En tus ojos hay, una sombra de gran pena
No quisiera verte así
Aunque quieras disimularlo
Si es que tan triste estás para qué quieres callarlo


Chiquitita, sabes muy bien
Que las penas vienen
Y van y desaparecen
Otra vez vas a bailar
Y serás feliz
Como flores que florecen
Chiquitita, no hay que llorar
Las estrellas brillan por

Quiero verte sonreír

I make mistakes
More than I count on my fingers
We good today
Then the wrong things come and linger
Forgive and forget
But some things I just remember
I know I make mistakes
But I learn and then it's over 




That's why pencil come with eraser

Pencil come with eraser
We don't have to be paper tracers
Cause pencil come with eraser



It's gone, gone, gone, gone

This ain’t a broken heart homie singin’ only ‘cause he’s lonely
This ain’t a love song 
This ain’t a whiskey-drowned ballad
There ain’t nothing here that’s valid
So tell me baby, pretty baby, that this house is not a graveyard
Tell me how to stay strong and carry you home
Over corpses of her long-lost fathers and her unborn daughters
‘Cause Goddammit, I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone

No, I can’t do it alone


Oh no, no, I’m not impressed with you
Pink drinks that seem to get the best of you
Rock late and sleep until the sun sets
I’d talk but you took the tongue I talk with

Stepped in between the both of y'all, said ""I'm leaving, do you wanna go?""

We sold ourselves for love but now we're free

He shed his scales to find the snake within

Like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men


In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears I never faced
Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fears within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall


Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through


I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell

To shadows of the past
Take a breath and I scream attack

Nothing to cock back the Black P-80 Launcher
Any hate can haunt you, I'm straight from the L.I. gates of Yonkers
Down to the Southern states to Great Lakes in Tonker

There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry
Window's wide open African trees
Bent over backwards in a hurricane breeze
Not a word, a goodbye, not even a note
She's gone with the man in the long black coat

Somebody seem him hangin' around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance he had a face like a mask
Somebody said, from the Bible he quote
There was dust on the man in the long black coat

Preacher was talkin' there's a sermon he gave
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it's you who must keep it satisfied
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
She give her heart to the man in the long black coat

One, two...
There are no mistakes in life some people say
It's true sometimes you can see it that way
People don't live or die, people just float
She give her heart to the man in the long black coat

There's smoke on the water, it's been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted in the high crescent moon
Hear the pulse and vibrations and the rumblin' force
Somebody's out there beating on a dead horse
She never said nothin', there was nothin' she wrote

These rappers get the PJ but they don't make PJ weigh
It's sad cause it's so fake
My nigga, why you fucking your commas up?
Spending a grand on lunch
You gon' be broke with that kinda stuff
You ain't even bought your mama shit
But you gotta spend cause you wanna look rich

You out here shining on these niggas like you stainless

A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always go to show

They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them

Everybody want to be a winner
And take their place at the top
Everyone wants their name up in lights
For the good times never stop
Sometimes the bad luck will creep up and catch you by surprise
Your mind's confused, you feel misused
You've got to leave those troubles behind


Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes you wanna cry, sometimes you play the fool
You gotta hold on a little longer
And try to be a little stronger
And you can win, you can win
And everything is gonna be yours


When you cry, the whole world laughs at you
They don't seem to understand
But the time will come when the tables turn
And you're gonna have the winning hand


Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes you wanna cry, sometimes you play the fool
You gotta hold on a little longer
And gotta be a little stronger
And you can win, you can win
And everything is gonna be yours

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes...
You gotta hold on...
You gotta hold on...


When you cry, the whole wide world laughs at you
They don't seem to understand
But the time will come when the tables turn
And you're gonna have the winning hand
Sometimes the bad luck will creep up and catch you by surprise
Your mind's confused, you feel misused
You've got to leave those troubles behind

My life's a riddle
Don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal
But it's this hustle that get me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money
I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble
Beware of devils, continue strugglin'
Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way
So get your mind on official business
You can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave
So get paid
My niggas do this every fuckin' day
We parlay through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggas in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction
What's needed is unification
'Cause the world ain't hardly scared
If not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear, we'll evaporate
Say your prayers
And what's next?

"Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done
We’ve killed each one
And the table’s full and overflowed
And the corner sign
Says it’s closin' time
So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road

Oh every girl that ever I’ve touched
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever I’ve hurt
I did not do it knowingly
But to remain as friends
You need the time to make amends
And stay behind
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past
I’ll bid farewell and be down the line

Oh every foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes
Must meet the dawn
And if I see the day
I’d only have to stay
So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone

Oh, every thought that’s strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung
But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes
It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung
But the time ain’t tall, if on time you depend
And no word is possessed by no special friend
And though the line is cut
It ain’t quite the end
I’ll just bid farewell 'til we meet again

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So I’ll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn

"Myself

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give into sad thoughts that are maddening?

Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch 'em red handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?

Because I can't hold when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again, by myself

I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

I can't look around

I can't hold back


I can't slow down

I can't look back


If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on, then theyll
Take from me 'til everything is gone

If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch 'em I'll be, outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer, by myself

I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

I ask why
But in my mind I find

Watching everything spin
I can't look back

Well, the people down the road said it wasn't far
But I better know someone
'Cause when the moonshiners know I carry a star

He's telling me to give up, he's telling me to give up
I'm being taken down from the inside out

In a backstage room we heard the sound
And we all knew what we had to do

We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew

Would come for us to fight
Destination now in sight

Hold your ground and give no more

Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands and take a stand
Look sharp when duty calls
Where we march, cities fall
And the strong survive and take our side

Well, I used to drive a cab
You know
I heard a siren scream
Pulled over to the corner
And I fell into a dream
There were
Two men eating pennies
And three young girls who cried
The West coast is falling
I see rocks in the sky
The preacher took his bible
And laid it on the stool
He said: with
The congregation running
Why should I play the fool?
Well, I used to be a woman
You know
I took you for a ride
I let you fly my airplane
It looked good for your pride
Cause you're
The kind of man you know
Who likes what he says
I wonder what's it's like
To be so far over my head
Well, the lady made the wedding
And she brought along the ring
She got down on her knees
And said: Let's
Get on with this thing
Well, I used to be a folk singer
Keeping managers alive
When you saw me on a corner
And told me I was jive
So I unlocked your mind, you know
To see what I could see
If you guarantee the postage
I'll mail you back the key
Well I woke up in the morning
With an arrow through my nose
There was an Indian in the corner
Trying on my clothes
Well, I used to be asleep
You know
With blankets on my bed
I stayed there for a while
Until they discovered I was dead
The coroner was friendly
And I liked him quite a lot
If I hadn't have been a woman
I guess I'd never have been caught
They gave me back my house and car
And nothing more was said
Well, I was driving
Down the freeway
When my car ran out of gas
Pulled over to the station
But I was afraid to ask
The servicemen were yellow
And the gasoline was green
Although I knew I couldn't
I thought that I was gonna scream
That was on my last trip to Tulsa
Just before the snow
If you ever need a ride there
Be sure to let me know
I was chopping down a palm tree
When a friend dropped by to ask
If I would feel less lonely
If he helped me swing the axe
I said: No, it's
Not a case of being lonely
We have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years
I said: No, it's
Not a case of being lonely
We have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years
He said: Go get lost!
And walked towards his Cadillac
I chopped down the palm tree
And it landed on his back

Explode on they industry and fade them fools

Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?


You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, ohh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?


Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?


You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, ohh
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?


Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around
When you break?

It's the Infamous Mobb, M-O-B-B
We can't be touched nigga, can't you see 


You do you man cause me I'm 'gon do my thing, you know I do my thing
I'mma get my drink on and party like it's ok


Trust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, ""Oh no""
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go


You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it


You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go


You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it


You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I play, I stay I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets


You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control

Purple blade, red blood, $uicide
Alright, first off, I'll snatch your bitch and then swerve off
The whole time she was calling you a jerk off and calling me for the dick
I'm a slick kid
Stick quick, sneeze, and then kick them to the curb
Off to the next one
Oddy Nuff stuffing guts fucking flex and stunt
With a blunt in my mouth
With my dick in a cunt
What you bout motherfucker?
Fuck your mother from the front, from the back, licked my nuts
She was nice and sweet
But, her too, had to punt to the side of the street
You wanna fuck with me?
You gonna suck the d-i-c-k-l-m-n-o-motherfucking-p
So you see?
Ain't no fooling around fools like you
Let the siren pound
As the world go round
I put another fucking round in the middle of my head as I drop to the ground


I got diamonds in my lean
Gold plated teeth
Adderall for the cheap
Half the time I'm fucking sleep
It's the iced out, draped up, young Mel Gibson
Sippin' Bart Simpson and you begging for a mention
Trapping off the fives
Sucking on some bitches breast
Got my dick all on her breath
Got my nut all on her chest
It's that young Gucci sensei
Slickity Sloth the fucking menace
Yung Christ in the flesh

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire


A start, an end, a rise and fall
No system eternal and no one immortal
Creation, all must end in destruction
We cannot change the fate of civilization


 We build our symbols of power
 Constructs of a mortal mind
 Conquer in our brightest hour
 But then we all must fall in time


Through space and time
We can't escape this paradigm


At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire

 Over the realms of our hearts and minds
 Conscious that death is awaiting
 But even death will end in time

We can't escape this paradigm

It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire

It's the end of an empire

"We like talkin' dirty
We smoke and we drink
We're KMFDM
And all other bands stink

Our music is sampled
Totally fake
It's done by machines
Cause they don't make mistakes

We don't have no lyrics
Our message is nil
We hate all DJ's
They're makin' us ill

Whatever we tell ya
Is meant to be crap
We hate all music
And especially rap

We don't like Michael Jackson
We hate Depeche Mode
We don't care for Madonna
Or Kylie Minogue

Our records have stickers
With a warning from Tipper
Cause they're no good for kids
If we'd get her, we'd strip her

KMFDM forward
The ultimate sound
And a message from Satan
If you turn it around

You might think we're stupid
But we're way above it
We don't give a shit
And the kids just love it

We wouldn't sell to a major
For a couple of bucks

For your blindly fueled rage
I bare the brunt of your long buried pain

With my dignity in place?

Find the strength to stand up to you
Lest I stay to my limit
And take on only what is mine to

All I trigger unknowingly
A job I hold in high esteem

And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire

And it burns, burns, burns
In a ring of fire

When hearts just like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
But I jumped right in and the fire went wild

Pop a top, share a spot

Honeysuckle in your long hair

While them lines are getting twisted
And the sun is slowly sinking like a bobber tonight


And when they ask us where we're heading
We'll say somewhere where they're biting
Little secret spot hiding
When them lighting bugs are bugging
Catch a buzz and catch a feeling
Just reeling you in
Stealing kisses, just go missing
When they ask where we've been
We'll call it fishin'

Stopped in Galatoire's had a couple of beers
An' talked about the price of oysters, the coach at LSU
Then like I knew it would the conversation turned to you


He had to go and I looked at my watch, it was 1:45
I headed down Canal, the quarter was comin' alive
A man on the corner told me that Jesus was comin' soon
But I was lost in the music and the crowd, and the smell of cheap perfume


It's not good for a... a man to be alone
But, a women needs someone that, she can count on
And I... I walked down by the river in the cold gray dawn
Love is like the Mississippi, when she's gone... she's gone


The line was long at Cafe Du Monde so I walked out on the pier
Thought about all the winds and turns, and mistakes that got me here
I might as well try to change the course this old river takes
Than to go back in time when you were mine, pretend it's not late


It's not good for a... a man to be alone
But, a women needs someone that... that she can count on
And what I'd give to go back, but the current's just too strong
And love is like the Mississippi, when she's gone... she's gone

Gettin' high, I can hear the people callin'
I'm passin' by, everybody knows I'm ballin'

But it's hard, all the cuties know I'm under pressure
What do I do? Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up
And say it's cool, should I stroke
Or should I wait a while? You decide

Feels like you’re miles from here
In other towns with lesser names
Where the unholy ghost doesn’t tell
Mary or William exactly what they want to hear
You remember the house on Ridge Road
Told you and the Devil to both just leave me alone
If this is salvation, I can show you the trembling
You’ll just have to trust me. I’m scared


I am the patron saint of lost causes
Aren’t we all to you just near lost causes?
Aren’t we all to you just lost


Tommy, you left behind
Something that will mean everything right before you die
What if you gained the whole world?
You’ve already lost four little souls from your life
Widows and orphans aren’t hard to find
They’re home missing daddy who’s saving the abandoned tonight
Wish your drinking would hurry and kill you
Sympathy’s better than having to tell you the truth


That you are the patron saint of lost causes
All you are to them is now a lost cause
All you are to them is now, causes


Billy, don’t you understand?
Timothy stood as long as he could and now
You made his faith disappear
More like a magician and less like a man of the cloth
We’re not questioning God
Just those he chose to carry on His cross
We’re no better, you’ll see
Just all of us, the lost causes


Aren’t we all to you just lost causes?
Are we all to you lost?
Lost causes
So all we are to you
Is all we are, is all we are
All we are is all we are


Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?

Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?

Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?
Patron Saint, are we all lost like you?


Take what you will  and leave
Could you kill ?
If the world was on fire and nothing was left of hope or desire
And take all that I could bring forth
Is this Hell? Or am I on the floor
Over-desperate hold hands
Streaming of blood again?
And then take full weight of me
Guard my dreams, figure this out
It's me on my own. Helpless, hurting, hell
Will you stay strong as you promised?
Cause I'm stranded and bare
Meanness has washed up in all that I am
Please God take this and all
Then grace takes me to a place
Of the father you never had
Bending and breaking and tearing apart
This is not heaven, this is my Hell...

Couldn't help even if you tried
Step aside or you might just be the next contestant

Just fall to the ground again

Looked about to find out where you are
Turned around and caught your frown standing on the street
Dressed the color of your guitar
When I took you to the places I'd been to as a kid
Cities where the sidewalks never lie
We were drifting through the crowds I saw you glancing away
Terrified to meat my eyes

I hope you understande I won't be easily turned away
But if you need me to I'm happy to oblige
Well, somehow I can sense that you are lost and hesitant
In the sum of your denial
And I know too well the strain of losing someone you've tried to save
Friends of ours who feel to bitter ends
To have our best put to the test knowing that we failed them
Time and again
Failed them time and again
Failed them time and again

Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love you’s
Me and you baby
We’ll walk in their footsteps
We’ll build our own family
One day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you


And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up


This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake
But I’ll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain


And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be

And we’ll build this love from the ground up


Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ this life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still


And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up

It's days like this I wish that
I wish that I had stayed asleep
It's times like these that make it so difficult to be
The light at the end, the crack in the sky
There's no promise for release
No way for me to get away
And all I'm trying to do is breath


Searching for something more
Searching for something right
Searching for a sense of clarity
Searching for a place to die!


Days like this I really wish
I really wish I wasn't me
It's times like this that make it hard
Makes it hard to fucking see
No light at the end, no crack in the sky
Everyone ends up deceased
A life like mine makes a man
Turns a grown man to a flea




Piece by piece, I slowly fade away
I slowly drift apart
I see a different world, closing in on the future
Sorry to be so cynical but it's all I know
Piece by piece, I slowly start to change
I slowly start to change!

I will never be your type


Gambling with your working visa
You’ve got something to prove
Take a photo of the Mona Lisa
Get thrown out of the Louvre
And with vomit on your feet
Clamouring bon appetit


I die on the inside every time
You will never be alright
I will never be your type
I will never be your type


Knew that I would never be your type
Knew that I would never be your type


Hop that fence if you'd like to
Then dissolve into the night
All depends how it strikes you
Without reason, without rhyme
Let me state delicately, you’re an O and I’m AB


I die on the inside every time
You will never be alright
I will never be your type
I will never be your type

How'd did you get so young? I heard that you were born today
Heard that you came from the sky and I just wanna say
Welcome, the world is glad you're here to stay
Have fun, it's time to give another day


Sometimes a fire can get in your way
But that ain't nothing you can't blow away


So make a wish, I have one too
I wish that I could stay with you
Wish you knew how much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you-ou-ou
It's all about you-ou-ou-ou today, today

Well done, the world is glad you're here to stay

I'm alone above the atmosphere
And no one looking up can find me here
‘Cause I can close my eyes, and disappear
When I climb the stairs, to watch the sun
Above the station walls, the colors run
To fill the swimming pool, when I am done
I am the captain of an oil tanker that travels through your veins
When the satellites hang all around
And I can finally hear the lovely sound
When all the engines in the back room die down
All the airships move across the sky
And my equipment just keeps standing by
The planets glow, and intensify
I am the pilot of a cargo airplane that travels through your veins


When you are lying half asleep in your room
Unaware if it is midnight, or afternoon
Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell
It could be raining, but then you can never tell
If you're alone in this awful downpour
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door


In the evening light, the boulevard
Conceals the nigh,t with disregard
For all the workers in the west coast ship yard
When I rearrange, the silverware
And re-install the lights, in  captain's chair
I'll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air
I am the engineer of forty freight trains that travel through your veins


When you are lying half asleep in your room
Unaware if it is midnight, or afternoon
Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell
It could be raining, but then you can never tell
If you're awake in this awful downpour
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door


When you are swimming in Miami at night
I’m all around you in the traffic and city light

All of my memories lay in the life of the highway
All of my nights in old motels and sleeping alone
All of my days on the road with no one beside me
All of my dreams of a place that I can call home


Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river
Somewhere in the sun, where the mountains make love to the sky
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm, and a family
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try


'Cause I'm tired of big cities and so tired of big city ways
Scratchin' off sunsets, and walkin' around in the maze
Some sweet taxi dancer tryin' to save me from bein' alone
Ah, it's much worse than lonely, there is no place I really belong
I want to be home


I'm leavin' this city life, in my mind I'm flyin' away
I'm leavin' tomorrow and all of the old yesterdays
I'm leavin' the trash cans, the bright lights, the telephone lines
I'm leavin' my sorrow and all of my memories behind
To see what I find


Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river
Somewhere in the sun, where the mountains make love to the sky
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm, a family
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try
Somewhere to grow older, somewhere to lay down and die

One, two


Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek


They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone


The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own


They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me""

Working on the dreams he planned to try

And she's out runnin' round

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from coming home

And wonder why the right words never come

When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question

And as the wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, cars, chain-link, and concrete

A window then grows and catches the eye
Cries out a yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top

Nothing stops in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And then the insides change, the box stays the same
The shame, shovel up the pieces of the pain

At Myrtle Beach
Where it all began

It was 102
Nothin' to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in


We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?


Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
You and me


We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right here


'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you


Watchin' that blonde hair swing

You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool

So come on, let's dive back in

Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent

From the magic in this glass

Sweat slip, time slips

Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society

Put a nigga thoughts outside of his brain

North side, hoppin' fences to riding Benz'
Either, you get a death wish or a sentence
Sell dope, or you gang bang, or you pimpin'
RAW cone, full of ambulance, that’s that OG
I’ve been getting down like a pimpin' since ‘03
She let me beat it up
I left it drippin’, that’s a slow leak
Twohoundred fifthy thou, I ain’t trippin' now
That’s a slow week


I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street

My heart is so lonely and blue
When friends ask about you why you're not around
How will I explain about you

How will I explain about you
They know I've been faithful and true
So when they start asking why you're not around
How will I explain about you

They saw us together for such a long time
They knew that I loved you so true
But now that you've gone and I'm left all alone
How will I explain about you

Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol' Red

Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail
He's a four-legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Aren’t nobody got past Red


And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes


Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evenin' run
I'd just drop him off and wait


And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes


Now Ol' Red got real used to seein'
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south


And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes


Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out

You were always trying to fill the void my brother
Habits old, tryna find that something new
Never still in the arms of a lover
Seeking darkness wherever light may shine through


Along came the morning of another
Blindsided by a sweet surprise


Odetta, don't you know
That you saved this young man's soul?
And he can watch you getting wise
And you go watch him growing old


You always searching for destruction
Now you bear the scars of a path in which you chose
It takes a brave and a stronger kind of woman
To follow where such a broken man can go


Along came the morning of another
Blind sided by your sweet surprise


Odetta, don't you know
That you saved this young man's soul?
He go watch you getting wise
And you go watch him growing old


You got to hold him close
Odetta, don't you ever let him go
Might be a long wild road
Although we may need you then
We need you now more than ever

That you saved this young man's soul?
He go watch you getting wise
And you go watch him growing old

The rap game'll never be the same again

The Dawg is like a overflowin rhyme from mind
Usually mess with shorties whose a 8 or 9
Shorty bump around to the bass-line

Y'all cat's trick it off, I ain't wastin mine

Just keep gettin' ends, buildin with friends, yo

Got the illest part of the recipe
Yo tell your homegirl to stop stressin me 
Undressin me is the part you really like

The cusses you get, they feelin steady rights

Don't take it personal, it's just comedy
My comedy completely turned to tragedy
I sense some of these rappers still be mad at me
Sweatin her because of her anatomy
When I bang you it'll be assault and battery
Don't make me discombobulate your microphone
Talkin trash will only get you freakin head, flown

Get in that ass like karate son

We manage a smile, sometimes we slip it in

And the corn is taller than me
And the dog is tied to a wagon of rain
And the road is wet as the sea

Will carry across the plains

Know I'm just nigga rich

Deep inside, the truth dies
Bought hope, can't get change
Lost my brain, going insane
Self-medicate is how I cope
Leave my body, soul go afloat
On a roll that never ends
Don't know where I should begin
Feeling trapped, no looking back
Head first in that deep end
Living like a rolling stone
When I die, I leave alone
Getting high, I feel low
But we all know life goes on


You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me

So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great


Last night at the concert 
The audience, it flickers 
They’re lighting up like Christmas
Still, that green’s not for me
On corners people cursing
To legalize their burning
But that ain’t no concern of mine
I keep doing me


Don’t wanna get paranoid
Just wanna be making noise
You want a hit, it’s your choice
But please enjoy the show


I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great


I’m not narcissistic
I’m just high off the music
And I don’t wanna miss it
But I wouldn’t stop you
I’m not narcissistic
You light up if you like it
And though I may not like it
You just keep doing you



Keep- keep doing, keep doing me
Keep doing keep doing me
Keep- keep doing, keep doing me
Keep doing, keep doing me


I didn't smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today

Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old
Splashing everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water

On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And you’re a big old wuss
If you don't jump in
The water


Yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old igloo
Drive until the map turns blue


Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water

Oh let her go boys


Yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you want to see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue


You can stay right there
When the daylights gone
Play truth or dare
And it won’t take long
'Fore you and her got nothing on
But water

All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water

Everything you needed and more
You said it, I heard it
Careful what you wish for
Deleted, defeated everything you've ever been
No mercy, it's the way of the fist


Strapped with rage, got no patience for victims
Sick and tired of the whole fucking world


I don't remember asking you about your imperfections
You might win one battle
But know this, I'll win the fucking war!
End of the goddamn road! 
Step to me, step to me motherfucker
Zip your lip, you've run out of time
Step to me, step to me motherfucker

Deserve it, you earned it, got yourself a fucking war
Believe it, you need it, face down on the fucking floor

Want to break your fucking bones
No mercy, you faggot
Should've left it all alone


Strapped with rage, got no patience for victims
Sick and tired of the whole fucking world

Quickened with passion and with pain
We rise to play a greater part

This is the faith from which we start:
Men shall know commonwealth again
From bitter searching of the heart

We loved the easy and the smart

We rise to play a greater part

The lesser loyalties depart
And neither race nor creed remain
From bitter searching of the heart

Not steering by the venal chart
That tricked the mass for private gain
We rise to play a greater part

Reshaping narrow law and art

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling, won't you please see through me?
Because we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
You taught me precious secrets of the truth with holding nothing
You came out in front, well baby I was high then
But now I'm so much better with my words coming together
Listen to the melody because my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
Because you the boy next door and a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember 
Being together
And I was singing this song for you

You know what time it is
Maybe it's the thug in me


By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on
Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
But do it lightly
Cause that excites me to lay the pipe
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin' deep, it's the thug in me
So whatchu sayin' girl?


I like what I'm doing to you

It's just the thug in me

I like what you're doing to me

I like the thug in you



Moan baby when we bone it's on
It's so strong niggas in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin'
Tongue kissin', as I hit it from the back with the bed ringin'
Give me space, as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I grind when they kick the bass
Love fuckin' in tha mo'nin'
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like
Blindfolded, I'm cold do it real nice, that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin' in the chair, when ya lovin' me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, to get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin' you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you


You like me rough, you like me tough
Making love real freaky baby

You like the thug in me

I like it rough, I like it tough
Real hard and smooth

I like the thug in you



Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder
I make the room rumble, in and out long stroke
Hold ya breath now, close your eyes deep throat
Did you like it?.. Oooh I'm excited!
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited
C'mon now, let me see ya shake your rump
Tell me, how long will it take to cum
Havin' fun, do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay
Only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuckin' cash came
I gotcha goin' wild, 'cause I'm lovin' you
Drugged out with this motherfuckin' thug in you



I like what I'm doing to you


It's just the thug in me
I like what you're doing to me

I like the thug in you

I like what I'm doing to you
It's just the thug in me

I like what you're doing to me

It's just the thug in you


I don't wanna talk, I don't want no explanations

I don't got no motherfuckin' explanations, ya know what I'm sayin?

It's the thug in me
Don't be askin' why I'm pullin' your hair

And why I fuck so motherfuckin' thuggish

That thug passion, ya know what I mean?

Bitch, no mercy
What you scared of?

Didn't you come over here to get fucked?
You ain't come over here for me to be

Strokin', and all that bullshit

You came over here to get fucked
Shit, if I ain't fuck you thug style

Bitch you'd leave my house talkin' bout, ""2Pac can't serve me""
Won't have me crossed up in that bullshit, hahaha

Turn over!

Maybe it's the thug in me

Couple of you hoes heard

Couple of you bitches heard What's Ya Phone # and thought y'all could fuck with me in the bedroom

This is just to tell you it ain't happening, it ain't going down

As long as they make ginseng and condoms bitch you out of luck, you're gonna get fucked

My motherfucking explanation

My motherfucking motto

Maybe it's the thug in me

I'm out this bitch

Hey Johnny J on the strength for real on my momma I think we rocked this one harder than MC Lyte

I think we rocked that one harder than Michael Jackson, man fuck that
We up out this bitch
You know how we do it on Death Row

"I was born in the south land
Twenty some odd years ago
I ran away for the first time
When I was three years old

I'm a free born man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every foot of backroad
Every mile of railroad track

Well I got this old guitar
Well I carry it in an old tote sack
Well I hawked it about a hundred times
But I always get it back

I'm a free born man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every foot of backroad

An' you may not like my song

"
In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light


Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man


And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone

So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat

Yeah

They say they do it, like I do it with no mask on

Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose
Well, I’ll stomp ya fucking head til it’s under the surface
Now I need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
Before I put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
These niggas ain't made of the same shit I’m made of
I dump a clip for my man if he need a favour
I let a nigga slide he came back and almost shot me
Then he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
They don’t understand I was raised by the vultures
Kids laughing like hyenas in a crib full of roaches
Call grandmami ""mommy"" cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missing since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playing games with the orphan
They know my pedigree, test me I’mma off ‘em


Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye


That first body drop, we just getting started, death come in threes
AR15, M16, semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade enter flesh it’s an emergency
Your love leak, heart open call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the altar
See, I have an advantage I don’t care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin’ when them casings start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds, now a nigga half crazy
What is that a tear I see forming in ya eye
Why are you so frightened, we’re all gonna die
You can say a prayer when I’m coming like the reaper
Staring through that sight on the top of my heater
Now...


Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye

You know why?
You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be
You need people like me..
You need people like me so you can point your f*cking fingers
And say ""That's the bad guy.""

I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my n*ggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us but ma MAC - 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Straight solider, bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try, n*ggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, than we multiply
See me striking down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherf*cker, living like I wanna
Ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherf*cker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me, n*gga
Zig-zagging through the freeway
Race me, n*gga in a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherf*cker that you ever saw

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away
I'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave, cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo, creeping out the window
Alone, on my own, I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household
I'm out cold, on the streets screaming ""Motherf*ck peace!""
I got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do I do?
Live the THUG LIFE, n*gga stay true
I wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?
Lord forgive me, if you feel me
Cause all my life I was dirt broke with no hope
Little skinny motherf*cker wanting dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid

The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday, but he don't listen
The poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen! I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money but never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy cause he left me?
Wish he would've hugged me too much like him
So my mama don't love me on my own at a early age
I'm getting paid
And I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray? I'm hanging in the back streets
Running with G's and dope friends, will they jack me?
Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose

Tune in to find my peace and solitude
These empty rooms spin, and I embrace the flaws of being human
The black and white... and sometimes the greys that stay for days
The in between times
The meantimes that make this song of life sing
Play, rest, repeat, read exactly what is written on the sheet
""Don't deviate,"" they say
But I will play what's best for me
I'll press the keys and pull the strings
Create a symphony that's mine


And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on


Let go
I let my voice be heard, then listen for the echo
My own reverb is playing
Cause I'm a movement
There's dissonance, sometimes I make mistakes
Oh I'm human after all, I'm not your expectations
But play, rest, repeat, that's what they ask of me
Just stick to this melody and stay between the lines
But I'll play what's best for me
I'll ring the bells and crash the cymbals
My harmonious design


And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on


In my time here, I wanna be revered and remembered
Oh let them say I came, I conquered
So I won't fear and I can't blend in
You can't replace me and you cannot erase me
Cause my song will live on beyond time


And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song

For continuing my numbing love endlessly
For helping you, and myself, not even considering
For beating myself up and over functioning

For ignoring you: my highest voices
For smiling when my strife was all too obvious
For being so disassociated from my body
And not letting go when it would've been the kindest thing

Gone for the weekend
Time for play
So much we’ve learned while riding this fast train
But when bags are packed up, we haven’t sacked, but I will be back real soon

And oh how I’ve yearned for just one more time dear
‘Cause once we are dancing, heat waves enhancing
Going home alone won’t do

Rip down shows for ya
Hit the strip and do gigs on the road for ya
Lord knows I’ll walk a tight rope for ya
Do the crime, then I’ll lie under oath for ya
Do my time on the grind in the cold for ya
Do or die ‘til I lie in a hole for ya
We stay sealed like a kiss to a rose for ya
No amount of bills could appeal what I owe to ya
No frills, no evidence of hoes in ya
Just a rich history of black gold in ya
Nineteen fifties rock and roll in ya
Sixties…threw the soul in ya
Nineteen seventies, Black Power, Huey B, JB and…ahh…
They put the ‘fro on ya
Eighties, well, that really took a toll on ya
The nineties, well, that’s when we lost control of ya
In the era where the money started moldin’ ya
Nowadays everybody think they roll wicha
Nobody paid ‘til the day they get sold on ya
Nobody pay, everybody download on ya
‘Cause when it’s good, everybody wanna grow on ya
But when it’s hood, keep it on the down low on ya
‘Cause when it’s real, everybody got they nose in ya
And I’m just happy I can vibe out and float wicha
Pick a pocket, locked in a loc’ wicha
Stick a socket, throw around notes wicha
Pick a topic, no tellin’ where I go wicha

Well, angel, morning Sivanna
Well, ain't been gone too far
But heading out towards Ponoma
Where you won't be alone


Where there's thrift store manager in a poke camadee
And a gas mask on his arm
And one by one by one
We'll all be gone


We'll all be gone by the fall
We'll all be gone by the falling light


Brick layer
With a hat down on his feet
I'll say no more
I won't lead no Calvary


How long
Will you disregard the heat?
Half beat
It's no misnomer though


I've the feeling that I better go
So

If you ever go to Houston
Better walk right
Keep your hands in your pockets
And your gun-belt tight
You'll be asking for trouble
If you're looking for a fight
If you ever go to Houston
Boy, you better walk right


If you're ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar
You better watch out for
The man with the shining star
Better know where you're going
Or stay where you are
If you're ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar


I know these streets
I've been here before
I nearly got killed here
During the Mexican war
Something always
Keeps me coming back for more
I know these streets

If you ever go to Dallas
Say hello to Mary Anne
Say I'm still pulling on the trigger
Hanging on the best I can
If you see her sister Lucy
Say I'm sorry I'm not there
Tell her other sister Betsy
To pray the sinner's prayer


I got a restless fever
Burning in my brain
Got to keep riding forward
Can't spoil the game
The same way I leave here
Will be the way that I came
Got a restless fever
Burning in my brain


Mr. Policeman
Can you help me find my girl
Last time I saw her
Was at the Magnolia Hotel
If you help me find her
You can be my pal
Mr. Policeman
Can you help me find my girl

Fort Worth or San Antone
Find the bar rooms I got lost in
And send my memories home
Put my tears in a bottle
Screw the top on tight

You better walk right

You hold me down, right on time, love of my life
You showed up, and showed me so wrong, you were right
Alone in this ocean, floating in the moonlight
At home with the notion it’s me, myself, and I


I was the live fast, car crash, Mulholland Drive
Open the flood gates, this love-hate is making me cry
But tears fill the tub with the blood from your wrist that night


If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it’s me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes


I was a love-sick, dumb dick, top off the stock
Came to shove, when you push and locked his keys in his car
I feel like an animal that’s been kicked around too long
An eel who's electric circuitry that’s been wired all wrong


If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it’s me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes


Now where the hell have you
Gone off and flown away to
Some shithole you call home 
Told me I won’t survive
Somehow, I’m scraping by
We’re reduced to ruin
Rubble, rags and bones


If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it’s me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes

Lost the will, to carry on

As the final chapter fades away

We can see, their flesh is rotten
The band plays a hopeful tune
The champagne is poured as they socialize
The look in their eye
Hide in the light


Everything is paid for tonight

So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told them to change
Told them to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watching the
Dead dancing in their graves

As the visible scars, they multiply
Kiss it goodbye
Too stubborn and I'll destroy

Get 'em full of dread when they find out that I’m dead
Body full of meds, mislead by a pill head
Fucking infrared cocked back, ready for the Feds
Triple six, triple six, rockin' an upside-down crucifix
Luminous lunatic, shredding the bodies
Oh no, I'm not new to this
Satanic bitches that fuck for the ritual
Spiritual visuals, fuckboys habitual
Talkin' that shit, you don’t know, bitch, don’t make me get physical
Walking 'round miserable, smoking that medical
Shoot up a bag of dope
Dependent on chemicals
I'm on a pedestal, neck hangin' from a rope
$carecrow the skeletal, fuck is acceptable?
I have no frontal lobe


Bitch, you can never be the 7th Ward Dragon
Fuck NOPD and fuck JPPD, all the white flags flappin'
Ruby da Cherry, what will he do to me? I can't even imagine
Ridin' in a monster truck, AK tucked
47 shots is what the AK pump
I be that lakefront punk with a vacant trunk
Take some when the bass bump
Then I wait for them at the bottom of the pit
You'll be comin' out the fucking bottom of my pit, that's pitbull shit
Red blood drippin' off my fucking pitbull's lips
Triple the digits of six
Six days went by, on the seventh day, I shine
7th Ward diamond minds illuminated by divine signs
Painted by my mind's eye, blankets lyin' on a fine dime

If you wanna feel good
I'm your man


Glorified as the most high, streets respect
16 years deep, got a sweet connect
Turned over a new leaf, no longer beef for rep
Rather burn blunts, see them fat forces relate
Learned from those that lost their estates
Attorney fees and a greedy judge, throw some a break, I'm trying to get it
And live it how the Carnegies did it, divide, conquer
Cross eyes and then launching my business, it's brain power
We bagging up the same hour
Them high decks 747s collapsed them towers - the streets need me
My advice is to breathe easy
Cause for the dough niggas can't leave me - I'm too established
Cars with the trick gadgets
Automatic show stopper, seize the no static
Bases is loaded
Through the deck, I'm in the place of the oldest
Calling the shots, 'til I'm knocked or facing my grosses
Get it right




The green leaf causes sounds of the sirens to seize
It's so simple, psychologically my mind is at peace
It's all mental, philosopical I sound when I speak
Show potential, been doing this since nine in the streets
Don't destruct, how to back hard, the shoulders is up
Holding a dutch, in the mix moving low as a fuck
Cash related, it's digital, don't mask my favorite
When it's critical, no time to act courageous
Guns' bust, mother cries, son's been touched
Homocide, search the hood, trying to sum shit up
The sequel, second half of the lowest lethal
You lose, double life, chair, or the needle
I'm for the peoples, the best been at war with the worst
A few squeeze through, others just dissolve in the dirt
The nod, for chance really ever to shine
So now you know why a nigga grind 




I put aside all my personal probs
Cause misconception can cause it where it hurts you inside
It's no healing, it's hard not to grow feelings
Of some sort of respect, when you coke dealing amongst men
The truth is we all want in by any means
And it seems for that American dream we all fiends
Finagle 'til we stand stable, solidify
Making plans at the grand table, God be with me
Knowing that the Mars is against me
So the stars and them tarot cards are studied intensely, time's ticking
The wise take time to listen, do the knowledge
I speak from a high position, passive or clever
Here since Jurassic era
Absorb cues from a school that'll last forever
My desire, to bake stack and reach higher
And remain in the game as a empire - we all want it

I zone for the ghetto's 
I am the truth, truth
Every coast gotta know
I'm the most with the flow
No joke I'm a pro
I'm like the pope on the low


Certified murder ties
Been in beef, burglarize
Been a beast, purchased pies
Held heat, perfect size
Felt defeat, felt the rise
Seldom sleep, dealt with lies
Been Tel-Aviv through certain rides
Smelt police, I’m worse when high


Hood legend, household name
Presence is felt, real niggas vouch for my pain
Ahead of myself, what else is there about this game
The letters is spelt, so know when he drouch the same
Measure my wealth with realness, I know what's good
No mills missed, keep one foot in the hood
I still spit like a lot of niggas wish they would
Can sell shit till I'm stiffed and shipped in wood
Misunderstood, mama's only son she's stressed to get it done
She knows I'm the last one left


I am the truth, truth
On a whole nother level
From the stone to the bezel
To the chrome on the metal
I zone for the ghetto's 
I am the truth, truth
Every coast gotta know
I'm the most with the flow
No joke I'm a pro

"In the streets of New York City
Every man can feel the cold
And I don't want no pity
But I want my story told

And the lights shine down on me
They shine on the little boy
Is this way to make him pay
Being born in a world of joy?

But like me, he don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong

Like me, there's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share

Sometimes a man breaks down
And the good things he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground

Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?

Don't you understand what I'm saying?
We need a god down here
A man to lead us children
Take us from the valley of fear

Make the lights shine down on us
Show us the road to go
Help us survive, make us arrive
Teach us what we need to know

Like me, he don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong

Like me, there's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams

And the good things he is searching for
Are crushed into the ground

Can't you see the wind of change?

Catching small bright streams of light

Shadows in my dreams
They're painting scenes of time with you

Como esta amigo?
For the death of those we don't know
Shall we kneel and say a prayer?
They will never know we care


Shall we keep the fires burning?
Shall we keep the flames alive?
Should we try to remember what is wrong and what is right?


No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears


And if we do forget them
And the sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and sadness
Come to visit us again?


Shall we dance a dance in sunlight?
Shall we drink the wine of peace?
Shall our tears be of joy?
Shall we keep at bay the beast?




Inside the scream is silent
Inside it must remain
No victory and no vanquished
Only horror, only pain

That will teach you to drive flash
And a lorry hit you at full power
Your blood gushing like a shower

Well you might have to sell your car
And your parent's brand new house
You lie awake and lose your sleep
Baby, miracles do not come cheap

Well you can have a brand new nose
Light blue eyes or even hazel
A little ear will be much better

I soaked the label off a Flintstone's Jelly Bean jar
I cleared us off a place on that one little table that you left us
Then I pulled me up a big ole piece of floor


I pulled the head off Elvis
Filled Fred up to his pelvis
Yabba Dabba Doo
The King is gone, and so are you


'Round about ten we all got to talkin'
About Graceland, Bedrock and such
The conversation finally turned to women
But they said they didn't get around too much


Elvis said, ""Find 'em young""
And Fred said, ""Old-fashioned girls are fun""
Yabba Dabba Doo
The King is gone, and so are you


Then later on it finally hit me
That you wouldn't be a-comin' home no more
'Cause this time I know you won't forgive me
Like all of them other times before


Then I broke Elvis's nose
Pourin' the last drop from his toes

Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one

Ooohhh


Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

Ooohhh


Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Ooohhh

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil, which path will he take?
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late

Ooohhh


Seventh son of a seventh son

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman, the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

Staring in the mirror as I
Start to carefully contemplate
Just really how deep is this thing I have for you
It's wearing on my heart
And from the start you know I tried, steadily denied
Friendship turned to love
I know you probably think that I'm so strange -
Stuttering on every word when you look my way, why?
And maybe it's all in my mind
But when we hugged goodbye I had butterflies
I just died, yeah yeah yeah


I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight


Your fingers touched my lips
As I tried to explain maybe why you and I
Should hide from such a love affair
My friends think that I'm so insane
To fight this feeling
But my life's at stake
Your embrace, thoughts won't erase
Every now a minute of the day I wait and hope and pray
That you might stay
And now you're moving oh so closely
Killing me so softly, so softly
I just died


I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms

I regress back to the one that I can't see
There's someone I have never talked about
I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Postal border was makin' me mad
So I get up in my cruiser, broke out of the pad
Rolled to the West Side to check out my boys
Twenty brothers in the park, all bringin' the noise
Stepped out the car, Levi's saggin'
Gold around my neck with my limb-walk laggin'
Walked up on my boys with the old E chillin'
The box with the big beats and my boys started illin'
A hoop game started so I jump in
Had the hoods' toughest team so I just had to win
Diz to the outside, 2Pac up the center
A ten minute game and we were the winners
The boys started smackin', talkin' that slack and
Till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
Tried to say we cheat, because he got beat
Another lightweight sucker that can't handle defeat
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's just a day in the life


Finally I'm on vacation and school is through
So here I am, on Monday mornin' with nothin' to do
Tried to get outta my bed, but I can't move
Ya see I'm stuck to my matress like crazy glue
So there I lay, for half the day just thinkin'
Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
But I was all alone so it wasn't no thing
Got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
Picked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrations
Who could be disturbin' me on my vacation?
Speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
Now I know what Michael meant by leave me alone
So I'm askin' who is it? and the answer shocks me
It was the voice of my homeboy Roc-T
Him and Dizzy had been waitin' for me
Had a show at three and now I'm late as can be
Said I have to take a shower, I'll go ahead and take it
If I leave within the hour, I still might make it
I'm rollin' in a sweatsuit, wasn't tryin' to get cute
Hopped on to the stage and said: ""Sorry that I kept you""
I started rappin', girls started clappin'
Couldn't wait to finish so I could start mackin'
Jumped off stage, picked up the girl for the night
Huh, that's how I'm livin', a day in the life, come on
A day in the life


Stretch white limo hits the colosseum
A crowd full of people sayin: ""I can't wait to see 'em""
Who is in the limo, who are they talkin' about?
Strictly Dope in the house, here to turn the party out
We get out the car and can barely stand
Cause everywhere I look are screamin' fans
Girls on my tip but I really don't sweat 'em
They'll tear my new clothes if your bodyguards'll let 'em
Hit backstage with two minutes to spare
Just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
We hear the introduction, the audience is loud
I stepped out on the stage and then I moved the crowd
Winners all over, we tried to leave the scene
But there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
Pen and paper in my face, I couldn't be mean
So I was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's a day in the life

Kick it, kick it, kick it


Coolin' with my posse at the neighborhood disco
Talkin' to a cutie as I'm sippin' on my cisco
Askin' me to dance but I keep on sayin' ""No""
Hate to dance fast, I only like to do it slow
Dizzy's on the dance floor, funky, funky motion
Girl keeps on sweatin' me with sexual kind of totions
Roc is signin' autographs makin' girlies dizzy
Crowd sweatin' Strictly Dope cause we're gettin' busy
Suckers wanna battle us, we move in silence
Strictly Dope is positive, we're tryin' to stop the violence
Started feel tipsy, I'm lookin' for the door
The Cisco had me dizzy, I stumbled to the floor
And more I try to sit up, the less I seem to get up
My stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit' up
The room begins to spin, I pass out for the night
Just another way of livin' a day in the life, kick it


Knew I was a genius, soon as you seen this
Avoid ho's value, don't have to redeem this
Teenage terror, no room for error
A girl start dissin', and I scare her!
Risin' like inflation on your favorite station
Rap is my forte and my recreation
Girls wanna kiss me, suckers wanna diss me
My mother didn't want me to be, but I'm a emcee
The ladies desire, emcees admire
That's why many hate me and call me liar
Hoods of the hype-tip, girls on the ill-trip

How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm known?
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them

Known for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin' me
And nah, it ain't the drugs, it's the straight thug nigga in me

Ship it to the drug dealers

Got money in my pocket now drivin' in a rocket now

Set sail, ye hearts into the sea of hope

We grudged no pains, we faced distress
Yet a glowing wick kindles fire...

The haven foretold a fortress of ages to come

At the rise of a new dawn, woke the daughter of the sun
Wafted on black wings, vastly soaring boding skies

As we took out the ordained new land
We held our breath as the skies got black
And a storm arose, a swarm of crows

Lo and behold! The black birds branched out
A circle wide in the riven skies
They lined the nemeton of the fulgent hill
And again, and again, and again the presage witnessed

Can't lose hope can't lose track
Reach inside pull out the cold
Cause I get tired and that gets old
I'm not scared my head's on straight
It's right here and I can't wait


Yesterday so far away
Tomorrow so far to go
I can't stay no time for fun
The long road waits
And I’m on the run
I’m on the run


Last in line first to the red
Distant light somewhere ahead
All alone caught in between
The world gets cold and I get mean
The world wakes up the light's so strong
The daylight fades it won't be long
The night gets dark and I get wild
I can't help it that's my style


Yesterday so far away
Tomorrow so far to go
I can't stay no time for fun
The long road waits
And I’m on the run
Yesterday so far away
Tomorrow so far to go
I can't stay no time for fun
The long road waits
And I’m on the run
Yesterday so far away
Tomorrow so far to go
I can't stay no time for fun
The long road waits
And I’m on the run


I’m on the run
I’m on the run

Tend to burn the arrow out of the line
Been inclined to wander

Grinder

Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene that's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere

It came with birth
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game

Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill, I take my leave

"The Wife forgave the Mistress for she only entertained
The pain was gone the instant she cleared her throat to speak her name
Said, ""Both of us must suffer from the same unending ache""

The world was not of interest though her days were never dull
Her bed beneath a crucifix on guests performing miracles
With the Son of God just hanging like a common criminal
When I do wrong I am with God, she thought
When I feel lost I am not at all

So give me Black Light 
So give me Hot Knives 
On a dance floor no one tells time 

Oh, I've made love, yeah, I've been fucked, so what?
I'm a cartoon, you're a full moon, let's stay up

She went to see a Mystic who made medicine from rain
And gave up her existence to feel everything, dream others' dreams
Bid farewell to her family with one ecstatic wave 
Out the window
As the car rolled away
She just vanished into a thick mist of change

So let us rejoice 
In all this Pink Noise 
An oscillation that we can pin point

But it won't replace the heartache I caused you;
It won't take the place of lovin' you, I know
So one cup of coffee, then I'll go




Tell the kids I came last night
And kissed them while they slept;
Make my coffee sweet and warm
Just the way you used to lie in my arms


I brought the money like the lawyer said to do
But it won't replace the 'eartache I caused you;

Lyrics to go 


Goin on and on to the rhythmic variation
Wakin in the morning I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the drum sensation
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on so of course communication
Bogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation
Decaptatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason 
Makin all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over 
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa
Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go


 It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
Lyrics to go It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
 It's like that


I know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin
Would have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin
The mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin
Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly 
Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? 
Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded
Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level 
Don't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble 
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? 
This I dedicate to all the honeys that be bogle-in
Cause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go

Check it out y'all
 It's like that y'all

Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato 
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh 
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
That are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangling my cord with hopes that I’ll stop rockin
Never will that happen only if it is permitted 
Wait... I think somebody shitted 
I guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin
I go for what I know doin a show for human beings
Always try to lead yo never will I follow
Blowin up the spot like Fred did to Rollo
And when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go

"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings

And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung

And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me

""Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink""

""There,"" calls the mariner, ""There comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?""

See... onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

Death and she life in death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
Then... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... she, life in death
She lets him live, her chosen one

""One after one by the star dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men

With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one.""

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on

Bobby threw a party
When his parents left town
He told a few people who told a few people
And word got around
It was a legendary evenin'
The whole place got trashed
It took all day Sunday and four of his buddies and twelve Glad bags
They got it all cleaned up, hauled it off in a truck
Before his parents got back
When they got home
He gave them a hug
And almost a heart attack


'Cause there was one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
His daddy threw a fit
And Bobby discovered
There ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer
Like one beer can
One beer can


Bobby had a car
His parents paid for
He'd take it out on dates
And drive it out to the lake
But he don't anymore
Now all of his friends
Are still going out
Not a care in the world
Just thinking about girls
And Bobby sittin' home and thinking about


That one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
That's all it took
You talk about a bummer
Ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer
Like one beer can
One beer can


It could've been worse
But that ain't the point
It could've been a rubber
Or a half-smoked joint
The hardest part is
It was almost fine
They drank a hundred beers
And cleaned up ninety-nine


But there was one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
His daddy had a fit
And Bobby discovered
There ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer
Like one beer can
One beer can

Wherever you are
You know that I adore you
No matter how far
Well, I can go before you
And if ever you need someone
Well, not that you need helping
But if ever you want someone
Know that I am willing


I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind

Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye


Wherever you go
Well, I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
If it's a lot to swallow
And if you just want to be alone
Well, I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go
Well, I'm more than willing

In the way I've been with you
But if love is not for fun
Then it's doomed


'Cause water races
Water races down the waterfalls
Water races
Water races down the waterfall

I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Where there is no danger
Where love has eyes and is not blind

Undercover tactics, leave my enemies dead
Check this, I know you niggas got no love for me
But how the fuck your whole clique turn to thugs, homie?
Like misdemeanors, it's a small thang
You niggas ain't ready for war, let my balls hang
Bust it, I took apart your whole crew, lack heart, I ain't concerned
I bust at Bad Boy, Mobb Deep and murder The Firm
When you scream ""Fake thugs,"" who the fuck you mean?
Get more cream than all of y'all, nigga, fuck your team

Listen Doo-Wop, don't get your shit knocked, you can't win
Tell 'em all to let the games begin, we havin' war games

 Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my A-K, I'm still the thug that you love to hate 








First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Little Ceasar go ask you homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces
Now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
So let the Westside ride the night

 This that kush right here...this that sour...its serious...


I'm reinvented weed scented
Coup exceeding the speed limit smoke easing through the roof
Few regrets breathe through the youth
I'm a seasoned vet I need no excuse baby
Still rubble flights on that Delta shuttle
Patron's in me so the shots is doubled no envy
A few pennies polished persona
Jews defend me it wasn't me honest your honor
I'm a loose cannon though the truth is
I'm used to handling standing tall strong like wall paneling
All from Maryland spreaded my chips
To them stores on Madison my fetish for chicks but umm

Still got the vibe guess I got to be live
Gear so illy gotta stay fly
Appear so willy hunnies got to say hi
But wave by cause I'm gone in the wind
Errol Flynn blue Pradas pearl Benz few dollars girlfriend you holla
My focus on never so often you could catch me with some loafers on
I'm livin its all vision cautious decisions
From the cost to the Porsche with the ribbons
My ambitions embedded deep down in my soul
I don't fold I'm forever like diamonds and gold a smoke's scroll
Bottles and buckles of ice I'm on the mic and ya'll thought little Weezy was nice
Get a load of a lyricist duckin his mows
Street influences doin this since 12 years old but oh...




So I'm back ya'll
Back from black ball
Back with the mask off
Could rap my ass off
Past paused then ducked the task force
Tough as the asphalt
Stuffed the cash vault its my fault
Cause I seen it coming I guess I couldn't see me running still stunning
Name still the same in humming since a younging
Been feeding through illegal funding call it cunning
Done with my days of dumming I'm grown up
Calisthenics in the gym on the daily I'm toned up
And ya'll cowards gon respect my work my word

It feels like I'm getting whipped in the back, with words

I had to feed myself, I had to feed my family
But you know what?

Lord forgive me for my sins
Forgive me for the crazy shit I wish I never did
I'm simply just a young hood girl tryna win
I just want it all, and I gon' pretend
Like I ain't never had to suck a dick to pay my rent
I'm tryna get my family out the hood and new cribs
I wanna finish paying my mothers new whip
I do it for a cause, so understand the kid
I want my little girl to go to school in Fort Lee
Schools in the hood, got him crazy, man he three
And it's fucked that it ain't how it's supposed to be
He should be counting 123's and ABC's
And momma used to beat my ass like every week
That's because she can't have nothing but love for me
I wanna spoil her so much, oh lord please
That's my everything
My everything, my family


You know what?
Even when I was stripping, like bitches was worried 'bout the wrong things
Oh they want red bottoms, they want the biggest cars
Like I'm worried 'bout my father stop cab driving
Before he turn sixty, and my mom stop being a cashier before she fifty like
That's why I'm working so hard out here
That's why I go so hard
Not for me, but for them though
You feel me?


Note to self, for my sister Hennessy
Try and go to school, finish up and get degrees
Don't be fucking trick niggas, just so you can eat
That's the shit I did and it really makes me weak
I would close my eyes, dying for it to be over
The thought of a stranger inside, I just can't be sober
Dirty ass breath, breathing all over my shoulders
Ain't no bitch gon' tell you that, just respect the soldier
And I wanna tell my dad, you don't gotta cab
Drive for two whole weeks just to make a stack
You don't gotta drive no more, I'm gon' change all that
I put that on my everything, I'm gon' pray for that


You know when I was a little girl I used to tell my mom
""Hey mom, when I grow up, I'm gonna buy you a house, I'm gonna buy you a car""

So, it's just like, now that I'm in this position I'm gonna
I'm gonna take full advantage of it

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground


Smoke on the water

Smoke on the water


They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race


Smoke on the water

Smoke on the water




We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know I know we'll never forget


Smoke on the water

Don't start with the ugly part
Don't end with the things that'll make them want to walk away
Tune in at the din again, another price ain't cheap
But somebody's gonna have to pay

Oh yes, you can only guess what it is, what it was
Don't remember what I had in mind
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block
Half-cocked nearly half the time

Give it back, give it back
Give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it


One time for the words divine
And two times for the things that you hope you never have to say
Three scenes in a dead man's dream, and the girls tell the boys
That they better fucking run away

Live it up or g-g-give it up, turn it up, tune it out
Let it rhyme with the other line
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block
Half-cocked nearly all the time

Give it back, give it back
Give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it

The hustle continues
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
Put your mind to, something you want
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is

I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin', pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that


Gettin' money is

Candy low slider, I'm a soul survivor
Keep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck 'bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck 'bout how you feel


Gettin' money is

Gettin' money is

I'm the best still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James
Got a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne
The Louis store, I drop bands, the Gucci store, I drop bands
Prada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a Lam'
Your girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me
Hell naw, I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy
And when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches
$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags
Bitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

Gettin' money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' breakups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See, ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

Pour a drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Couple more and I won't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like this


I’m sorry I named the album ‘Montevallo’
And I’m sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I’m sorry you can’t listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham

I know you want your privacy
And you’ve got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
With these songs you gave to me

'Member the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMAs with me
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk, barely holdin' on, on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me


Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around


A year ago, I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever okay to lie
'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night, you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone, singin' these songs are just something to do
The only dream I ever had was you
I hope you know I'm still in love, it's the kind you can't fall out of


Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around


I know this might seem like a contradiction
And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number, and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen


Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do

But I know there ain't no way, know there ain't no way
Know there ain't no way we're through

Out of feathers, out of bones
We set fire to our homes
Walking barefoot in the snow

Distant rhythm of the drum
As we drifted towards the storm
Baby lion lost his teeth
Now they're swimming in the sea

Where they laid to rest
The birds all left, my tall friend
As your body hit the sand

Million stars up in the sky
Formed a tiger's eye
That looked down on my face

Keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding


Oh but the farrow know
Her hungry eyes, her ancient soul
It's carried by the sneering menagerie

Know what it is to grow
Beneath her sky, her punishing cold
To slowly learn of her ancient misery

To be twisted by something
A shame without a sin
Like how she twisted the bog man
After she married him


Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding


But in all the world
There is one lover worthy of her
With as many souls claimed as she

But for all he's worth
He still shatters always on her earth
The cause of every tear she'd ever weep

Rushing to shore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness


Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Along deserted avenues, steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready, prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line


Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel


Dogs whine in the alleys, smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell, a cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow


Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel


Amidst the upturned burned-out cars, the challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars with which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest the rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests have finished many lives




Now facing one another, the standoff eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls as the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers with shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless, impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory and the seeds of death he's sown


Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel

We'll be placin' memories in frames
Invitin' people 'round to stay
And always owning up to things, to things

The people you choose and where you're from
If so, I've been so lucky, so far, it's outrageous

Since I dealt with all the pain

Believe to be conceived through soulless greed
Never free, trapped, been to hell and back
Been jail, been bailed, still well intact
Harpels, been in Gucci, Chanel in Saks
The car rails or the cartel, tell 'em that


Real nigga season has begun
For all my real niggas
I rep for you, I rap for you, I ride for you
Ghetto to ghetto, city to city
Hood to hood, I salute.. my niggas

The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all, oh


I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow


The apples of the valley hold
The seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh


Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow


The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow 
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back


At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!
Ahhhhh

Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now

I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C
Fanatic
I rep Christ till I D-I-E
Fanatic
I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith
To serve a God whose extremely great
I'm a Fanatic


The world's trying to tidy up, exfoliate they skin
But only Christ can come and ex-foliate they sin
And they fate look grim, if they don't take Him
As the High Priest He is to mediate they sin
The world got too many gods, man we choose the One
From Hebrews, He rules, He bruised His Son
He moves the sun
So if we praying and our schools call us fools
Cause our God's too true to shun
Channels two and one, man it looks insane
TV make a lot Christians seem dramatically strange
Though we may be looked upon as, one and the same
We will not turn in shame, we proclaim the name
Christ Jesus, believe us, you ain't gotta recieve us
But we gon follow our God, wherever the Bible lead us
And you can call us dramatic, fanatic, emphatic
But hey while you at it, take a look at our mathematics


What can I do to make it simple, make it plain
Christ came, emptied Himself and let our sin hang Him
You couldn't blame Him for any sin
While they singing many men
The crucifixion was pretty grim
But when we state the fact that God resurrects
We get funny looks from a world that doesn't get
That we are not David Koresh or Krishna
Or the people on TV who glorifying the bishop
From Edwards to Piper, MacArthur to Spurgeon
From Dallas to France, from Cali to Berlin
There's Christians all over who getting the word in
We ain't crazy we just understand the truth and we burdened
The world sees us Evangelical Christians
As narrow-minded fanatics with a mythical mission
Labeled extremists for sharing our faith
But thats cool, we can carry the weight, of persecution
Cause earth is losing
And if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God's using
So keep it moving
Cause if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God's using


They thought Jesus was out of His mind
They laughed and mocked Him
Called him a cult leader and they tried to stop Him
Pharisees said Christ got His power from Satan
Hating on the very One that came to save em
Even after He rose man the world ain't changed
They still rejecting the name, still look at us strange
Still tell us without shame that our faith's insane
And, it don't take all that to be a Christian mayne
And its hard when you tryin to reach your family and stuff
They say, man you too spiritual, you doing too much
So we show em the love of Christ and live in the light
So they can glorify our God when they look at our life
And we win, for sharing the truth and hearts get changed
We win, if we're rejected because of His name
We win, if seeds get planted and watered to grow
But even if we lost we still be fanatical though

It was the thirty-first gathering of the
Thompsons, Joneses, and Smiths
There were tables full of chicken
Taters, collard greens, and grits
Well it all took place at Hatie Lake State Park
Volleyball, fishin', badmitton, yard darts
Aunt Irene said she'd never seen a turnout like this


Well it started with hand shakes
And lordy, how the babies have grown
As the sun got hotter the day got to draggin' along
I saw Uncle Gene comin' back from his car
With somethin' clear as water in a mason jar
The lemonade got hearty and, Lordy, the party was on


That ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their hiney includin' me
Lord I'd never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree


Well cousin Johnny was a gator
Jimmy was a UT fan
And that football talk
Was quickly gettin out of hand
Granny told Uncle Dave that she hated his guts
Got right up in his face said, your whole famn damily's nuts
Chicken legs got to flyin'
And the whoop started hittin' the fan

Said, listen here folks, it's gone a little too far
Tear it all down, pack it all up
Call it quits while there's still a little love

 no, no, no

Ready 

I'm gonna talk talk talk just as fast as I can do it
And then nobody can copycat until we've gotten through it
And it doesn't really matter whether anything makes sense
You can ask the alligators who are sleeping on the fence
So you might as well give up though it's 
 remember what I said

African-American with the power, just tapped in to the cultural gin
That be swallowin our minds, whole, but yo bust it
Empty ass rappers get me fueled and disgusted
Can't even kick a rhyme about yourself properly
Listen man I'll show you why you ain't toppin me
Epitomy of levelheadedness
Whose concern is how ill I come off and how that ill that I dress
I don't, hit you with a whole bunch of bullshit
On the microphone I keep my prose fluid
Speakin to them people in a Tongue that's Native
Not with an ego that's anti-creative
Conscious to the fact that I'm a talented lad
Make your move at a jam and feel better when sad
Hey, ""Assalamu Alaikum"" to them firm true believers
Hope yall pretty good as the message reciever
Cause yo we got to take things in-to our own hands
And be aware of these dangerous, plentiful lands
That we exist within and combat and shake on
But do it over Tribe because Tribe is the bomb
We get through, especially if you got my back
The Abstract use machete cuttin down on slab
And we do it like this, rarely do we miss
Catch you in the chest with an eagle claw fist
And back you, get it two by four and she'll lack you
Tip you only find a nigga now that out raps you
Or gets at you, and insists that you do it
Cause you make it smooth and you make it like fluid

You luke warm, my shit hotter than Cajuns
Stop, you ain't even worth my while
Mama boy tryin to play it like he motherless child

They play enough times then I just might believe you

I was puttin shit together phatter than 10 Shirley Murdock's
Ain't nuthin but a buncha, thorns in my side like you was acupuncture
Bust it, playin post with me? that's unruly
No matter how bougie you'll still be a moolie

Having bullshit rappers going ""Woe is me""


We demonstrate MCing and music
Laced with the raw P-funk you must choose it
We Buck Rogers, aiyyo we sun you like Twiggie

Mastering the mic like Jordan with the pill
Showing a nigga love cause a nigga got skills
A little sumthin sumthin, corny cats must flee

Was young still, scoobed on the skill, the silver plastic

Mastered, it bugs me to see all the theatrics
Crafted, set career goals recent surpassed it
Streets reps, left in the stress sleeping in caskets
It's backwards, had to untwist it, uplift it, it helps to grip it

This how I live my life, what I did
Lover the hybrid, eye low on my eyelids
 these freaks are  they fuck with voodoo
My niggas do you as deep, leave a meat cleaver through you
Police'll pursue you, you sleep the system'll beat you brutal
Meet the guru, I've been through it, I speak the truthful
My feets are useful, I'm lying hard and my cons the target
But understand that certain niggas they shine regardless
Fine a marker, my nip milk it then keep it moving
Keep recruiting this evolution, peace to students


Keep your eyes open, I'm coming

Sai, ma da sola non sarai
C'è il mio angelo custode che, veglia sempre su di te

So what if I want her to bleed?
What if she needed to see?

She'll never be where I stand


Do you know what you've done to me?
And do you know what it's like to break me down?
Do you know what you've done to me?

Looking for familiar faces
In an empty window pane
Listening for the secret
Searching for the sound
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds
Willow sky, whoa
I walk and wonder why
They say love your brother
But you will catch it when you try
Roll you down the line, boy
Drop you for a loss
Ride you out on a cold railroad And nail you to a cross
November and more
As I wait for the score
They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door
A slow winter day, a night like forever
Sink like a stone, float like a feather
Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the sawhet owl
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the winds howl


Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of shy and sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me

Wondering why I can't get by with my life
But now I'm free
And I done did some right and wrong but still I seen the light

Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit
They try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it 
Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics
A large heard across my sight, I had to fight to clear it 
Like a runner a couple of summers, I often wondered if it
Really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder
A current was occurring, it was stirring up my hunger
But I couldn't let the **** bury a ***** under 
Used to cry hoping all of this would pass
And then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass
A part of my swag but apparently I won
'Cause I took my shades off and now I'm staring at the sun

I'm seeing the light, I'm seeing the light
Uh, realizin' that it's me in the light

I read about it 
Heard about it , and now I know 



I could did wrong
I seen a lot of people hustle but I left them things alone
I almost lost my friend to the struggle
But I guess that made me strong, made me strong
I seen a whole lot of drama and it taught me how to fight
Taught me how to fight
And I thank God for my mama, she showed me what was right
I coulda been in the dark, but thank God for the light
 I seen the light

I lost all the riches, the diamonds in the mind
It turns out that this was the best thing to ever happen to me
Errors and glitches, what a way to find
That such hurt can bring you a greater peace of mind


Oooohh, bring me peace of mind
Ohh-ooo, bring me peace of mind


If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue

Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself

Swipping and swapping the foreigns 
You niggas cannot ignore it
I’m swippin’ and swappin’ the foreigns
Swipping and swapping the foreigns 


I’m swipping and swapping the foreigns
Might go to church in some Jordans
I might go buy me a chopper
Then I’mma buy me a lawyer
I got a check from the barn
I got a neck full of bone
I got a neck full of Bentley
Maserati on my arm
I get that bread in the morning
Somebody pass the croissants
Somebody pass me a lighter
Somebody pass me a joint
I’m using my rap for intimidation
Using my gat for a demonstration
If my car ever got impounded
It would be locked up for illegal immigration
That’s a small thing to a Godzilla
Got me more bars than a bartender
I met a car dealer, my car came with wine
And yours came with some malt liquor
Swipping and swapping the pack suit
I wish I had me some ack
The bitch that I’m with is foreign
On our first day I had took her to sex




Swipping and swapping the foreigns
Balenciaga performer
I think it’s time for war
I might go battle in my armor
And if I kill you, it’s karma
I will not tolerate shit
The youngin be thugging his own 
Advise you not to get hit
I do this shit for my momma
I been in this shit since pajamas
These niggas don’t mean me no harm
You come any closer you’re gonna need arms
I promise, because niggas ain’t seeing me really
I ride the choppa to Denis
And they say the choppa be kissing
Don’t play, you’ll be left with the hickies
I beat up the bully
Hopped in the bed with a witch
Switch up on all of you niggas
My bitch is foreign
She always touring, she bored
Might have to switch up the foreign on bitches
Fucking with Chainz
Might gonna see me on tour-ling, nigga
He put them forgies on everythang
Even the spinner, goddamn!

You say your heart's been broken
And you just can't win
You say that you'll never love again
Let me tell you friend
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
'Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on loveLooked out my window and what did I see
It's another broken family
The kids are stayin' with mama at home
Daddy's livin' in a house all alone


You can't give up on love

'Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold

So many lovers take the easy way
But don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
'Cause every day can't be a honeymoon

Called you up about an hour ago
No one answered guess you weren't home
Since you left I've had a lot of time to think
Been a month of Mondays since I took a drink
Poured what I had stashed down the kitchen sink
Bein angry it ain't no way to live
Takin more than I'll ever give
I only wish this pain would go away


Cause home is where the hurt is
Still tryin to find myself
Stuck here in the middle of lonesome
Wishin I was somewhere else
And this achin heart wasn't filled with bitterness
So alone
Cause home is where the hurt is


Silence he ain't a stranger now
I've come to know him well somehow
Too often dreams echo with the shadows
All I know is I need a friend
Waitin on the bitter end
Bein angry ain't no way to be
Can you believe what's become of me
And all I want is to feel your skin again


Cause home is where the hurt is
Still tryin to find myself
Stuck here in the middle of lonesome
Wishin I was somewhere else
And this achin heart wasn't filled with bitterness
So alone
Cause home is where the hurt is

Talking about the money that I ain't made
Singing o boy don't you lie on the
Track a lack a


O boy don't you lie onthe track

O boy don't you lie on the track

Stand on the rock that Moses stood
Singing o boy don't you lie on the track a lack a


O boy don't you lie onthe track
O boy don't you lie on the track a lack a

Drank so much hooch
It made my eyes be getting blurry
They say I nailed her to the wall
A stich in time don't mean a thing
No hangman jury could make me crawl
Cause I'm a poor boy


O boy don't you lie onthe track
O boy don't you lie on the track a lack a
O boy don't you lie on the track


What you do with the gun that's loaded
Shot her dead when your heart exploded
Tell me baby now d-dontcha worry
Like lyin to the hangman jury
I swear I didn't know that .45 was loaded
In fact my memory ain't too clear
That's not to say she didn't get what she deserved
Least that's the way it look from here
Boy when you lie on the track a lack a
Hey boy don't you lie on the track


Oh a love come tumblin down
Oh a love come tumblin down
Oh 
When a love come tumblin


And every night she take her thing
Into the city and in the mornin' make me beg
Cause If I'd taken all her real titty gritty
I'd smack her right upside the head boy


O boy don't you lie onthe track
O boy don't you lie on the track a lack a
O boy don't you lie on the track


Oh when love come tumblin down

Oh, my love it makes me sad
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did
Everything we had?


Baby, give me one more
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye


Yes, all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye


Yet it seems to make me sad
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did
Everything we had?


Baby, give me one last
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?

Many's the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right

Still, you don't expect to be
Bright and bon vivant
So far away from home, so far away from home


And I don't know a soul who's not been battered
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to its knees
Oh, but it's all right, it's all right
We've lived so well so long
Still, when I think of the road
We're traveling on
I wonder what went wrong
I can't help it, I wonder what went wrong


And I dreamed I was dying
And I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down at me
Smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying
And high up above my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty
Sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying


We come on the ship they call the Mayflower
We come on the ship that sailed the moon
We come in the age's most uncertain hour
And sing an American tune
But it's all right, it's all right, all right

"Long time did I run down like that
I would have three years ago-today but not now
It’s not like that

Could be tomorrow’s song

Run up the hill do as you do
I’m going to chill you know you really ought to do the same
They wanna bug you but I won’t let them today
It’s a sure shot to the bomb drop every single day
You know you swing it and you fling it
And you make some shit up but It’s just 1,2,3 oh

"I've watched you hide the pain too many times
Much too often you don't say what's in your heart
But you don't have to say it's over, I can see it in your eyes
'Cause if tears could talk, you just said goodbye

Without a word, you took our picture from the wall
And your dresses from the closet down the hall
When I tried to talk it over, you just turned away and cried
But if tears could talk, you just said goodbye

And if mirrors spoke they'd tell me I'm a fool
For never loving you the way I wanted to
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died
And if tears could talk, you just said goodbye

And if mirrors spoke they'd tell me I'm a fool
For never loving you the way I wanted to
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died

"Our darling wandered far away while she was out at play
Lost in the woods she couldn't hear a sound
She was our darling girl the sweetest thing in all the world
We searched for her but she couldn't be found

I heard the screams of out little girl far away
Hurry Daddy there's and awful dreadful snake
I ran as fast as I could through the dark and dreary woods
But I reached our darling girl too late

Oh I began to cry I knew that soon she'd have to die
For the snake was warning me close by
I held her close to my face she said daddy kill that snake
It's getting dark tell mommy goodbye

To all parents I must say don't let your children stray away
They need your love to guide them along
Oh God I pray we'll see our darling girl some day
It seems we still can hear her voice around our home

To those now gone astray
Saying ""Come ye men from your load of sin
There at the alter lay""
Many do not heed that the chains of greed
That their conscience never tire
Be assured my friend if you still offend
He will set your fields on fire

Now if you don't from sin retire
He will set your fields on fire
You have heard Jesus' call
And in death your soul must fall
Now my friend if you desire
You may join the heavenly choir
And rejoice with him free from every sin
When He sets this world on fire

You have heard his voice seen His soul rejoice
That trusted in his grace
You have blushed with sin as He knocked within
But still you hide your face
From the blessed Lord and His own true word
But still you say retire
Leave the downward path kindle not His wrath
Or He'll set your fields on fire

The world of lost horizons, the devil's in despair
Are we strong enough to climb up to the sky

Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand

Well, I was born on a farm just south of Jackson
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon

Because you came from out of nowhere

Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there

Crawl across toward your window
I'm calling softly from the street
Always a lonely widow
Half awake and sleeping on my feet
I'm of age but have no children
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Just late night television
Inside my bedroom all alone


There is no use in waiting
Offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings
Etched in the middle of the night
Let me stretch upon your carpet
Let me hear the rain tap on your street
Knowing I am safe on the inside
Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep

As we start trudging
Me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
Vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
Searching for the virgins of life
That be shoving out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
But can I get a level on the bass and on the treble?
Footing up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us 'cause we rarely dig acoustics
Can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting
All over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
So if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
They'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
All over the field, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield


And the musician often tries to capture the new thing so that we might have melody and have rhythm as we do our thing
It's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. Walk tall!


You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching
The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
We are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a Jeep
But dig it in the ground because the footprint now


Walk tall!


If there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
Our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said ""Black is black""
You can come while we Quest, I don't play, I don't jest
Get emotions off your chest, we are Black, we been blessed
Making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
The walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
The times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong

Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope game, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call


""If you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all”
“Brothers and sisters”


It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine
You got fame now you run with no shame
I chose rapping tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go, you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
Cause it's a fall in no time at all

Word, if my homies call


""If you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all”

Well, it's ninety-one and I'm living kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell, pal
But life making records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call

I don't know you from Adam, it could make my day
If you leave me a message I'll give it away
'Cause the most perfect strangers that you can talk to
Are the ones who pretend that you're not really you

Are with any attempts here to play Frankenstein
Come with plenty of chances for changing your mind
When you're building your own creation
Nothing's better than real than a real
Imitation

I won't find it fantastic or think it absurd
When the gun in the first act goes off in the third
'Cause it's rare that you ever know what to expect
From a guy made of corpses with bolts in his neck

If the creature is limping the parts are in place
With a mind of its own and a fist for a face
Say hello to your new creation
Now it's better than real
It's a real imitation

You may wonder what the catch is
As we batten down the hatches

And when later we find that the thing we devised
Has the villagers clamouring for its demise
We will have to admit the futility of
Trying to make something more of this jerry-built love

And you'll notice it bears a resemblance to
Everything I imagined I wanted from you
But at least it's my own creation
And it's better than real
It's a real imitation

When I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again

And a sweet taIking ladies man and you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me, I think I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good, didn't it feel good

Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

Girl, I thought you were the one
But a tundra status motherfucker like me can't be spending up my funds
For a little bit of fun with a dumb honey
Bitch, get off my money
Ain't got no diamonds, but I'm shining like I'm outside
And it's sunny
Now I'm chilling with a bitch on Pluto
Yeah right, motherfucker, like you know
Driving drunk by the lakefront
In my trunk is a bunk-bed, we can go hump
Yeah, girl, we can try judo
Who knows?
Maybe I'll buy you a chain
I know that's why you came to the show
No way it was to blow me on stage
Bitch, get off me, get out of my way
I'mma find me a new hoe
Kudos
Turn up, fuck that, I'm too low
Bitch, come hop in the two door
Getting head from a female Sumo wrestler resting her ass on my dick
Kick 'em to the curb, swerving back to the crib
No one's home, so I jack off thinking about your mom, you motherfucking bitch

Wild beast

Squeeze on them butt cheeks
Slow down on that coke dosage
Hen-Dawg on that nightstand
Hit the coochie
Make it pop
Spread gams, then slam dance
Bobblehead she swallow cock
Until I pop and lock and bust a nut
Eat her up—I'm 69ing
Poke that bitch until I'm Joker smiling
She laser-beaming that bag-a-blow
With a big straw for that powder snow
Obsessed like Stinkmeaner
Rough sex with that sweet diva
Hit the cutty with the meat cleaver
Chop the coochie then eat the beaver
Beat that shit like Liam Neeson
Don't cuff a bitch—I ain't a precinct
On her knees, she yoga queen
Tiger clutch, she hold the D
Puffing nigga and swigging up
Then throwing up in this bitch

I'm Sideways in this shit

"Chi non paga le lasse e' ingiusto
Questo dice la societa'
Ora pero' che son giusto
Sono senza una lira
Ma c'e' stato forse un errore
Si ma c'e' stato forse un errore
Non volevan farmi del male no
Si c'e' stato forse un errore

Il ministro del soldi degli altri
Ora sta' parlando in t.v
Dice che ancora non basta
Bisogna pagare di piu'
C'e' senz'altra un piccolo errore
C'e' senz'altra un piccolo errore
Anche lor lalvolta sbagliano
C'e' senz'altra un piccolo errore

Ma non..... passo piu' ascoltare
Questo drammatico show
Del caro ministro
Devo spegnere la t.v
La mia moglie vuoi mangiare
E su questo vecchia televisore
Devo subito apparecchiare
Neanche il tavolo m'han lascialo

Ero l'ultimo degli artigiani
E nessuno meglio di me
Scolpiva nel legno
L'arte del lavoro che ormai
E' un mestiere che sta' morendo
Il lavoro e' un'arte che sta' morendo
Nella tomba con se' si porta dietro
Oh! anche il futuro del giovani

Del giovani del giovani del giovani del giovani
Del giovani del giovani del giovani del giovani
Del giovani del giovani del giovani del giovani
Del giovani del giovani del giovani del giovani
Del giovani del giovani del giovani del giovani

Ma ora, che la mia mente e' ferma
Perche' creare piu' non potro'
Sento scoppiare in festa
Un vuoto che marire mi fa
Soltanto l'ago mi puo' salvare
Da quella noia che sta uccidendomi
Perche' piu' niente si fa con arte
Anche l'amore si fa in serie, armai

Perche' il nostro capo di stato
A noi italiani lui non da'
Un po' di fiducia
""miei cari italiani"" direi
""voi non siete piu' obbligati
A pagare le vostre tasse
Pagherete soltanto quello che
Voi pensate sia giusto darci""

""Ma state attenti che il nostro paese
Senza il vostro aiuto non puo'
Andare avanti""
Questo agli italiani direi
E sono certo che gill italiani
Diventerebbero piu' compatti
E quella sventola della lira
In poco tempo fra le monete
Diventerebbero lei la regina

La regina la regina la regina la regina
La regina la regina la regina la regina
La regina la regina la regina la regina

It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried up on some line

That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And keeps you ever gentle on my mind


It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit, together walking

It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find

That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind


Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and you were gone

I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind

But not to where I cannot see
You walking on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind


You dip your cup of soup, back from a gurgling
Crackling caldron, in some train yard
Your beard a roughening coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across your face

Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find

That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind

I am not afraid anymore
Standing in the eye of the storm
Ready to face this, dying to taste this, sick sweet warmth
I am not afraid anymore
I want what you got in store
I'm ready to feed now, get in your seat now


And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no


No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no


I am not ashamed anymore
I want something so impure
You better impress now, watching my dress now fall to the floor
Crawling underneath my skin, sweet talk with a hint of sin
Begging you to take me
Devil underneath your grin, sweet thing, but she play to win, heaven gonna hate me

And two big speakers blasting Johnny B. Goode

Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle

She wears snakeskin boots made by Calvin Klein
And cheap sunglasses from the five and dime
All the other girls in school they give her dirty looks
She got an ""A"" in math and never cracked a book
Sure looks good in her denim and pearls

Get a little wild on Saturday night
But make sure she's home before the morning light

I'm going away for a while
Don't care how many miles
It takes it get wherever I go
As long as I can take it slow
And take my time
Finding a brand new heart
Making a breand new start
Been watching the whole world
Fall apart and the pieces
Keep on breaking, so


If I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile


I'll be kicked back in the shade
Nothing but buzz in my veins
Nobody knowing my name
I'm just a face and a place
A dot on the map
And it's too short of a life
I gotta enjoy the ride
I finally get to feeling alive
I'm taking off, I'm flying


If I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile


And just outside this bar
There's a shop with a postcard
I'll write your name
""Wish You Were Here""
And I'll be back when things are clearer

Or the house at the lake with the Benz

As I drive from the city with the money that I earned
Into the dark of a starless sky
I'm staring into nothing and I'm asking you why:
Lord, will you make her a star?
So the world can see who you really are

Little girl, you're old enough to understand
That you'll always be a stranger in a strange, strange land
The men are gonna come while you're fast asleep
So you better just stay close and hold on to me
If my little mocking bird don't sing
Then daddy won't buy her no diamond ring

Dear God, would you send me a child?
Oh God, would you send me a child?
'Cause I wanna put it up on the TV screen
So the world can see what your true word means
Lord, would you just send me a sign?
'Cause I just gotta know if I'm wasting my time!

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Now the war is won
How come nothing tastes good?

You're such a sensitive child!
Oh, you're such a sensitive child!
I know you're tired but it's alright
I just need you to sing for me tonight
You're gonna have your day in the sun;
You know God loves the sensitive ones

Oh! My little bird in a cage!
Oh! My little bird in a cage!
I need you to get up for me, up on that stage
And show the men that you're old for your age
Now ain't the time for fear
But if you don't take it, it will disappear

Oh! My little mockingbird sing!
Oh! My little mockingbird sing!
I need you to get up on that stage for me, honey
And show the men it's not about the money

Wanna hold a mirror up to the world
So that they can see themselves inside my little girl

Do you know where I was at your age?
Any idea where I was at your age?
I was working downtown for the minimum wage
And I'm not gonna let you just throw it all away
I'm through being cute, I'm through being nice
Oh tell me, Lord, am I the Antichrist?!

Sometimes you think you'll be fine by yourself
'Cause a dream is a wish that you make all alone
It's easy to feel like you don't need help
But it's harder to walk on your own
You'll change inside when you realize


The world comes to life
And everything's right from beginning to end
When you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find
The beauty you are when you open your heart
And believe in the gift of a friend
The gift of a friend


Someone who knows when you're lost and you're scared
There through the highs and the lows
Someone to count on
Someone who cares
Beside you wherever you'll go
You'll change inside when you realize


The world comes to life
And everything's right from beginning to end
When you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find
The beauty you are when you open your heart
And believe in the gift of a friend


And when your hope crashes down
Shattering to the ground
You, you feel all alone
When you don't know which way to go
And there's no signs leading you home
You're not alone


The world comes to life
And everything's bright from beginning to end
When you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find

What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do and I run right back to you
You cross the line and it's time to say ""F"" you

What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck, with you, and that's that


'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine 


Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go

When it don't work out for the better

Got it on right here for you baby, take it from me
 Keep doing this, man
We could do that little bit ya like
You know the one that keeps us up all night
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
 Amusing me, huh? Okay

Look, I just landed, your request is granted
I'm in some 2-seater, pumping the best of Janet
Be through in a minute or two, I'm wit the fellas
Bullshiting, trying to finish my brew
But I'm here, it's nice weather, short-sleeve
Ice weather, had on the maddens but the nikes was better
Hope you relax and tonight's whatever
Fatal attraction,the life of pleasure
Got bottles of the L-I-Q, champagne a little 'gnac
You can tell I knew, talk to me
The house or the 'telly suite, I need to know
The perception on my celly's weak, batteries low



If tonight's the, night then let me know

Got it on right here for you baby take it from me
 Keep on doing this shit, wordup

 Gotta give all this up, man
You know the one that keeps us up all night
 Crazy
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me

Listen, I need a diva that could roll cheeba
Blow in and out of town on her own leisure
Love shopping, kalhua's when she club hopping
Pretty toes, love the pose when the thug's watching
Play fair, hair done, face clear
Type of chick any playa wanna take care, she that nice
The truth is that I've been trapped twice
Told her my life, need a wife for me to act right
Or could it be, just me on a ho spree
Nowadays, live alone and I'm lonely, spreading my wings
A player in prokeds and some jeans, a pioneer
And gettin' slow head is my thing
I'm in the mix, wit the lies come along wit the tricks
Improvise, pretty thighs come along wit the hips
I can't knock it, try it but I can't stop it
It's in my blood, like the same way I love chocolate
And all I hear is



If tonight's the, night then let me know
 Whoa
Hit me up as soon as possible
 It's on now
Got it on right here for you baby, take it from me
 Gotta get away man, gotta leave this alone man
We could do that little bit ya like
 Can't keep living like this
You know the one that keeps us up all night
 Just one shortie, one, one
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
 That's all I need one, wordup

I'm in my prime wit a lot on my plate, the party life
Clear my mind when I'm out of the states
Feeling relieved, revived when I'm feeling the breeze
I'm at my best when I'm chilling and I'm feeling at ease
Ladies respect
It's hard when I'm backwards balling, playing the field
And a whole lotta ass be calling, nothing is real
Is it wrong 'cuz I'm doing my thing?, pimping if, either or
But I do what you dream
Follow the leader, I've seen what I needed to see
Leave it to me, and believe I'm not easy to g
Don't even try it, so ladies, all together, let's sing it
I know your needs and your wants
And if you want me to bring it, I gotta hear it



If tonight's the, night then let me know
 Okay
Hit me up as soon as possible
 I'mma figure this all out
Got it on for you right here baby, take it from me
 I don't if I'm getting used
We could do that little bit ya like
 Or if I'm using them, I'mma figure this all out though
You know the one that keeps us up all night
 I'm getting ready to go thru though
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
 Try that, you'll find out where you at


Hold up
Yo dun lemme use your cell for a minute, men, my
Mine's dead man
Getting ready to break out, yeah, try that
I'll see y'all tomorrow, man, wordup
Eyo, save some of that too for tomorrow
We outa here, man, we going to Vegas
Our year, tomorrow

Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close

I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone

I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long

Still just a burn, burn, burning man

Find myself in the Joshua Tree

Got the word where your bird live, out in L.I
From this next bitched named Trista sell lye in Bed Stuy
So nigga what now? Got the whole game fucked now
Who you trust now? See you tinted up your truck now
No need to back track, next time know who you blast at
For gettin' Black clapped, got your cousin killed and nap napped
Now the streets know, nuttin' left for us to keep low
Never sleep though, on point don't make a nigga reach low
Up in Brookdale, heard my little man took 12
Jagged hook shells, doctors claim it don't look well
Left his mom stressed, now it's time to bomb the projects
Teflon vest, four pounds could make your palm sweat
Put the word out, so vexed I even curse your bird out
She don't deserve clout, flippin' wit the cotton herb mouth
On Pottemscott, me and Wop, nickel gats cocked
The way we popped up, so shocked, niggas made our backs rock
Broad daylight, y'all hustle fake, and don't play right
Holdin' shit wit broken clips that spit, but don't spray right
Clothes, cars & ice, hard to remember starvin' nights
Niggas startin' fights, narcs in the dark, coke cloggin' pipes
Starvin wifes, used to buy weight at bargain price
Now we scarred for life, clog is desolvin', slowly outta sight
All illin', navigatin' four wheelin'
Alcohol spillin', marinatin' on your killin'
Like a contest losers fall, winner takes all
Judges make calls, kings stand behind the 8 ball

As the misty morning rolls away to die

Up out of there
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now

You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?

Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this

Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?

A toast to the gangsters


Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs


Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit


So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish


I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker


Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted


Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party


Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player


It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids


They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz , tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted


Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Yea right picture that with a kodak
And better yet, go to times square

It's so much
In so little time that needs to be accomplished
For the fact with me on this track is so live
How could this be denied?
It's hater-proof
Like Snoop once said
“This here's protected by ballers with big dicks and 187 skills”
 that's if it's a must you test us

Hustlers 
What it do? 
My life's always on the line, dig?

I'm a soldier, survivor, period

No question mark is needed

You already know what it is
 Allow me...


From them brick tenements to them cinema flicks
So many quick nightcaps, it's hard to remember some chicks
Flashbacks of certain cats in a similar mix
Sit home doodle semis—such sinister shit
Converse with my Old Earth, in any event
Them hot shells ever hit me, just tell my sons gently
Simply, I'm a rider, I provide for the fam
A Da Vinci with the smarts, hard as Semite Sam
Empty I am, but my subconscious so in-tune
Love the nonsense, they harmless
They know I'm immune, I'm a goon
Geared up, properly groomed
Appear square so the unaware can only assume
From the womb to the tomb, it's a bottomless doom
You pop shit outta pocket, I'ma pop ya balloon
Drop maroon, low Mauri's with it, cocked on glory
See, some may know the half but here's the whole story, shorty


Put my life, put my life on the line
Hustling the streets, tryna keep you a dollar
So put my life, put my life on the line
Let's come and love each other, give me some shine
I put my life, put my life on the line
I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme
I put my life, put my life on the line
Put my life


Blood set, Crip set, G-Unit, Dipset
Nas got rich and reached back, I ain't riff yet
With cheques, crack sells, Elmira black tales
So many wires and you wonder why it's packed jails
Pink border pastel, mink sporter, snatched mail
Rap well since Sugar Hill, homie, ask L
It's a life that I learned to enjoy
Higher fire employed, my attire's McCoy
Not a toy, not a tear when they bury the boy
Not a care, no fear; nothing's here to destroy
So don't annoy, I do this for them Chips Ahoy
I probably die for the cause, blood rising through the gauze
It's a underworld hiding in the floor
Hand on the Bible; still lying to the law
I'm still rhyming, I'm surviving on tour
With the war wounds on me, y'all dudes so corny, cowards


Put my life, put my life on the line
Hustling the streets, tryna keep you a dollar
So put my life, put my life on the line
Let's come and love each other, give me some shine
I put my life, put my life on the line
I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme
I put my life, put my life on the line
Put my life


Back from hibernation, high classification
Certified, I survived from the last generation
Verbalized about pies and past situations
The fly guys, and they demise, how they lives was taken
How they cries was deprived, and they sided with Satan
He was sitting with twenty-five, and got fried from the basin
Manipulation, mood swings the minds of men
Have them do things to get out, then they right back in
Once again, heard it said hip hop was dead
Before Bus' shaved his head, cut off his dreads
Before Kim went on a limb, got sent to the Feds
It seems deep but she chose street-cred instead
Just like me, a true G is hard to find without a fee
I still put my life on the line
It's modesty when you reap from a life of crime
And honestly, it's no receipt for that price to shine


Put my life, put my life on the line
Hustling the streets, tryna keep you a dollar
So put my life, put my life on the line
Let's come and love each other, give me some shine
I put my life, put my life on the line
I pull the other block, pull a beautiful rhyme
I put my life, put my life on the line
Put my life

Back on that chain gang, strumming along
Hammering nails so I can sing my song
The Devil done this to me
I drive the spikes down profound
Building the cages that all broke us down
Boy, get back down on your knees


So take these chains from me
We'll break these bastards, there's no masters here
In the end
We'll break these bastards, there's no masters here


A thousand boots down on the ground
Beating a drum under a marching sound
You better fucking believe
They're screaming left right, left right
Fist in the air, you better pick a side
Against the plutocracy


So take these chains from me
We'll break these bastards, there's no masters here

Save the world

Out of pocket and you still dug in

Fell back for a  Tec

Fatass, big tits, and no blouse
And molly to dip in the 
Rolling around
All I gotta pay is 45 for the grammy
Took a grammy and some mo to New York, we was gold
I've been slurring cause that potion got it hard to understand me
When you filled up with that  I DRAM up for your mammy
Word around the town is that I'm hydronic
And you heard the same thing ain't that ironic
That thing there ain't a hit unless I'm on it
And this right here a hit cause I'm on it
Whenver I'm on E, I ride around for that gas
I can't settle, I'm never glad when it's bags of trash
In the ghetto is where I can the  my cash
And blow that spit out and  when  bitches drive past

But Gollum, and the evil one crept up
And slipped away with her

Tell my brothers on the block–better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes

And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise to all my boys
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'

Whatever it takes to live and stand
'Cause nobody else'll give a damn

Moving it - uh, doing it - uh

Doing it, doing it with the whole frame

Quest for the future, 'stead of the fame

M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches


Now I been known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Hang with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggas in penitentiary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for these females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million niggas with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches

I blow you up on the spot, these Glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me
Actin' all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin' Cristal, start thinkin' 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin' my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody


M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

Comin' with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggas nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin' G's
My niggas crosstown got ki's
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches

I'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contribed to strive never laggin'
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

Payin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a Glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these bitches cause they scandalous
Gettin' niggas fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops

While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches

Light of God dimming weak
Nothing's wrong go back to sleep
Lost the will at infancy
Drown them in charity
Lend them comfort for sorrow
Enthusiasm they borrow
I can clean impurity
Wash away with kerosene


Can't offend my modesty
Thank you for defiling me
Language pure as binary
Instruct with dishonesty
In nature there's no tragedy
Bandage them in tapestry
Trade comfort for identity
Drown me in kerosene

"Yeah, you see, some men see things the way they are, and say, why?
I see things that never was and say, why not?
Just wanna be there, you know? y'all realize, I hold this down


East New York, Eighty-two, first Pumas navy blue
First wife Keisha Wilson with love, she was my baby boo
Crazy crew, paying dues, few of us made it through
Front window, Ms. Gladys, that was my favorite view
Hated school, never went, hookie was better spend
Right around the time the god Ra' spoke of dead presidents
Devilish ever since, seeking for hope
Needing some form of nourishment, it's eighty-eight
Skin starting to radiate, hair on my baby-face
Mama bear could see that I'm there, she finally gave me space
Change of pace moving quicker, consuming liquor
Humping upon some chicks pussy trying to undo her zipper
Gucci slippers who can diss us? 40 deuce movie pictures
What other way but poetically can I prove these scriptures?
Drugs sold 'em, cars rode 'em, guns near my scrotum
Got locked, got right out, gave what I owed 'em
Cried when they buried Will, killed 'Po killed Phil
Murdered Donald Jones, shot clip hit Bill
Prince in prison, damn, yeah I'm still living
I can see 'em up in heaven my nigga dance to the rhythm
God, show me another way, give me another day
Open the lane up so I can make these fuckers pay


Now don't be bringing me no flowers when I'm gone
Cause I won't be coming back when I move on
Any love you hold inside, let me see
Cause it won't mean a thing when I leave
I just wanna be there


Loving da game you gave me, loving my name is AZ
Never sold millions, but fuck it I'm here to save the babies
Look how a lady raised me, some would say he crazy
I'm just a nigga from Brooklyn repping the streets that made me
Rapping for quite a while, all around, tighter style
One of the flyest with the brightest smile, try me how?
Save all the accusations, keep all the confrontations
I'm sitting contemplating trying to crack the combination
Move mystique mostly, must that I keep cozy
At times I creeped doly this is what the East showed me
More into music making trying to renew relations
Ducking the dudes that's hating, please don't make me lose my patience
I put it down for y'all my face surrounds Allah
My catalogue consists of a hundred thousand bars
The god, please respect me, ya heard?

So respect a nigga grind and just let a nigga shine

Twice in the mixture took pictures both times
Hold mines from the ever or  or fly nor 
Smoke more high more better, more cheddar

See its one thing for certain, two things for sure
Stand-up dudes stand up 
That's what i do i be standing up
Its the game right here baby
Its the only game left for me to play


Here for me to get it, started out in the civic
Yellow brick road, niggas calling me the wizard
Frontin' with them hoes i have you running through your digits
Stunting on the globe blowing through like a blizzard
Early l-mavas showing love on the bizzet
Doves on the coop whats the proof you can live it
What is it, when you reach a point for you to pivot
What the lives still vivid no my dice niggas dig it
Dirty game playing got the girly chain hangin'
Bit back slurred speak still street slangin'
I'm sayin' what all the hustlin' for
For you to get it, flip it, spend it, then you hustle for more


Ya dig, hold on, imma be around for a long time

Chased dollars but to me whats most important is knowledge
Know the ledge for ya'll niggas that so on the edge

Unknowing my quest until I had reality thrown at my chest
Why would it stress it seem a nigga zone at his best
Is it a test at times I feel my soul is possesed

To go change fake I.D.'s and the code names but no lames
3 op's and theres more to come we all as one
Recognize I been this raw since young




Was I sent for the sinners that never repent
Or just another thug bent trying to pay for his rent
Days in contempt I see how ya'll amazed in suspense
Ways spent catch me at the major events
So blow a herb on ya corner curb my word
Doe or Die I was born a swerve bet that
From 40 bottles to the champagne twist a pop

And pray enough to hope and meet em at the crossroads reunite
Hope I live to see 88 with crazy cake

The damned walked in beside her
And he laid his money down
He said don't try to scream now
But I want this one to hurt
And tonight, my pretty one
I'm gonna get my money's worth
He said they never listen
She said they'd never understand

I swear I didn't want to
And I swear I didn't know
That things like this could happen
To a 17-year old

And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again


In the haze of a smoky room
He chokes that bottle down
It's been a month since her saw her face
Underneath the blood stained gown
He thinks about that little girl
And the one he has at home
And wonders, ""What if that was my little girl
Walking down that road alone?""

And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away

She's a good girl, she's Daddy's favourite
He's saved for Harvard, he knows she'll make it
She's good at school, she's never truant
She can speak French, I think she's fluent


'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that’s what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught them


She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught


She's a good girl, a straight A-student
She's really into all that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say, ""That's where you'll find me""


But if you look then you won’t find her there
She may be clever but she just acts too square
'Cause in the back of the room where nobody looks
She’ll be with her boyfriend
She’s not reading books


She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls


She’s a good girl, hasn’t been caught
She’s a good girl, hasn’t been caught


She said to me, ""Forget what you thought""
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw

Yeah, I don't know
I guess I feel like—when I'm around you—that I'm invisible
It's like you don't even see me
And I'm standing right in front of you, yeah


Yeah, I feel invisible, I knew this wasn't easy
I'm standing right in front of you, but you don't even see me
I pass you in the hallway, but you don't even glance, so
I just kinda walk by like I ain't never passed you
I do my best to pretend that I don't notice you
'Cause you don't ever notice me, so what am I supposed to do?
What, I gotta yell it in order for you to see it?
Got it written on my face, it's pretty easy to read it
But you choose not to, so that's what I'ma have to do
My heart is getting tired; I'm tired of running after you
I try to talk, but you just keep ignoring me
Pretending that you listen—you don't listen; you're destroying me
See, I look up to you, but you keep looking down on me
You never say you love me or you care or that you're proud of me
In other words, you're drowning me
I get on my knees and I pray
Pretty pathetic, but you make it pretty easy to say


I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore


You like a nightmare, every time I'm dreaming
The longest conversation that we had was when we're screaming
""And what you say?"" ""What you say?"" There's nothing else to talk about
Before I even say a word, it's like you're already walking out
You keep making promises, but you don't ever keep 'em
And then look at me stupid when I say I don't believe 'em
Yeah, that's right I don't believe you, and how do you expect me to?
You don't show respect to me, but I should show respect to you?
Gosh, you're such a hypocrite, I doubt you're even listening
Things have got so bad, you don't even pretend you're interested
And every time we hug, which isn't very often
The thing I used to love has now become something that's awkward
You put that smile up on your face, but I can tell you're faking
You look me in the eyes and you tell me I'm amazing
But all your words are wasted, 'cause I swear that you make it up
And I'm so sick of chasing love; I guess my pace ain't quick enough
I hate it, 'cause


I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore


I'm full grown now, moved out, I thought it was best
The sad thing is, I doubt you even noticed I left
I quit calling 'cause you ain't ever answer the phone
So the last time we talked, I told you, “Leave me alone”
I'm supposed to open my arms and hold you now?
Hold you? Wow. You ain't never held me; how—
Do you expect a kid that you never raised to do right—
To break the walls down and make you a part of my life?
But hold up, here comes a call from the hospital
They told me I should come and see you if it's possible
I got my shoes to go, I threw my pride on the floor
Saw a real smile on you when I walked in the door
The doc told me you ain't got more than a day
I just got you and this cancer gon' take you away
You say you love me, you can see me, everything's okay
For some reason, I no longer feel the urge to say


I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore


I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore

No lamore questa sera no, son tropppo stanca e adesso dormiro
Tu leggi pure non disturbi sai
E una parola non ci scappa mai

Se vuoi parlare, ti ascoltero
E chissa quante cose nuove scopriro
Comicio io, cominci tu
Per iniziare a litigare o per non salutarci piu

No lamore questa sera no o domattina non mi svegliero
Casa vuoi dire solo il letto poi...
Se una parola non ci scappa mai

Dove lamore mio, dove

Non e, non e piu qui...

Ce sempre un bacio alla TV
Un bacio in cui non ci si ritrova piu
Un po la noia, un po perche
Nussuno muove il primo passa ma lo lascia sempre a te

No lamore questa sera no sai che i bambini stanno sempre svegli
Ancora un po
Ho un po caldo fatti un po piu in la

Sei come un fiore che non appassisce mai
Si puo salire, andare gui
Ma e un dovere ris vegliarsi e poi amarsi un po di piu

Stiamo abbracciati e chiacchieriamo ancora un po
Riscopriamo che ce un prima e un poi

Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty gritty


Yes sir, no sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can’t catch no dose
Of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer


Home sweet home


Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma she's a cooking
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto


Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It isn't no good when boss man's
Stuffing it down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rocking the street


Home sweet home
Mama, take me home sweet home

I’m just a punk in the street

No matter what I try there’s no room in my mind
No way to go round that, that’s just the way it is must I remind
I don’t pick up the phone but you still try to call
There’s nothing left to say you’ve already gotta know we’ve said it all
The story never ends, in search of something
But once we arrive it all starts again
Reaching for higher ground, the river’s rising
It keeps on flowing forever no matter what we have found


Sometimes it seems insane
To just keep pressing on
As if it will put out the flame
But still the thirst remains
Drink another drink
And somehow I still feel the same


Step off, head out, take flight, and just run
Got five of everything but I just need one
My brain telling me what I want, I need
Got five of everything but I still proceed


Help me fill up this hole
It’s gaping and out of control
It feels like I’m losing touch and it’s taking its toll
When the wall isn’t moving
State of things not improving
And no satisfaction in the distraction of the day




Living in this culture can be a drag
It’s just a commercial what we have
A one track mind we grab, grab, grab
We’re past being crazy, call us mad
Gone is the golden egg and the goose
And the bullshit of all hell breaking loose
We gotta hit the boost
Sip on the thick juice
Disregard the bad cards
And wake the truth

Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides 
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin tec-9
They know they scared to see us sober
Stop drinkin King Cobra, and niggas'll take the world over
It's all up to you 
Blame the Korean, blame the jew, or be a crooked nigga too


I've got to do, what I'm gon' do
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?
I'm gon' do, what I do
I'm gon' say, what I say
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?


Aiyyo! Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin up precincts and OOOH
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too


I've got to do, what I'm gon' do
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?
I'm gon' do, what I do

You didn't tell me you love me until I said I loved you
But I didn't love you until after I fucked you
Are we both guilty? Do you feel me?
I was tryna go half and half with you on a baby
I must've been crazy to let you play me
Bitch, I'm too wavy, you can never replace me
And I can't take it, you was amazing
I would've went half and half with you on a baby


You was the one, I said I loved you so I fucked with you
I was hearing rumors, hoping that they wasn't true
You would call my phone thinking it was cool but you knew
Everything that you told me that you wasn't doing
You do girl, it was true girl
Now I got a couple new girls in my new world
Any different type of mood, I can pick and choose girls
Tell me what you wanna do, I can pick you up
In a two door, that's a new sport, come and hop in
All them niggas talking nonsense, they don't want this
Girl I prolly would've gave you anything you wanted
Girl I prolly would've put a baby in your stomach


Half on a baby, Na Na Nah
Half on a baby, Na-Na Nah-Na
Half on a baby, Na-Na Nah Nah
Nah Na-Na Nah Na
Shawty, me, you, and a baby
Could've been me, you, and a baby
Half on a baby, on a baby
Half on a baby, on a, ha!


I told her the moment that I approached her
Come closer, I needed a little closure
Heart colder, I'm looking over my shoulder
Then I showed her something to make her come over
I put lemons in the jacuzzi, if you see
How I move, we might end up making a movie
Come through, see what I'm talking is really true things
We can do things, girl we can do things
If you wanna do it on the low, we can do it that's cool
But if you fuck it up that's you
I can cut you off in a second if you try to act new
Oh, I'll be throwing up my deuce, yeah


Half on a baby, Na Na Nah
Half on a baby, Na-Na Nah-Na
Half on a baby, Na-Na Nah Nah

Could've been me, you, and a baby
Half on a baby, on a baby

"My name is volatile
I’ve been this way a long while
I’d surely like to rest
But the energy gets the best of me
It’s been a wild ride
I wouldn’t change a minute
I can’t slow down inside
Guess that’s why I live it



The years of mischief
Followed by weeks of thrift
I land on earth’s hard face
No legs could keep that pace
And through the rest I sift

Is there ever a time
When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind

Highly frustrated wanna feel elated
Come Monday morn', you feel checkmated
You can be uncool and become the rule
Exceptions were made to drown

I’m not used to it, you’d think I’d be by now
The ins, the outs, the ups and the downs!

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, Just creatures
It comes and goes and comes and goes
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

I know what you were gonna say
But were afraid to cause dismay
Your lyrics switched around
The mixture watered down
And now a pointless display

It’s something one won’t understand
Unless they're in it with me hand in hand

Don’t buy the fear don’t buy that my dear
The things you love you must keep near and
Carry on and you won’t feel withdrawn
Even if you’re coming down

Sometimes it’s wearable, sometimes it's bearable
I careen towards balance til’ the glass is full

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, just creatures
It comes and goes and comes and goes

Sometimes
Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off
Sometimes just like you

I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off


Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “Tell it to my face”
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly


I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun


I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine


I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly


Your lies were hot kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or an iron from the fire
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar


I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine


I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly

Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

"While digesting Reader's Digest
In the back of the dirty book store
A plastic flag with gum on the back
Fell out on the floor

Well, I picked it up and I went outside
And slapped it on my window shield
And if I could see ol' Betsy Ross
I'd tell her how good I feel

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I went to the bank this morning
And the cashier said to me
""If you join the Christmas club
We'll give you ten of them little flags for free.""

Well, I didn't mess around a bit
I took him up on what he said
And I stuck them stickers all over my car
And one on my wife's forehead

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I got my window shield so filled
With flags I couldn't see
So, I ran the car upside a curb
And right into a tree

By the time they got a doctor down
I was already dead
And I'll never understand why the man
Standing in the Pearly Gates said

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for

Perchè negli occhi aveva avventura!
E quando prese in pugno la fortuna
E un gruzzolo di soldi per caso ereditò

Si fece una grande festa
Da fare girar la testa!
Scoppiarono i mortaretti
Si fecero dei banchetti!
Per tutti ci fu un sorriso,che giorni di paradiso

Per il pastore ricco Serafino!

Voce:regalò qualche cosa agli amici
Che gioia nel paese
Per quelle pazza spese.Uno scialle, una radio, un coltello
E una macchina rossa per se!

Coro:oh Serafino...
Le donne, le donne ti dicono di sì.Beato te!

Tierà, tierà, tierà\""

Che in un burrone vae scoppierà!

Dopo i giorni dell'allegria
Amaro resta il vino...
Si trova in tribunale Serafino!
I suoi nemici per prendere i suoi soldi
Lo fan passar per matto
E lui che fa!
Si riprende le pecore e il cane
Gli amici sempre pronti
E torna là sui monti
Nella casa più grande del mondo
Che soffitto e pareti non ha!

Coro:oh Serafino...
Difendi, difendi la tua libertà!la libertà!

Un uomo con il cuore da bambino!

With the same wordplay that supplied the Qur'an
Any stagnation, I rise beyond
Get it right, understand my ties are strong
From the streets where it all started, back in school
To the dough stackin' nigga started actin' fool
Used to be the loud type love to flash the jewels
Hit somethin' nice then broadcast the news
Bags of weed, used to slow drag the weed
Did it all in the hood, had to leave

Short nigga what up, short to grab the 'vees
Blasted for few winters, rejuvenated
Returnin' like you remembered, but more swifter
Stronger than your malt liquor

So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful

Please don't judge me and I won't judge you

And if you love me, then let it be beautiful


Beautiful
Let it be beautiful
Just let the past, just be the past
Let it be beautiful
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh

Take me as I am and not who I was
Let it be beautiful
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please



So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful 
Please don't judge me  and I won't judge you

Standing in the queue at the Odeon, alright

Bougainvilleas fall into the pool
The hard shelled bugs bite my forearm
My right index fingernail chewed to the quick
My cervix is alarmed, scared even
My sprinklers go off at 6 PM each day
And sometimes they spray unsuspecting visitors
My pimples are gooses all over my legs
My brow is furrowed and my vision is blurred


And how I do love London
And how I do love London


The birds make guttural sounds and protect me
My friends come to visit and love me a lot
I don't have the energy to fill them in
I am lagged by the jet and the 12 hour flight


And how I do love London
And how I do love London


I am intrigued by the boy with the androgynous songs
Sometimes they rhyme sometimes they rhyme not
The steam will smell of eucalyptus in the shower
The hug will feel forced upon you inconsolable thing


And how I do love London
And how I do love London


Deep breaths will not make my brain stand still
To be loved and swallowed or single and depraved
I love speaking French to the taxi drivers
We slept and were cold on the train out of France


And how I do love London

A storm lies beyond the horizon, barely

Like children that can’t stay awake
Stay here untainted and safe...


Stay while the melody’s sung
Break like a wave on the run

That it won’t last forever


Rush, rush
Take me away
Like hourglass sand that never escapes
Stars are born and then die, but carefree
A slow clock that ticks without time
And watched by an ocean of eyes
Ending, ascending and then...

Bitch, im from the H ""till i die""
Я не жадный, но этим людям мне нечего дать
Мне только битвы точат меч, и вода
Забыты начала, а сотни мечт и подавно
Жалко съехавших, у кого мозг и речь не в ладах
Детей надо беречь от огня
Что ж вы пялите ношу вола на плечи ягнят
Какие разговоры тут о вечных годах
Где под вашими окнами, что не вечер - беда?
Чернеет с друзьями встреч календарь
Что воспитывать душу, ведь её легче продать?
Эти тропы давно прочерчены вдаль
Для неразумных юношей и для доверчивых дам


Люди знают: всё плохо
Да и там за забором трава всё того же оттенка
Тут не хвалят болото, ни своё, ни чужое
И не ждут перемен, брат

И так дрочишь на то, сколько ты спускаешь на бельё
Что  спускаешь на бельё, что  спускаешь на бельё
Твои инсигнии - иллюзии, в них не было лоска
Ты не умеешь думать сын, всё твое мнение — докса
Но пытаешь выглядеть тем не менее грозно
Хотя давно для всех открыл к своей Латверии доступ 
Так что когти давно надо рвать, всем уже похуй, что да как
И кто из нас Левиафан
Пока ребята с понтами на гольфах
Я держу курс, веду по льду к их берегам свой Нагльфар
И ты знаешь весь исход, и всё пытаешься втуне
Но даже Борден не смог поймать руками все пули
Ты готов на всю хуйню ради внимания публики
Делаешь всё, что не нужно, хотя знаешь, что будет, ублюдок

Off the show to cover up, it ain't hard to
Soak it all in, I take a picture
In my mind, like a permanent fixture
Beach ball with a picnic table
Paper cups full of platinum labels
Shots, umbrella, blue shade
We came all this way


To see the waves break
Half a mile away babe


While we twist a little lime in a cold Corona
Let that  take the moment over
Wash it away in that sugar sand haze all afternoon
Yeah, hang and chill
Ain't nobody else got this kind of view
Watching the sun kiss you


Every round we sink a little deeper
Red Red Wine playing through the speakers
Lean in and taste the salt from your lips
From the last round margarita sip
Girl, you make me wanna stay out here
Till the sunset disappears
Kind of drunk, just talking 'bout nothing


Baby, maybe when they left stars out
We'll close up but right now

Alright, new drink: one part Alizé, one part Cristal
Thug's passion, baby, y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me, pour a glass and drink with a nigga
You know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols... alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby


Man, I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier that I'll roll up a nigga like it's heaven sent
Trippin' over dead presidents, they got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinkin'
Drinkin' over a felony and hell of me and how it will be in hella shit
People tellin' me to cool out, but they ain't feelin' me
A motherfuckin' fool 'bout my fuckin' cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine, thuggin'
Huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while passin' through times
And all these bastards that be watchin', just keep it plain
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can, pinkle with rain twinklin', diamonds and things go blinkin'
Enough to hold me 'til I'm old and wrinklin'
These adversaries, they gon' have to be worryin'
'Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion
'Til I'm buryin' my thug passion


I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh


Now what if me turn this Hennessy into a robbery?
The prophecy probably suddenly switch how it supposed to be
And dirty money can't be evil 'cause it's fillin' up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twistin' riches, but there's only one way to make more
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
And my bigger bro, couldn't know
But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
With a thug passion


Puttin' down, mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin', I'm askin' what happened
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to?
That's what money and fame do, see, they ain't true
Travelin' this road, my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can be easily stated
It's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion
Left me to fuckin' greatest, load up and take shit


Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split


Creep with me, through that immortal flow 
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row 
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowin' and let that loc see smoke
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow


I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh


They say money don't make the man, but damn, I'm makin' money
Observin' you motherfuckers 'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it, but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me 'bout to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me
She smiles; a nigga's full of passion, satisfaction is everlastin'
""How does it feel?"" What I'm askin' while I'm rubbin' on that ass
""Why you laughin'?""See, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious, baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
It's so physical, my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
Baby, I'm born to ball, thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a potion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion


I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
Thug passion
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh
Thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby

You got me drippin' wet

Oh, oh


I live a lifestyle full of first impressions
I've got my hands full of unhealthy obsessions
She bites my lip, I'm sure to follow
We take a drink to the guilty and the hollow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Sex and white lies
Handcuffs and alibis
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps
Her heart beats, red wine
My toxic valentine
Lays her halo on the pillow that used to be mine
Oh, oh
My toxic valentine
Oh, oh
My toxic valentine


'Cause I'm not the type to forget or to bury my head
Just take off your wings
They could never get you quite as high as I did
And you know it


Sex and white lies
Handcuffs and alibis
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps
Her heart beats, red wine
My toxic valentine
Lays her halo on the pillow that used to be-

Sex and white lies
Handcuffs and alibis
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps
Her heart beats, red wine

Lays her halo on the pillow that used to be-

I'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as I stack my banks up
I'll have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50

Well I ain't never been an angel
I ain't never been called a saint
Yeah, I've decorated every bar in town
With a big red coat of paint

But good thing I had a good raisin'
For all the Hell I've raised since then
When that roll is called up yonder
I know they've gonna let me in


'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
And he ain't letting go, he ain't letting go
The Devil reaches out but he can't grab hold

Might have a little rust on my halo
But when I'm gone I know where I'll go

Than holy water, it's true
More Saturday night on an old bar stool
Than a Sunday morning pew

Everyday it seems we're wasting away 
Another place where the faces are so cold

Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit

And I'm in rare form if I've got Airs on
Niggas know I'm buying Guccis like they fucking Air Jordans

I'm trynna take the 'T' off and make a mill rapping
Codeine, fetti, shorty all white porcelain
Reverse cowgirl, shawty ride a nigga like a horse

It ain't no secret, I'mma get it
I'm over niggas heads like an ATL fitted
I'm over bitches house like I'm only gonna visit
When they try to make me stay I tell them ""That's some strong liquor""
You know what time it is
I'm on the strong and the sizzurp
And since a young nigga, I've been on with the wiz-ord
A nigga play me wrong I put his dome in the diz-irt
I'm going on tour, I'm going be gone till November
Ruthless, ice cubes all on my sizz-erp
Pinky ring huge, such a mofuckin insult
And if you riding dubs, then my rims are much older
Two white cups, and one cup holder
Told ya, grab me a soda
Shake it like a shake-weight

Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day


I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt


West Texas cowboys, they's all around
Weed, liquor and money, they load it down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand




My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be


One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, lord he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico


I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, god rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

So many things unanswered

How could I have changed to make it better?
And would I?

I still feel so much hate inside of me
Seems like you were just waiting for me to fail

Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha


I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up


Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up


Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love

And then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all, it was KutMasta Kurt with a remix


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
When I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter


Ay, yo, one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shaked, and made eye contact
Partied and toasted strong, all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No opportunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up, you weaken your system
And had to throw it up
I brought you back into things
Like imaginary man of your dreams
You'd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt leather, never pleather
Real bringing the pleasure
By any means, it means I'm leaving your team
Hell of a team, man, it seems but I tried so hard


I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

Stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now, chock full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start

2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feeling me, feeling you...
Everything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz


Breaking up with my ex was the hard part
Had to pull the ass out like the gar-bage
Bout to take this new thang to a pinnacle
You feel me, feeling you I ma-ssage your physical
Thank God... I'm spiritual
She ask me what I'm finna do I say get into you
One leg up followed by the other
Get a little head then I find a rubber
We don't talk on the phone - we Tiger text
That mean she send a few flicks and I send a check
You 'memba Shonda, the one that had a Honda
Good head on her, you can learn a lot from her


2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind

Everything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz


In the a.m. I think about her fragrance
When she met me I made her change all her statements
Not what she say... but what she bank
And how she think... I can't complain
On to the next one pro-gression
Keep the past and the present, separate
I got alotta spots like a leopard
One to trap in, one to have sex in
One to stack in, one to get dressed in
I'm getting married Ben Franklin my best man
3 cell phones she got all the numbers
I told her right then it was all or nothing
Yeah I'm on that loud I know you heard of me
Hair-weave killer, emergency
Hair-weave killer, I murder weaves
Hair-weave killer, murder scene

Well, the doctor comes around with his face all bright
And he says in a little while you'll be all right
All he gives is a humbug pill
A dose of dope and a great big bill
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?


Well there once was a time when everything was cheap
But now prices nearly puts a man to sleep
When we get our grocery bill
We just feel like making our will
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?


Prohibition's good if 'tis conducted right
There's no sense in shooting a man 'til he shows flight
Officers kill without a cause
Then they complain about the funny laws
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?



I remember when dry goods were cheap as dirt
We could take two bits and buy a dandy shirt
Now we pay ten bucks or more
Maybe get a shirt that another man wore
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?

Well, I used to trade with a man by the name of Gray
Flour was fifty cents for a twenty-four pound bag
Now it's a dollar and a half beside
Just like a-skinning off a flea for the hide
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?

Oh, the schools we have today ain't worth a cent
But they see to it that every child is sent
If we don't send everyday
We have a heavy fine to pay
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?

Most all preachers preach for gold and not for souls
That's what keeps a poor man always in a hole
We can hardly get our breath
Taxed and schooled and preached to death
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?

Oh, it's time for every man to be awake
We pay fifty cents a pound when we ask for steak
When we get our package home
A little wad of paper with gristle and bone
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?

What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do and I run right back to you
You cross the line and it's time to say ""F"" you

What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck, with you, and that's that


'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine


Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go

Yeah!
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Til they came to take all I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed you home
And like that


Broken down

You hide behind lies

Wrapped up inside your lies

Seems like we never would talk the right way
Every other minute I fought for my place
And drop what I made thought and you might stay so
I'm guessing that you probably know
When your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold
Like a pill I couldn't swallow and it swallowed me whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed me home

Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling, cold towel, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind

I wish I had a penny for, every time she gave me those eyes
Those eyes would cry take me on the floor
I've been with her once or twice, in my dreams it felt so nice
I'd do exactly what those eyes told me
There's never a smile on your face, always a gesture of disgrace
Obviously you're unhappy with my
Stares that I hold far too long of course I know that it is wrong
But deep down inside I know you like it


In my little hide, in my little hide, in my little hide, hide, hide, hide


Upon the rack, I'm stretched and split, demented as I do my bit
Whatever I could do to make you smile
I can't wait to get to bed, not so I can rest my head
It means I can dream about you more


In my little hide, in my little hide, in my little hide, in my little hide
In my little hide, in my little hide, in my little hide, hide, hide, hide

When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on

Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall, and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me


When the meaning is gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me


What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me


Since it all begun
To it's reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me


Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

"Affamati come lupi
Viviamo in crudeltà
E tutto sembra perso
In questa oscurità
All'angolo e indifeso
Ti cerco accanto a me... da soli
Gli occhi non vedono
Ti penso e cambia il mondo
Le voci intorno a me
Cambia il mondo
Vedo oltre quel che c'è
Vivo e affondo
E l'inverno è su di me
Ma so che cambia il mondo
Se al mondo sto con te
C'è una strada in ogni uomo
Un'opportunità
Il cuore è un serbatoio
Di rabbia e di pietà
Credo solo al tuo sorriso
Nel senso che mi dà
Da soli... gli occhi non vedono
Ti penso e cambia il mondo
Le voci intorno a me
Cambia il mondo
Vedo oltre quel che c'è
Vivo e affondo
E l'inverno è su di me
Lo so che cambia il mondo

Io sono qui... ti aspetto qui
Oltre il buio mi vedrai
Saprò difenderti... proteggerti
E non stancarmi mai
Acqua nel deserto... ti troverò
Dormi e si vedrà
Ti sentirai accarezzar
Ti penso e cambia il mondo
Le facce intorno a me
Cambia il mondo
Vedo oltre quel che c'è
Vivo e affondo
E l'inverno è su di me
Ma so che cambia il mondo

Live back at 'cha Westside baaaaby
Aight fuck it, we gone flip some new shit now
You heard ""All Eyez on Me,"" niggas know what time it is
 Pac do it like that 
Rhymin' and stealin', sellin' five million

Fresh out on bail, niggas still can't see me
That's how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin' plan, and a new mission

Some competition, so they say, these niggas is gay if you ask me

Blast me? It could never happen
At least not while I'm walkin' and rappin'
Heard of some niggas on the other side of town who wanna ride wit' me

They can't hide, listen to the rough shit, my clique bring



I done said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears; now
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears


Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead and buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll
Never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life in fuck 'em mode, exposin' tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hell bound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin', my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, grind for cash makin'
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin' tattoo tears


Said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears 
Said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears


Thugged out baby!
Yeah blazed out shedding tattooed tears

This for my nigga Young Noble
Explode on these bitch made niggas


Criminal ways of thinkin', I'm gettin' paid wit' Lincolns
Niggas turn made victims, get my rage from a gauge hittin'
Hittin' ya back, you ain't kickin' no facts
Fakin' jacks, you and ya bitch clique could get this AK
Hold a pound four, you catch a flame from my torch
The game was taught, I want my name in the source
Little nigga, from jumpin' GZA, Now thanks to Pizzah
I'ma tote the pistol, And slang the white coke crystal
The papers stack up, young niggas back up
Give me the beat and ill rip the track up
Just in case you wanna act up


Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin' just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexin'
Po-po's guessin' if the stolen car about to do a drive-by
Wet 'em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry , but it ain't my time to even die-die 
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life 
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin' tattoo tears


I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears


Shit.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein' my opportunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin' this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 ways to hit they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals to every last mineral we institutionalized
Locked down, got me shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style


Yo I been losin' sleep, stayin' up way past late
With no hesitation K will lace 'em, now how the game tastin'
Awful good to me, let me see who would thought that
This shorty'll be a thug nigga, unsupported, never shorted
Winner, pleasurable sinner plus a rebel and, thuggin' and lovin' it enough to hug it like my next to kin
Bust it like a gang of Mexicans
They won't rush him on a solo
Watch me flexin' on 'em and stolen guns, bustin'
You should fuck the world before you fuck wit' me
Young nigga sheddin' TEC tears through these next years
Homie, tatted down and I think I'm addict now
For holding it down all around these immortal grounds


Said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
And I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me hahha
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears
I said it many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years

Has been wrong all this time

Break the raw down and sign truces
Then switch the next muthafuckin' date, fuck all excuses

Hopped out to get a dutch, but he left with his wig splitten

When beef pop off, we ain't the one to speak
Dressed in all black, driving sixteen hearses
With sixteen niggas, dropping sixteen verses

To me it's hard to tell what you really want
Quit acting mean to me, you're teasing me the way you flaunt
But you ain't hearing me, sincerely, I'm so attracted
Pictures of target practice making love on my mattress
Visions getting graphic
So realistic you could grab it, it's a proven fact
Baby gotta have it, my love making quite magic
Tricks is for kids bunny rabbit, let a man have it
Bet you'd be satisfied if you tried my habit
High performance is hard to handle
Naked in the bubble bath while I'm burning candles
Sex me like a slow song
If fucking you was bad baby then I'm so wrong
My feeling's so strong
I keep staring like you can't see me

Bitches flocking up eying nothing, all about them papers
We're standing away from the player-haters and the impersonators
But we're sporting Gators and we don't cater to no hoe
From San Diego to Vallejo and all the way down to Idaho
You know, you wonder why this game don't change
They say you gotta have a way from the very start
So when I step into a club like Magic Cities
They be greedy with passion and the whole Atlantic city
And pull up to a seed that had never sparked
And post up, just like the Double R
Don't get mad; cause a nigga ain't spent shit

Don't doubt me, you got me hardship, your pussy all on my dick
I sleep with Dubs down your drawers
Take it from my dogs, where your ass be at, bitches all their ass
Shaking asses and titties but you they say don't touch
I wanna fuck, that's all I wanna do to suck
All in the guts  quick and fast
Watching and clocking, ain't no stopping when the music popping
Homie having fun with no gun 
Death Row got the party off the hook
I take the Chronic, I take a book 


As soon as my eyes open, the first thing hits
Me and the homies on the strip, fuck around with some Swiss
As soon as I hit the corner I'm on ya, eyes on scope
I'm about to soothe on my way to see Daz, 'Pac and Snoop
There's something cute about five foot six
And no sweat, I'm on set for the triple double twist
That's why I trip, I got to clear my mind
Take a couple hits of this bomb
Nate Dogg hit the switch to say fuck you bitch
Cause if I spent I'm taking two pussy, I just wanna fuck
Even though deep down I know she got some bomb ass pussy
So what would you do? roll, pass and just stop
Or coast up on the corner like a dog and just watch
WATCH!! WATCH!! WATCH!! WATCH!! WATCH!!

This is where we run, don't walk
Away from her as fast as we can move
Don't you remember what she did
The last time you let her in
Did you forget the pain she put us through?
I wouldn't go there if I were you
Heart, stick to beating, stop all this feeling
Ain't you tired of being her fool?
When her hips start swaying my lips start saying
Don't you know you're gonna get broke right in two?
I wouldn't go there if I were you

Try not to think too much about the fire that's in her touch
How her kiss can make you come unglued
That sweet look in her eyes
It's all part of her disguise
That's the devil wearing that perfume
I wouldn't go there if I were you

You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay

Not fooling anyone these days

There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid


We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man that never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came


So, baby, now I'm going

Running from all that you feared in your life

Forget the way you lead me through the path into heaven
To leave me behind?

She's a little old cowgirl from out Texas way
Counting the nights until the fiddler plays
Working all week just doing her thing
She likes punching doggies but she loves to swing


And when she hears that back-beat rhythm drifting through the door
She can't talk, she can't sit still, she can't stay off of that floor
Kicking her heels up lordly look at her twirl
Everybody wants to boogie on down
With the little old cowgirl


She's got skin tight blue jeans, a big Stetson hat
Knee high boots well how about that
That rodeo buckle sure does shine
She cuts a two-step in a travelling line

So listen up cowboy, here's a little advice
Before you make your move son you'd better think twice
Because she don't stop and she won't go
Until they bring that house down with the cotton-eyed Joe

Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?
Just another dummy caught up in the system
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard
Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak, yo
Should I be mentally weak, verse being Malik? Yo
Should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that?
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?
The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement


Melanated shrouded in complexity
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity
Mouth translate happens organically
The media relates it what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk
Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain
I'm chillin', felon down to the DNA crime willin'
Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons
Pumping false religions to all of these niggas' systems
Every voice devoid of the truth
Come on, listen


Man look at this, man look at this
Whatever will be will be
Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams
Certainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killers' capture
Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way
The rarity is in the rear, but never today
Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play
On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz
And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs
You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind
Yes, the government will fund, learning is free for everyone
And from that lie, young leaders will rise
In the eyes of despair and adversity
In some universe, this verse will be true


Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be

"Whoa-oh prisoner, my pretty
Whoa-oh prisoner

A black ocean is the sky above
Tiny lights bob, what star you from
Trapped in material plane
She wants to fly and they think she’s insane, but
She knows what she know
Give that girl wings and that’s all that she wrote

Twilight zone, twilight zone
I’m floating in the dark alone and
Is there any love out here, let me know

A laser light pinpoints the top of my dome
Then through my body as if Scotty’s
Beaming up a wayward soul
Mutant races in an ancient universe
Dark shadows, humans rhymin’ in a reggae verse

It’s gone if you blink
I can see it as soon as you think it

Good calls, crystal balls on sidewalk malls
Psychic people outdoors readin’ palms

I believe that you know more
To survive the dimension is four

Whoa-oh prisoner, my pretty
Whoa-oh prisoner

Look at the way she’s searching
Trapped in a world that’s hurting
So bad it makes her cry
But I won’t let her say goodbye

Twilight zone, twilight zone
I’m floating in the dark alone and
Is there any love out here let me know

Twilight zone, twilight zone

Is there any love out here let me know

A happy morning, morning, you see

What a beautiful day
The Lord has whispered something in my ear
Well, it's nothing sad
But it's something never ever brings a tear
I thank the Lord for my time
He gave unto my friend
Now I think it's time that we get together
And walk on in

See, I'm trying to be good like my Jesus

I can't stop loving you

I'm gonna keep on loving you

See, I cried when I wouldn't
I wouldn't take nothing for the man
There are other times when I don't
I don't really think I can


But He's been so good

But He's been so good
Loving you
Keep on loving
Let me keep loving
Keep on loving
Keep on giving
Keep on singing

And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, ""Come and see."" And I saw, and behold a white horse


There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around


Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks


Till Armageddon no salam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around


Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundred weight and penny pound
When the man comes around


And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts. And I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and hell followed with him

You know what it is, turn my mic up
Turn my muh'fuckin' mic up on these faggot ass niggas
THAT'S MY WORD...


I'm linked to the loonies, yeah a live wire
Though I think like them Sunnis, shit, I never tire
Social drinker if you knew me
Plus, I'm a buyer
All bottles on me baby , put your bids in
Without a plan I just ran, and I slid in
Hundred grand, now we fam, I could fit in
Fake love from these Matrix thugs
So move, nothin' personal, or take these slugs
I'm back, the MAC double, clap
Strap to the lap in the hatch back
With the duffle pack, puffin' a sack
I never nap, but I see niggas sleep on me
So for that, I'ma make 'em sleep eternally
AZ the archangel, my smarts is tangled
So I could dumb at any time or send them sharks to bang you
Chains dangle, charms all glossy and lit
So like that shit Flava Flav said, stay off his dick



Get yo' shit right, nigga

Get yo' shit right, muh'fucka

Get yo' shit right
Or get your bitch ass bodied tonight


First the, Lex off the lot then the Jag came next
Then them cheques started pop, and these crabs got vex
But when you, fresh off the block, you just laugh at threats
So baby pa, I'm a star for real, so no stress
One of the best that made that transition, sold the Beamer
Never a bitch nigga, stand pissin', got a, cold demeanor
Full of that ambition, still, hold the Nina
So no disrespect, but don't be 
I'm a steamer, puff trees consecutively
Classic shit all day like, B.I.G
Passionate, how I spit on this M-I-C
So pardon me, but y'all puffers better PYT
I am he, the most hated, but the hoes favorite
Flows flagrant, hall of famer like Joe Namath
You know I'm heinous, so why violate my slot?
I'm as serious as a Muslim when he makin Salah



Get yo' shit right, nigga

Get yo' shit right, muh'fucka

Get yo' shit right
Or get your bitch ass bodied tonight


Made for the silver screens, vocals is vivid
Play the shade in the Philippines, I, blow through some digits
Still a fiend for the illest jeans, I'm supposed to live it
Was chose, like them Gucci soles that expose the signatures
No limit from the start, never seen a finish
With heart and a little smarts, proceeds is endless
It depends on what mark is left, if a OG's remembered
And how I chow was just part of my style, hear me now?
Cross paths with the craziest that, had no conscience
You know that kingpin, 80's shit, when they spaz they monsters
Get ya ass found chopped up in a trash bag in Yonkers
Thank God they only rappin' today, it's that real
I know some big wills that's still tryin' to, appeal they case
Baby face, biddin' niggas since '88
So I'ma skate 'til I slip and, shipped upstate
I know y'all hatin' ass niggas can't wait, muh'fuckas...

Red lipstick on and high heel stilettos

Had me waiting in line, couldn't even let go

No more having to chase

Surround your ass with so many shots you'll be claustrophobic
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit
I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish

I can fuck her anywhere I want
I even fuck her on the floor

Does it end with your heart in your hand?
Fuck it, if the money bag in the other hand, that was the plan
Let that nigga spoil you
I guess somebody else on grind mode
But a nigga that provide though
Put his pride to the side though, and you my slime, so

So she dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
I'm 'bout to put my hands on her like E. Honda

She dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna

That's some sick shit! Money Team


See, this Dedication mixtape series is so important to the culture because they say it is. It's plain and simple, plain and simple. I don't label it important to the culture. If I have ever labelled it important to the culture I was feelin' myself and smellin' my drawers -- uh, pause -- I'm old, my mama used to always say that, my grandma used to say that ""You smellin' your drawers."" -- but anyway, I don't know if y'all people say that, I'm from the south -- but yeah, the Dedication mixtape series is important to the culture because the culture say it's important. So that's why I still jump my ass in these motherfuckin' booths, wherever I can find a booth, most likely the same one, and do my motherfuckin' thing. And I gotta keep doing my thing and that's why I do my thing because the culture say it's important. They say ""We want that, we need that, we gotta have that."" It make the-it make the world know what I mean? It make the music world spin, and that's what it's all about, and it's 'cause they say it

They show my picture for the crimes of another guy

And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
On the people passing by

One day they went a walkin'
Along the railroad track

Who used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough

If they're washin' their frijoles in Duz and Lux

All the ground had been peppered with a load of mines
Growing our own food was a risk at any time
The sudden brutality we had to confront
Forced us many years to a life into the ground
When

After having hidden
For so long under


I found I was missing all sensation of sight
It was so dark underground we had seen no light for days
What was visible how there was the enemy
The fact that they were fighting against their better nature
Our voices had been buried to breathe arise
For we had not to speak a word for days on end
But
What we learned
Was so strong

"Boy got paparazi, rich lead to slum

Let him think the grass is greener, it always is for someone

Pilgrims and penitents, saying it's the end of the world

Let them wallow in their sorrow

I want to live like there's no tomorrow, with you girl

World turns 

Spins round 

Goes round and around and around and around

I'm spellbound

All day 

All night 

Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down, shake it down

I'm spellbound

Sun probes and moon shots explore the universe

Outer space must be a great place

Yet we're stranded here on earth

With tit for tat killers, junkie gurus

Let them wallow in their sorrow

I want to live like there's no tomorrow, just with you

Spins round 

Goes round and around and around and around

When you showing me all the ways of love
Damn, it drives me crazy, I can't get enough
So many before, never really sure
But you showed me, baby


What it really means to give your heart to someone
Can't even lie that was something I never done
Until you came along and made me better
I don't have to look farther, girl, yes, it's true


I don't never need nothing if I got you 
Just wanna give you my love, wanna give it all to you

Anything you want, I'll do it
I know what real love is and girl, we gonna make some
I know that I'm gonna please your body
Leaving you wanting more, I'm sure

In due time I'm the modern day Albert Einstein
I'm prime time like Deion
And the rest of y'all is peons
I pee on the best
Whoever you are you can step
Like a prosthetic leg
I see monsters in my head
That's why I rap with such aggression
I tear down studio sessions
Rappers scared, they walk in the booth
With a bible and a reverend
I use my mouth as a weapon
Bullets rip through your mid section
Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
I'm a Comptown, nigga get a casket
Go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
Because I've got to eat
And for real I'm feeling kind of famished
Hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
Show me where your fans is so they can see the real
I'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend
But I'm not an actor, put that in my will
Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing
She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin
Tell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks
Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks
Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn
I'm not concerned about the SoundScan
Cause most of y'all is drowning
A lifeguard that's lounging
Meaning I don't worry about none of you rappers
I'm way more live
That's evil backwards
Now with that great word play
I tend to let my words play
Like children on a Saturday
It's sad to say you're not up to par
And I don't play with mini golf and sharks
Jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
Bled like Jay Rock or Big Wy
And make sure you wear a vest
Because they my family ties
Suit up
You got a three piece? I got a three piece
A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE
He backpedaling like a DB
I'm such a Martian
Call me ET
Always behind it like I own the TP
I shit, fart, pee pee
On anybody track
Walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax

Now phone home

Your boy carry that flame I am a arsonist
I spit arsenic at you niggas cartilage
Ill wip, drive by, niggas carsick

Try and reach we specialize in garbage
Taking out the trash put you underneath the tar pits
How many times I gotta tell y'all niggas the big fish in the small pond
I wail on niggas I'm vicious

Every chick I fuck with is a dime

Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya

Which road will lead you there
Last time you fell and you hit hard
Your wounds have healed by now
But you still see your scars, yeah
But it’s not the way it used to be right now
You come so far to just let this go my friend, don't go out


The same way you did the last time
You’ll break when you fall
Don’t make the same mistakes you did all over
You’ve got to believe in yourself this time


Live on, live it up today

So drink it up I say, yeah
Say it’s mine so give it all up to me now
And walk that line, don’t let this go, don’t go out

There's a blue bird at my window
I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in heaven
They don't look the same to me
I just wade the tides that turned
'Til I learn to leave the past behind


It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine


All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Have no time to watch them grow
Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me


It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine


Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missing
Missing all this time

Or taking a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on summer from a slot machine

We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?


Well, you roll on roads
Over fresh green grass
For your lorry loads
Pumping petrol gas
And you make them long
And you make them tough
But they just go on and on
And it seems that you can't get off

Well you've cracked the sky
Scrapers fill the air
But will you keep on building higher

Will you make us laugh
Will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live
Will you tell us when to die?

Now this is the 'Grey Goose'
Down in my home, people go to church on a Sunday
A Baptist church—and they had a preacher which was a pastor of that church
Instead of he going to church that Sunday, he went out and tried to kill a grey goose, and the goose is still laughin' at him


One Sunday mornin', Lord, Lord, Lord
Preacher went a-huntin', Lord, Lord, Lord
He carried 'long his shotgun, Lord, Lord, Lord
'Long come a grey goose, Lord, Lord, Lord
Gun went ""a-boo-loo!"" Lord, Lord, Lord
He was six weeks a-fallin', Lord, Lord, Lord
He was six weeks a-haulin', Lord, Lord, Lord
Then my wife an' your wife, Lord, Lord, Lord
Get a-feather-pickin', Lord, Lord, Lord

Put him on a parboil, Lord, Lord, Lord
He was six weeks a-boilin', Lord, Lord, Lord
And they put him on a table
And the fork wouldn't stick him
And the knife wouldn't cut him
Then they throwed him in the hog bin
And the hog couldn't eat him
And he broke the hog's teeth out
And they put him in the sawmill
And the saw couldn't cut him
And he broke the saw's teeth out
And the last time I seen him, Lord, Lord, Lord

With a long thing of goslings, Lord, Lord, Lord

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues


'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you


It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor  and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl you better have fun
No matter what you do
But he's a fool


'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you


All the flowers that you planted, mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Thinking now that things won't be the same

But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?

"If you'll gather 'round me, people
A story, I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife, she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down

Now, he took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name

He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door

Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill

'Twas in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say:

You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief

Well, it's through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen

Well, it's through this world you ramble
It's through this world you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home

Something snapped me out of a dream that I was having
I'd fallen down an elevator shaft but now I'm back again
Tidying up after the fight we had 


Happy with yourself, well you've never looked so satisfied
Teasing me with stuff like a spoilt little brother
You finished yet? Have you got what you really want? 


Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again
Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again
Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again
Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again
Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again
Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again
Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again
Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again

Dreamin' of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm comin' home
Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise you are everything I want
This is for you, baby listen, it's your song


Oye cariño, sólo pienso en ti
When I wake up in the morning until I go back to sleep
How I wish you were mine
I think of you all the time
I always feel like I'm flying
Baby, you make me feel fine
Lost in the words that you say to me
Y pasando tiempo juntos is the ultimate dream
I'm on the top of the world
Baby girl can't you see
I found my perfect girl
I want to make you my queen
Time and time again I can be feeling real sad
'Cause mi sueño no se ha hecho una realidad
Pero el tiempo dirá, el tiempo dirá
If we go spend our life together en lo que el mundo gira
I promise I don't want nobody else to be around me but you
And nobody's touch and nobody's lips can make me feel like yours do
Our hands interlock, nuestros labios se conocen
Nuestra noche es corta pero hermosa we'll be okay


Dreamin' of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm comin' home
Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise you are everything I want
This is for you, baby listen, it's your song


Sin ti mis días son largos y se sienten tan amargos
Me ahogo en un lago de mis lágrimas que hago
Can't look forward to my future if it ain't including you
Promise that I'm gonna love you
It's about that time you knew
I swear I don't see nothing better than to lay here with you
And I hope you know I miss you
From my head I can't dismiss you
Eres lo que yo anhelaba en esta vida que me falta
Lo que siento is surreal
I can't lie to you for real
Sabes bien que te quiero
And if you're down to spend your summer with me just let me know
You know you are my sueño
You came to my life and now I feel alright


Dreamin' of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm comin' home
Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise you are everything I want
This is for you, baby listen, it's your song

Dreamin' of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm comin' home

After seventeen years behind bars
And lookin' back on his mistakes
He sat down and poured out his heart
When his son came to see him today
He spoke with a voice that trembled
Tryin' to hold back the tears
He said I ain't been much of a father
Son, I wish I could turn back the years


'Cause life's like a river
And the water is deep
Cross it with care
Or you'll end up like me
Let my mistakes
Be your steppin' stones
And walk on the rocks that I stumbled on


He said son stay away from the bottle
Watch out for the company you keep
And hold on to those you love
'Cause love is a man's greatest need
The right way may not be easy
The right road ain't always straight
Son, please don't follow the footsteps
That lead to where I am today


'Cause life's like a river
And the water is deep
Cross it with care
Or you'll end up like me
Let my mistakes
Be your steppin' stones
And walk on the rocks that I stumbled on


Walk on the rocks that I stumbled on

Hugged your friends
Kissed your mama goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why from me
Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the state line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must have known what we were going to find


This ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancing
Without the sound
It ain't nothing no nothing
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're going to climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothing no it ain't nothing but a heartbreak town


Stardust well it's a funny thing
It can make you cuss
It can make you sing
And the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
I've seen them rise
I've seen them fall
Some get nothing
And Lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawl away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm going to need you
Down this yellow brick road


This ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancing
Without the sound
It ain't nothing no nothing
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're going to climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothing no it ain't nothing but a heartbreak town

I was a girl in a black Corvette
Getting head in the shadows
I was a Beatle floating in a bottle of red

'Til my own laugh gave me the creeps
I watched a scorpion crawl across my feet

Now you're at my door, trick or treat

And now that you've cracked me open wide to see
That I was living my life in stencil
But the rainbow was inside of me

I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
I'm a soldier

Started off with, runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin for righteous
Gettin twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin to get us
ATF state feds scandalous bitches
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet
See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat
Only streets livin do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin Thug Life, comin equipped, with many gats
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul, trapped in time
Livin in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain




My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with
A three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut
My Mom Dukes got a little bit of Thug in her
The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin over
Never stayin sober, the brain over and over backtrack
My stack's fat, I used to take new




I was born twenty-two years ago, yesterday
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon
To be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin the time of day


Thug niggas screamin Westside, bustin double Glocks...
You gotta be soldiers alright!

I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring
He's cleaned with the tears
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting-


I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can


I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind
He lives in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine
But I in my leather and lace
I can never become that kind


I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can


I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
There's no one to blame
No there's no one to name as a traitor here
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year


I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

And it's the lightness in the air

Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did


I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

No, I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

But it just don't work out that way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again

They laughed at their gods
And fought them in vain
So he turned his back on them
And left them in pain
Now here come the saints
With their banners held high
Each one of them martyrs
Quite willing to die


Wake the dead, the saints are in Hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell


Cover your fists
Razor your spears
It's been our possession
For 8,000 years
Fetch the scream eagles
Unleash the wild cats
Set loose the king cobras
And blood sucking bats




We are saints
In hell
We are saints
In hell
We're going down
Into the fire
We're going down
Into the fire
The streets run with blood from the mass mutilation
As carnage took toll for the bell
Abattoir, abattoir, mon Dieu quelle horreur
For a time is was like second hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
The battle is over, the saints are alive
How can we all thank you, we felt so despised

I'm a hard working man
I wear a steel hard hat
I can ride, rope, hammer and paint
Do things with my hands that most men can't
I can't get ahead no matter how hard I try
I'm getting really good at barely getting by
Got everything I own
By the sweat of my brow
From my four-wheel drive to my cowboy boots
I owe it all to my blue collar roots
I feel like I'm working overtime on a runaway train
I've got to bust loose from this ball and chain


I'm a hard, hard working man
I got it all on the line
For a peace of the promised land
I'm burning my candle at both ends
'Bout the only way to keep the fire going
Is to outrun the wind


Come Friday night
I like to party hard
I carry on with the Cadillac cuties
Spend my whole week's pay on some weekend beauty
Come Monday morning I'm the first to arrive
I ain't nothing but business from nine till five




I can't wait to get up in the morning
And do it all over again
Well I'm a hard living, hard working man

What did close in here?
I can't remember ever shedding tears o'spite
On this ground, cropping up the fatal frontline
Like a soot-blackened palisade yet
Impelled, void and abulic
Legions delineate an ominous skyline

As lifeless demons without soul
These insentient hosts abide
Engulfing warmonger get away from here!
Trod ye the path of vast deceit?
Every piece of evidence was a lie
The war, the threat's a hyping fake
To move figures on the board!

Stain Bibracte's ground!


What do you see in me?
Do you breathe-in dreams?
What spurred you to come here?
An oneiric picture of being...


Like disaffected legions taken, lure
I wonder what lies, what threat or promise
Persuaded them to leave their home that far away
...did they really know?


As the carnyx roared aloud
I quaked not, yet just asked myself
How their hearts took the bait
These sweetened words of bitter essence

Face to face with nameless foes
Scorching words, unspoken lorn
Unheard quests remain the ashes of the dead


What do you see in me?
Do you breathe-in dreams?
What spurred you to come here?
An oneiric picture of being...


Forsooth we'll bear the brunt
Upright in life or in death
Yet still the countless cries echo
In silenced caves of nothing


What do you see in me?
Do you breathe-in dreams?
What spurred you to come here?
An oneiric picture of being...

Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said ""would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me I'm feeling a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said ""when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead""
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

"One dream in all of us still shining
One star, the everlasting light
So alone, so lost inside, to the end in paradise
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight

In the dark December morning light
Fallen strong to the burning winds, the fires of Hell will forsake me
Shattering the chains that ever bind us
Suffering their pain eternally

Four strong, smash the silence, carry on like before
Fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away
Storm winds, hellfire raging, sun shines down as they kneel
Lost in times and long forgotten, galloping miles away

Tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by
Still alive we feel the pain tonight
Stars fall through blackened clouds, in dreams sadness reigns
Twilight star in a thousand lights for me, oh!

One dream in all of us still shining
One star, the everlasting light
So alone, so lost inside, to the end in paradise
Salvation of mankind returns

And still we say a prayer for the world
Life brings hope for us all
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight

One dream in all of us still shining
One star, the everlasting light

One dream in all of us still shining
One star, the ever lasting light
So alone, so lost inside, to the end in paradise

I feel lost
Conflicting thoughts course through
Clarity, she's gone
Don't know a thing I thought I knew

Everyone wants to see heaven
But no one wants to say goodbye
Everyone wants to see heaven
But no one wants to die


Can't escape this feeling 
Can't escape this feeling 
I hear voices  in my head
Choices  I can't contend
I hear voices  and they all know your name
They all know your name


Trapped inside a cell that I built myself
Felt so very empty, cold, dark, and lost

Everyone wants to know God
But they're afraid of what they'll find
Everyone wants to know God
But they want to live like He died


Can't escape this feeling 
Can't escape this feeling 
I hear voices  in my head
Choices  I can't contend
I hear voices  and they all know your name
They all know your name


I feel it all, I feel it all around
I heard it call, it doesn't make a sound
Was in my hand and now I see, believe
I hear you left, I know you're here with me


Can't escape this feeling 
When the Spirit moves you 
I hear voices  in my head
Can't escape the Ghost when the Ghost is not dead
I hear voices  and they all know your name
They all know your name


I hear voices  in my head
Choices  I can't contend
I hear voices  and they all know your name
They all know your name

These streets remind me of quicksand 
When your on it you'll keep goin down 
And there's noone to hold on too
And there's noone to pull you out
You keep on fallin 
And noone can here you callin
So you end up self destructing
On the corner with the tuli on the waist line just got outta the bing doin state time
Teeth marks on my back from the canine
Dark Memories of when there was no sunshine
Cause they said that I wouldn't make it

Een gebied vol verdriet hele wijken falliet
Een bandiet die weer schiet in de ronte voor niets het is een
Plek waar je vermoord word voor een simpele fiets
Ik heb het over de ghetto's van de verenigde staten
Waar kinderen van twaalf rond lopen met een wapen
Maar ook in nederland is het niet altijd wat het lijkt criminaliteit
Stijgt in de achterstands wijk kijk ik wil niet zeggen
Dat de bijlmer als new york is maar heel veel van die mensen
Doen of het een dorp is waar nooit iets gebeurd terwijl
De flats zijn bezet door de junks aan de crack je houd jezelf
Voor de gek...

Jongens stap het liefst je verdriet is diep van binnen
Je wilt wel opnieuw beginnen maar je word geconfronteerd
En je ziet van die dingen je broertje gearesteerd
Je vader zakt zachtjes neer je moeder kan niet meer
Het doet je zeer
Je dropt die tranen kijkt uit het raam het is alsof je wijk is getroffen door een orkaan overal liggen vuilnis zakken
Er lopen ratten junkies die elkaar om een bolletje willen klappen
Politie rijd voorbij en ziet iedereen als verdachte
In een keiharde wereld is er geen ruimte voor een zwakte
Survivor of the fittest, hoeveel heb je in petto
Is de Eeuwen oude vraag als je leeft in de ghetto...

Guess who's back?


Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press REC on your deck
Here we go, set? Pass the Moët
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me!
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, ""Hi,"" and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test
Of givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact
I'm fightin it back but now I snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back

One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks to makin hits, bustin flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black tape
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, WHY ME?
No lie, niggas cried when they try me
Givin up the roughness, justice
I'mma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get a grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick. Guess who's back?

"When was it that you lost your youth or traded
It for something more for them to use, so jaded
Why is it that you never said
I love you more than just a friend?
I pray this gridlock never ends
And when we get there just depends

I found out recently that you are leaving
For good I hope I softly tell my ceiling
It's better now to be alive
Sleeping is my 9 to 5
I'm having nightmares all the time
Of running out of words that rhyme

Everything that you could never say
Would never matter anyway
I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago
Before that steak knife took my eyes
I looked up to the sky
For the last thing I would ever see
For the last time I'd cry

When was it that you sold your life or wasted
Every bite of that small slice you never tasted?
I guess I should be one to talk
There's nights that I can't even walk
There's days I couldn't give a fuck
And in between is where I'm stuck

From blocks away I heard somebody screaming
That small child inside of you that you left bleeding
You stabbed him up not once but twice
Cubicles will now suffice
Some say it's the roll of the dice
I think they're wrong, I know I'm right

Every breath that I could barely breathe
Could barely make it past my teeth
I took a blowtorch to both of my lungs a long, long time ago
And every step that I could take
Is one more difficult to make
Mr. Chainsaw came and took my legs a long, long time ago

In case you're wondering, I'm singing about growing up, about giving in
In case you're wondering, I'm singing about growing up, about giving in
In case you're wondering, we're singing about growing up
About growing up and giving in

So they only see it late nights like Jay Leno
I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck
No she lying
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
You abusing the game you defiant
Disobedient student need attention
Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son
I am Dwyane Wade of recording
You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements
That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless
I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I suppose I handle the rock well
I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel.
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means consecutive championships
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball
The same way I handle it with no pen
I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off
He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court
Alley oop the court let him do what he want
Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports
How bout football?
I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984
I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field like Ray Buchanan
When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
Hip-hop cops on me I dodge them like Barry
Sanders... John Madden hold your commentary
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I keep going?
Aw fuck it let me keep going
I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens
Not the ‘07 T Owens
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Y'all need to work on y'all defense, I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey
One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
MVP of LA, call the doctor
I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
It’s about time for halftime reporting
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
You ain’t nice till you play all positions
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
You might say… ouch
Just let me score one time
Dribble my balls to the floor one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan
I am the Jeff Gordon of recording
I am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding
I am Michael Irv before the coke snortin'
Aw fuck it I’m what’s ever important

He threw down a glove, you made the mistake
Of picking it up, now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance


Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for your life


Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow


Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for your life




The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile, the reaper looks on

Fought for the splendour
Fought for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fought for the honour

Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine


The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?


Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?


When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?


To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing’s right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light


I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead


Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?




But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don’t believe it, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead

A picture of perfection
The object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I’m on a mission, got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady, yellin' out spots for me to hit, and ""aw shit""
Soon as I seen her, saw us playin' hide the weiner
Want a ""Freak Like Me"", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holler out my name when a thug nigga ride, ""Can I cum inside?""
Say you don't feel it, that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye when I walked by, I said ""Hi""
But you were so shy, I can't lie, damn-near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it, and even worse
Got your heart set on me going first, and that ain't no fair exchange!

Ain't no robbery

Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw your legs out the window
Remember on the balcony? Bend over baby, bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my ""Temptations""
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it 'cause you walk around actin' like you're perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange!

Now your attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true, I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you're gettin' dick
And since you're bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you're so twisted think your legs breakin'
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait until you asleep and that's the payback
'Cause you're actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange

As the world turns…
As the world turns my niggas grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggas die and mommas cry
Niggas got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggas fame, as the world turns…


Though I walk through the valley of Hell the shadow follows me. Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded. Merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
If we search deeper
God bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deep as Poseidon
When we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears
Like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year

Killin' busters is my motherfuckin' job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggas reported missin'
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns…

Time to keep my green buildings, maintained with no fillings
For these weak motherfuckers, my heat street suckers 
New street geek plucka', a long wrap without a rubba'
Listen to my Bompton, Outlaw blast the Compton, Gettin' half in pumpin 
I cluck the razor slap it chocolate, Hey Now
Got a lotta G's on the way now, Marcy and paydown
My niggas blownin' up, getting paid now


Precision in my favors, unanimous decision
Fuck a religion dead on collision with the walls of prison
A street mercenary, lieutenant penned it
Move it down like Emmett, only five minutes in it
Got my town extended, Sadam Hussan
A Big San, San Wan, I'm the first the bomb
Dear Mama I disrespected ways to your vagina
Household de-ca, when the cops was behind ya'
Some niggas got crippled, money still gettin' tripled
Suckers'll stick you, I keep my hands on the pistol
It's drastic, niggas'll set you up for the casket
Fake teardrops, real closed casket they got it mastered
Unprofessionally, I crawl with aggressional
Thoughts me and my gats, climbs apps like a sexual
For this pain and agony, I feel allegated gravity
And my heart hurt, like I got voodoo pins stabbin' me



Rest in Peace Soldier

As The World Turns



Only haters caught feelings when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin'
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas – mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin', armies ridin', soldiers born wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now, as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nothin' left to earn


October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my MAC-11 hit the block playin'
Only five years up in this bitch, papa runnin' from the feds
Puttin' peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown, but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin' straight shots of Cristal Brothers
100 dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin' pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns


Aye-yo! 
Which one of y'all niggas out there gettin' money out there
Who gettin' money, REAL G's nigga!
Fuck that lil' five hundred ten dollar shit that lil' hundred dollar shit
I'm talkin' bout brand new creep
BLACK JESUS, I know he sees and only he can feed us
I believe you, you believe us
Only leaders no followers
All these niggas tryna' get his advice but they swallow us WHOLE
I take yo' soul nigga lost CONTROL, is ya' bad and BOLD?
, my .44 GO, Four-Four, and they drop
When a nigga picture all you using a cop 
Anybody that try to stop me take me off this planet I can't STAND you trick ass niggas if you try to ban this here
Have no fear The Outlawz have come nigga disappear when we run 
When we come when we ride
Suicides and homicides is what we supply
Niggas die don't cry now 
You Die Now 
What you found, niggas from the pound, three fifty-seven, all the way to heaven 
My MAC-11 keep these niggas breathin', who do you believe in?
Only he can see us, BLACK JESUS

On the day I was born, the rain fell down
There was trouble brewin' in my home town
It was the seventh day, I was the seventh son

All you women, come along with me
And I'll show how good a bad boy can be

All over town




I wouldn't tell you no story
Tell you no lie
I was born to love 'till the day I die
I just line 'em up
And I knock them down
And they all came a running when the word got around

My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain, my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive

Sit down and sup with the top rap reps

You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do

Might catch me in a burgundy chair, my shirt blockin'
Fresh with my bandanna and Timbs, we outta there
Pushin' to the limit like Montana did

Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggas trip and, yo, it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggas get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey!
I'm gettin' sweated by these undercovers
Who can I trust, got my mama stressin', thinkin' it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We livin' a drug life, THUG LIFE, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin' fast

Flow relentless, overseas or must

You need a reason to believe
A reason to deceive
A reason for the song you're singing 
And everything you do makes perfect sense to you
So why is your alarm bell ringing?


You say you know how it feels inside of me 
Lost and alone with no love or luxury 
Come on inside and hear the silence constantly judging me 
Don't you think you should move on?


Aah-ya look, you're so 


You need a way to get along
A way to carry on
A symptom for the pain you're making
And surely, you should know
That everywhere you go
There's acid in the words you're faking


You say you know how it feels inside of me 
Lost and alone with no love or luxury 
Come on inside and hear the silence constantly judging me 
Don't you think you should move on?


You write it, so you best believe it
You sold it, now your soul perceives it
You waiver, but for now, agree with it

Thinking of you, wide awake for days

Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house

Step four, stop off at Edgebrook Creek
And rinse your crimson hands

You see, Jack and Jill, they're going to join their misery
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray

You can see they've finally taken cover
You can see they're willing to obey
Their vows are difficult, they're for each other
So let nobody put a loophole, a loophole in their way

I left my shawty inside the basement
My .40 my shawty, I gotta name it

They waitin' for a retaliation
They lookin' for a retaliation
They started up an investigation
Started off with a nigga hatin'

I'm hearin' rumors, a lot of rumors
Word on the streets is that I'm a shooter
They lookin' for reasons to send me to precincts
That wasn't no weed, I was smokin' hookah
My shawty a diva, I love to screw her
I put it in deep and then I maneuver
She listens to me when I'm talkin' to her
I wish I knew her before I knew her
I wish that I knew her 'fore I started fuckin' with bitches
That can't even say they love me
Couple niggas I grew up with don't even fuck with me no more
It's probably because of money
You switchin' your crew up, you ain't livin' comfortable nigga
You know you a fuckin' dummy
I'm rollin' that glue up and it's gettin' stuck to my fingers
Can somebody roll it for me?
I'm done with the percies, I gave it up
'Cause nobody else would have gave a fuck
I pray for niggas that hated us
Yeah, I got me a bag and I ran it up
I got me a check and then I had to flex on bitches
That said I wasn't good enough
I got me a weapon, yeah, I had to check them niggas

Wrong side of town on the second floor
Couple blocks down from the liquor store
I got a love seat and a couple DVD's we can watch
...or not
I can call a car it will be two minutes
'Til it's at the bar and we hop in it
It's pretty clear that we're both here to get over someone


So if you wanna come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and baby I got mine


But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you’ve been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you


There's a reason that we're both here right now
And a reason everything didn't work out
We're two sets of previous relationships at the same time


Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you’ve been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye

Aw, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! 


Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now!  I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
 Shut the fuck up! 
 You think I give a fuck?!
C'mon! We're going for a ride, bitch!  Sit up front!

We'll be right back — well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong

Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!  Oh God, my brain is racin'
 What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? 
There's a -year-old little 
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!

What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!

You think I'm ugly, don'tchu?  No, you think I'm ugly
 Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!

And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?

That was funny, wasn't it?! 
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced 
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah! Somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

Forsake the world's plan and the things they covet

Rich niggas they at me, wanna cuff me, where's my wedding ring?
Real nigga, he fuck me like a dog, he say this pussy tame
A hater, I don't see her 'cause the money in the wizzay
Need them thousands in my bank account, he ate me like a Payday
When it's payday, every day-day, we go cray-cray, shout out Dae-Dae
Spendin' blue face, he gon' eat this ass and watch it up in Blu-ray
Bands in my purse, deuce deuce, in my D-cup
Pussy juice-juice, scare that nigga quick, hiccup
Ice keep me cold but this thirty is my heater

Right then left, diggin' a sweat
Head down, dead ground, shovel, step
Milk and honey, milk and honey
I don't kneel, I won't yield
Low light, no sight, tunnel Zeal
Silk and money, silk and money


So, where does the garden blossom deep within my soul?
All I know is striving for this harvest of fool's gold


Oh! Aimless knight
Oh! Faithless fight


Demon diamond, where you hidin'?
Keep me on a mission like a singin' siren
Rippin' up roots, diggin' up truths
Hacking at the vine, stacking up dead fruit
Get it, better pick up the pace
Today, don't waste away
Go and get it, better pick up the pace
Today, don't waste away

I didn't see you, I didn't care
Looking for lightning under the stairs
Hunting for feeling, firing a flare
Chasing the purpose out of despair
You were the one truth I wouldn't dare
Give me your blessing
Teach me your prayer
For beauty in stillness
Rest in the snare
Settle my spirit
Spirit, abide in me
Spirit, abide in me

Go ahead girl, let your hair down
Just close your eyes, it's going to be a damn good night

Dip dip dive, to the socialized
Issued rhythms that are on the rise
Step right up, with an opened circuit
Get this current, don't you know it's worth it
Presented with, Tribe-centricity
Compared, don't you know? Vibe electricity
Strong like a bomb, quick like a comet
Can I get whatever from Mr. Muhammad?

If Muhammad has the breaks, who will have the backs?
Bodies set it up all flow to rhythm stack
Okay I see my brother , you know what we can do 
Cruise with the rhythms , Shaheed will lead us to 
Posin with the hotties , harder than the hard 
Still Muhammad plays with a full deck of cards 
The Tribe's stuff is present , established with the beat 
We roll around on wheels  or utilize the feet 
Go and keep progressin , egos of the Tribe 
If we have to swing it  we won't take a dive 
Comprende my compadre?  Kid you want some more? 
Muhammad push the button , sample sing the score 

Brothers try to pose, up with the Tribesmen
Rhythm on your toes, yes it's the funk again
Appreciate the flow, denounce the circuit breakers
Do it with the best, the movers and the shakers
Bustin out your heap, ??? my vehicle
Burnin up the felts, rhythm's rough to me it will
Be strong like a bomb, quick like a comet
Can I get a whatever from Mr. Muhammad?

Fondeling the groove , with a mystic sense 
Cronies won't you try , they pushy and they're tense 
But I don't give a damn , rhythms are the thing 
Rhythms have the key , rhythms make you swing 
If you don't like it , you can pucker up 
You listenin Mr. Quayle , if you're hiding just give up

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Ah, ah, ah!""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go ""Ah, ah, ah!""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane, comes a rainbow

Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you know

Always trying to get me alone
An easy way to lose it all
Always there when all else fails
Over by the west side rails

But I don't really need that now
I never really did anyhow
I only really needed alcohol
Something that'll treat me okay
And wouldn't say the things you'd say

Please turn out the light
I get a sick confusion headache trying to figure out who's right

Dreaming on the silver strand
Waking up to plainclothes man
You little bastard, little boy in blue
Someone's gonna get to you
And fuck up everything you do

He's so unhappy inside
He's serious with everyone
And he thinks he'll win you with his angry kiss
Acting like he has no needs
Wanting you to watch him bleed

Made for each other bet you pay me any mind
Just goes to show my continual decline
They say that I'll recover my love of her once in a while
But I don't know
I don't think so...

There's something that I'll tell you now
Now that no one else is around
The sort of lesson that I learned from you
Not quite the way you planned
But I know you'll understand

Someone takes a photograph
A picture while their sweetheart laughs
A perfect moment in a flash of light
Counting back from 3 to 1
That's exactly what you've done

And I'm so unsurprised
I remember, I remember why I dream in black & white

Goes to show my continual decline
They say that I'll recover my love of her once in a while

Lose your hold of the flame, oh

I'm an educated fool
So don't know what is I'm supposed to do
About this awkward situation
That's been forced down right upon me
As I'm walking down into
On my own into the valley of life
Got a lifetime of experience
I've got so much to give


Open the page on chapter one
Could this just be that life's just begun
Forever within your darker thoughts
Reflecting on everything you've been taught


Never felt this way before
Seems that somebody's just opened
The door to the book of life
Or is it death?
Is there ever any way out?
Someone's looking down on me
To the very inner core of my soul
They won't tell me what they see
But I really want to know


I want to live my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return


Do you really want to be just another one statistic
Or feel that you really should aspire?
That you really do deserve more?
Do you ever really feel that you have so much potential inside?
What you really have to give could be realised so much more




Time will flow and I will follow
Time will go, but I will follow
Time will flow and I will follow
Time will go, but I will follow




I want to feel what life's like respond
I want to meet my father beyond
I want to walk right into the light
I want to feel no fear but delight
I want to live my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires

"There's a portrait of Uncle Alvarez
Hanging in the hall
Nobody wants to look at it
But Uncle Alvarez sees us all

Ho, ho, ho, imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy
You might even shake the hands of presidents
Better send a postcard and keep the family quiet

He's not really part Cherokee Indian
He didn't fight in the Civil War
He's just Eugene Isaac Alvarez
We feel sorry for the wall

Ho, ho, ho, imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy
You might even shake the hands of presidents
You're gonna make them sorry when you die

And it's a long way down
You're hoping for heart attack
Running around
And messing in this and that, and
Your beautiful wife keeps your life on a shelf for you
Safe in the bedroom where there's no dust or mildew and
It's hard to believe you were once a beautiful dancer...

Better just to shake it off
As you write your resumé
Don't think of Uncle Alvarez
And the price he had to pay

Ho, ho, ho, imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy
You might even shake the hands of presidents
You're gonna make them sorry when you die

There's a flaw in my flue

Your lovely face in my fireplace
Was all that I saw

Back in the time, back to the basis

So yo, KAM

KICK THAT SHIT -----] Flavor Flav


Man, real motherfuckin' fags everywhere
And keep positions in the game and it's just ain't fare
How they call the shots and they make the choice
In this business real niggas ain't got no voice
Rats in the videos catch small chat
Caught speed up in Cali' like they all that
I tried to get paid, but I can't get far
Cause they don't never wanna see real nigga Rap Star
But I was born, with a creative mind
Inclined to resurrect the deaf, dumb and blind ""That's right""
A nigga tried to troop, so when I ride on you
Man, only God knows what I'm gonna do
I roll through every ghetto, and be in every state show
When I move it, like I be movin' heavy weight
So all the places where y'all dip in and where y'all stay
Mayday, cause ain't body save today


Aiy, don't blame me like West Coast rap is dead
Y'all are tryin' not to break no bread


Okey, see, I'm a real G from head to toe

 It's like a struggle to rhyme, make you wanna just get outta California
 Then, where is my dreams?
 It's like a struggle to rhyme, make you wanna just get outta California


Devils gettin' mad
Radio and TV got niggas doin' too much, just tryin' to be Rap ??
All my niggas on the front line battle or fight
And can't even get to shine, man, you know that ain't right
Killers and gangsters, they ring my phone
And be askin' me: why I'm not on?
A lot of dumb hateration, just cause I'm in the nation
Can't get no love on TV, or the Radio Station
The cold ramp torture the nigga 'til he cracked
I just got to turn it down, most of these crackers really whack
A damn shame, it's so lame, a nigga case ignite
Right sometimes I think I do the same
That's where I might put it to tame


Aiy, don't blame me like West Coast rap is dead

These fools liars, they're all ain't nothin' but haters
They ain't thugs, pimps or pushers, these niggas is big fakers
Drivin' big cars on 20 Inch rims
But will they help you blow? ""No"" well alright then
They're suckers, faggots, blockers, maggots
Dick jackers and some of them even drug addicts
But you say I'm rude? - uh, I'm a nice dude
I just wind up knockin' out Ice Cube ""SOLO""
So now my thugs say: Homie, I don't need no record deal
Cause the East is the turf, I'm just keepin' it real
And all my niggas smokin' leafer, cause shit's gettin' deeper
Got them paranoid, tryin' to avoid the Grim Reaper
Keepin' hands on their heats, chucks on their feats
Wearin' white Ts and runnin' the streets
Cause it's all about money in this land of milkin' honey
So I'm down with Farhekahn, ain't a damn thing funny, nigga

In another world far away
And they say it's a freeland
And they welcome everyone to stay
You got to take me

Remember how to dream today

Dreamland, I need you
I close my eyes and you lead the way

We're falling for pleasure
In a garden where the sun still shines
And staying forever
Leaving all our worries behind
It's a kind of amnesia
Where all problems seem to disappear
And you don't need a visa
You can come and go and still be here


Dreamland, I Iove you
I dream of you all night and day
Dreamland, I need you
I close my eyes and you lead the way

I wish I were in Dublin or some other seaport town
I'd set my foot on a steamboat and sail the ocean 'round
Sailing 'round the ocean, sailing 'round the sea
I think of handsome Molly wherever she may be
I am a beggar-man and a begging I have been
For three score or more on this little isle of green
I'm known from the Liffy on down to Segu
And I'm known by the name of Little Johnny Doo
Of all the trades a-going sure a-begging is the best
When a man gets tired he can lay his head to rest
He can beg for his supper when there's nothing else to do
Or go sit 'round the corner in his old rigadoo
We slept one night in a barn in Clairebon
We went naked all night and slept until the dawn
Holes in the roof and the rain a-pouring through
And the cats and the rats they were a-playing peek-a-boo
Who should awaken but the woman of the house
In a white spotted apron and a calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""Boo!""
""Don't be afraid ma'am, it's only Johnny Doo!""
Over the fields with a pack on my back
Over the hills with a creak in me sack
Holes in my shoes and my toes peeking through
Singing ""Shinkle and a wrinkle it's only Johnny Doo!""
Well, it's getting late at night and it's time to go to bed
And the fire's all out and whoops goes the light
Now you know the story of the old rigadoo
So good night and God be with you says Little Johnny Doo

Staring at herself in the bathroom mirror
Its just another deep breath
Half an hour and he'll be here
Its just another friend of a friend
Oh, it ain't nothing
Its only just a drink or two

Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick


Sitting at a red light
Staring at herself in the sideview mirror
He says shes beatiful 
Like he knows what she wants to hear
So she plays right along as the night goes on
It'll only be a drink or two

Uh, pain, pain...



They'll never take me alive
I'm gettin' high with my 4-5
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster
Causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labled as a troublemaker
Who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless
Rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb 'cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me
What should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family
What else could I do?
But be a thug
Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club
Got my mind on danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gangbangers and drive-bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young, but still a victim of the 12-gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin back to court, so fuck what you thought
I'm drinkin' Hennessy, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain


Thug soldier 'til I die
Keep family by my side
All night, I'm getting high
Life's so full of pain, have you ever seen a thug cry?
Mamas standing on the streets
Gotta get back on my feet
Stressed out, I can't sleep
Life's so full of pain, have you ever seen a thug cry?


I seen a couple niggas shot in the brain
Seen a couple niggas shot in the frame
And I'm tryna maintain
Tell the truth though, the shit ain't the same
I'ma die a thug, fuck it, it's the blood in my vein
Why complain 'cause we all gon' die, but I could wait
I'm the letter after F and right before H
I'm a G nigga, see nigga, the pain in my eye
Player player play the game and you die
I do a buck-85 and  the beam in the ride
Even hot from the flame of the 9
No stranger to danger in mine
Matter fact, I be bangin' for mine
Got a closet full of guns and I'm hangin' with mine
So much pain, yeah, I spent years doing sicker shit
If I cried, the tears'll probably be blood and liquor mixed
And you ain't seen a nigga on no bicker shit
Life's a bitch, bet you that all my niggas done twisted it

They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed
And ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust some motherfuckers with a PASSION
Better duck 'cause I ain't lookin when I'm BBBBLASTIN'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy
And gettin' high, on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why
'Cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across my face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
I keep my brain on tha game and stay head-strong
These sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
I'm real, they cannot see
And every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried
I was born to raise, hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother, I'm touched
I'm kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean, until they kill me
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me
There's so much pain

That feels different
From when your hands are in mine

Blowing skunk, getting crunk with my baby, oh, what's up?
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk

My little spawn of Satan just might take off with your fucking girl

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee

Chasing time, the days go by
I wonder where you went
Losing light to early nights
'Cause summer’s gone again


If you're feeling locked up and you wanna get free
Tryin' to live and love your life in positivity
Don’t be afraid when it comes, fear is only skin deep
Just come on, come on, yeah, come on, come on
When they got you on the run, but you wanna get free
'Cause you dwell under the spell of negativity
And when the world is crashing down, crumbling at your feet
Just lean into it, yeah, lean into it


In my head, it's make believe
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Life is not quite the way it seems
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh

Switching lanes, it's getting late
The road is closed ahead

And you dwell under the spell of negativity
And when the world is crashing down, crumbling at your feet
Just lean into it, yeah, lean into it


In my head, it’s make believe

Life is not quite the way it seems
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams


Sometimes sunshine is made of knives
A broken promise in disguise
The stars have got their fingers crossed
I’m underneath the same old sky


But if you're feeling locked up and you wanna get free
'Cause you're always on the hunt, looking for serenity
Some of the times are gonna be rough
But no matter what it brings
Just lean into it, yeah, lean into it

I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Life is not quite the way it seems

I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake

Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven
Forgive me for my sins, let me into Heaven

I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears


Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I’m not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears


Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears

Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears


Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world ’cause I’m cursed
I'm havin’ visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain’t livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears


Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears

Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears


Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come


Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears

God, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears


Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Brokenhearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears


God, please let me in
Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears

I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears


Baby, baby, don't cry
Lord knows I done shed so many tears
Baby, baby, dry your eyes for me

Baby, baby, don't cry 
Baby, baby, dry your eyes for me 

Baby, baby, don't cry 
Baby, baby, dry your eyes for me

Baby, baby

Thriteen letters man ..
We gonna take a little look at the letter that Paul wrote to Titus
And I'm praying that it'll help us see how we can apply
Get a brief overview, and encourage further study


Lets take a look at the letter Paul wrote to Titus
Yea, we 'bout to dive in, I hope you're exited 
Fo sho it's inspired, lets go and apply it
Arrive at conclusions useful to giving
Christ His glories that he deserves
The story is in His word
Titus is all about giving Him glory as his church
From Paul, a bonservant, to Titus, they both fervent
Both serving Christ with their life with the most urgence
Titus was his disciple, he left him in Crete, 
To keep the church in order, his lesson's complete . . 
With rules about elders, fools who need help and
Jews who do fail, stay tuned, see what He tells us
It may seem far from us, just irrelevent text
""Look, what if we not pastors?""  ""ok""
I promise I'll bring it home, let's invest in the text 
I'm about to hit you with the hook, I be addressing it next


Let's be sound in faith
In doctrine, in speech plus deeds
Rep Jesus, the king, let Him lead us, please
Plus we see He told us how we must be
Let's read and trust Jesus who freed us, please
In our faith, in doctrine, in speech plus deeds
Rep Jesus, the King, let Him lead us, please
Plus we see He told us how we must be
Lets read and trust Jesus who freed us, please

Paul told him elders needed to be above reproach
With love and hope and livin' all the stuff He spoke
But then there are those who wear the clothes of elders
But bear the roles of false teachers not speaking truth
So don't select those, correct those men 
And defy'em they tryin', they say they know God
But by they deeds they deny' Him
1:5-9 are the type of cats we wanna pick
For leadership within the church, them other cats we 'pose to fix
But hold up, don't tune me out, I hope that you endure and see
That these things are really marks of a mature believer
We can see that and apply it to our own livin
Instead of sinnin, trippin and livin with no vision
Don't miss the catch too , it addresses me and you
And everybody in the body with some lessons we can use
So read it all and pick the parts that seem to be to you
Live out the sound doctrine, let people see the fruit


Let's be sound in faith
In doctrine, in speech plus deeds
Rep Jesus, the king, let Him lead us, please
Plus we see He told us how we must be
Let's read and trust Jesus who freed us, please
In our faith, in doctrine, in speech plus deeds
Rep Jesus, the King, let Him lead us, please
Plus we see He told us how we must be
Lets read and trust Jesus who freed us, please

Let's be blameless and show consideration for men 
Cause we was just like them before he saved us within 
It wasn't strange we had rage and hatred for men 
Disobedient, diseased and enslaved to our sin 
But He saved us, not on the basis of men
But thanks to His mercy regeneration begins
Poured out His holy spirit, man He placed it within
Justified by grace, thats so amazing for men
If we see this, believe this, we saved and free
We say ""Jesus, lead us to engage in deeds""
Forget foolish controversy and stay in sync
With He who saved us, and raised us, His name is sweet 
I pray that as the body of Christ we model His life
And reference the book of Titus to follow Him right
And we're an accurate reflection as his beautiful church
And let us rep Him with our words and our beautiful works 


Let's be sound in faith
In doctrine, in speech plus deeds
Rep Jesus, the king, let Him lead us, please
Plus we see He told us how we must be
Let's read and trust Jesus who freed us, please
In our faith, in doctrine, in speech plus deeds
Rep Jesus, the King, let Him lead us, please
Plus we see He told us how we must be
Lets read and trust Jesus who freed us, please

Tryna patch people's wounds when yourself still bleeding

Cause it's like time and time again the hurt is getting worse
I feel I'm cursed cause people lied to me so much I can't relax
Every time I'm tryna level up the devil on my back

They brought me out my mind
You know I'm caught beside myself
Pissed off and shit outta luck
Hey, I've thought 'bout puttin' up
I don't have the time, oh, not today



Does somebody got some shit to say?
You know what? Fuck it
Like yada yada
Oh, you know everythang 
But not today

My one and only, closest homie, we've carried on for days
I wanna burn another one down, but I'll go off in a blaze
Yeah, I need to put it out

Darker days were bound to come 
Through eyes of Brenda's only son 
When the dreams become reality 
It's hard to keep a smile off the mug 
Casually talkin' that global warmth
As if the temperature didn't blow out your perm
Our days are numbered, I'd rather count what I earned
My greatest summer was spent on festival runs in Europe
Chicken wings and sushi, I've gotten used to the perks
Narrowly escapin' the holy war on the turf
Turf, yes, Lord


Came a long way from them open mics at Leimert
Forgive me if I walk like I got a chip on my shoulder
Label tried to play me like I didn't do all the work
I found another way through the open gate and my purpose
Now I'm goin' crazy like 
If they forget the dot, I'm chargin' double for the purchase
Lo and behold, my little one
I've been gone for far too long
If I ever take this life for granted, you showed me just how dumb
But the longer I stay, the less I'm paid

Oh I'm blessed and I know I am
God has dealt me a winning hand
A loving woman and a fairy land for me
Oh and I can't believe it half the time
When I look at her in perfect light
Sweet vision every day and night I see


My baby has big green eyes
Brighter than the bluest sky
Softer than an angel flies
Sweeter than a lullaby
And she loves me without design
Her picture never leaves my mind
I don't deserve a love this fine

Oh and I'm never very far away
Even if I'm in another place
Her smile you can't erase from me

For the love of a gentle flower

And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take

Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile

Run, on and on

I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on


Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Prepare for the wrath, a psychopath when this song play
Get iller than Johnny Gill, then rub you the wrong way
Fuck sensitivity I get cruel when you're doing me
Cause none of the rough stuff bitch stop pursuing me

Get sicker than psycho, and won't let the Mic, go

As I go through new beats, I'm running through MC's
Nigga please you dizzy, you can't take me
You stumble through break beats but you'll never fade me
Scared straight cause you hate, when I motivate
You suffer a different fate, with music I mutilate
But some of the super suckers try to stop me
I'm gunning and running the stupid motherfuckers now they jock me
What if I should trip? Or chill and a give fair break
Fuck it they feel the wrath of a motherfucker scared straight

You won't realize your ho's gone

And if I know your address, girls as good as stuck

Fucking with the ginger juice the booze of fucking Hennessy

But still don't let them see me sweat, suckers ain't trying to step

Tell them to bring the noise, and look like they wanna rift

Hitting him with the flurry, I'll bury him if he steps to me

Dropping them like a Mack, and smacking them like a weak bitch

So come out from among them
At a piece, at a part

How the hell can we make money off a nigga like 2Pac
This shit dropped and it got me hot

I should've saw it as a tip off
But you was riding my dick, a little bit and wouldn't get off
So I couldn't see the real mission
'Cause you smile in my face, and when I leave straight dissin'
What my partner told me
""Yo Pac watch yo back everybody ain't ya homie""
Should a saw you as a front and fake

Still pledge allegiance to the game
Pledge my life to the ghetto ways

Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whisper in your ears, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh

Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like

I took a journey to the lowest place on Earth
Got a shovel and I dug into the dirt
Put an apple and some water in my backpack
Well, I don't know if I will ever take a backtrack
Black's the only colour I could see
Then my hand just disappeared in front of me
And when I finally hit a piece of solid stone
Began to wonder if I'll ever make it home


This might be the lowest place on Earth
Gone too deep but, for what it's worth
I have been to the bottom, I've drilled through the rock
And I know how it feels to just fall from the top
Might be the lowest place on Earth


I kept on digging till it turned into a climb
That's when I knew that I had reached the other side
My biceps turned into a solid rock
I found my rhythm and I knew I couldn't stop
When the light began to leak into the cave
I cried because I knew I had been saved


This might be the lowest place on Earth
Gone too deep but, for what it's worth
I have been to the bottom, I've drilled through the rock
And I know how it feels to just fall from the top
Might be the lowest place on Earth


Digging and digging till I see the Sun
I dig the hole that I must overcome
Climbing and climbing till I make it out
Pulling my body onto solid ground


Might be the lowest place on Earth
Gone too deep but, for what it's worth
I have been to the bottom, I've drilled through the rock
And I know how it feels to free fall from the top
Might be the lowest place on Earth

I stumbled on a bunch of junk of mine
In a shoebox the other night
In between cleaning up piles of messes
That I've made of my life
Ticket stubs, love poems and old letters
I dumped them all out on the bed
Found a homemade birthday card from my mom
And this is what it said
Yeah, this is what it said

They're the ones that mean the most
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father

And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on

I opened up my grandpa's pocket knife
And I was back to his back porch
It was summertime, I was turning nine
He said you want that knife, it's yours
I remember running off in the yard
Carved my name in every tree
I haven't held it since he passed away
Man it meant the world to me
Because he meant the world to me

"Giving in to love
And sharing my time
Letting someone into my misery
I told it all step by step

How I landed on the island
And how I swim across the sea
And it crosses my mind
That I may awake to a knife in me

No more breath in my hair or ladies underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem
Heartfelt last line reading

There is no more mystery
Is it going to happen, my love?
There is no more mystery
Is it going to happen, my love?

""It's all in my head"", she said, ""Morning after nightmare""
""You're building a wall"", she said, ""Higher than the both of us
So try living life instead of hiding in the bedroom
Show me a smile and I'll promise not to leave you""

It happened under a rainy cloud
Passing through the dark South
We went into a big house
And slept in a small bed

I didn't know you then
As well as you of me
We talked of our sad lives
And we went on separately

And we went on separately
I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards
Those long forgotten high school fears

""It's all in my head"", I said
Banging on the piano
I've not been so alone
I thought, since kicking in the womb

I drank so much tea
I wrote my letters in kanji
Around the block I walked and walked
Pretending you were with me

Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends
Like birthdays and old friends, we forget
That this flesh blood and bone is human
Trading phone lines for airlines
Unwilling to face
That love is found on the inside
Not the outside

And like a medicine bottle
In the cabinet, I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle
In my hand I will hold you

And swallow you slowly
As to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight
I do not want to lose

The thrill that it gives me
To look out from my window
And scowl at the houses
From my world in the bedroom

It's all in his head, she read
In a girlfriend's self-help book
It's all his own making
A war with himself

Like two sides of a wall
That separates two countries
He shuts out the world he once knew
To love you

Not wanting to die out here
Without you
Not wanting to die out here
Without you

It's hard to describe
You're like nothing I've ever known in my life
Kindness flowing from down deep inside your eyes
So selfless and complete
A beauty in and out
All around you not a single cloud
Like the rain just stops before it hits the ground
And puddles at your feet


You're an angel
I know heaven wonders where you are
Like you fell off some ol' shining star
Right into my heart
An angel
When I'm with you I feel like a king
Just like out of some old movie scene
An angel, everything but the wings


Looking at you
It's hard to believe that you could feel the way I do
Never thought I'd find so much love we fall into
Or perfect or true
So never go away
If heaven calls you back just ask if you can stay
I'd never find someone to ever take your place
You know they only made a few

Cannot categorize the nature of this sickness
A miracle that you're alive
Stuck to the roof of my mouth with a staple
Remember last April when we saw U.S. Maple?
Somehow, the singer showed the Fireside exactly how I feel


And we say goodbye and go underground
Or up towards the sky, up in smoke, burnt down to size
At least we're still friends
At least we're still alive


Take your wings outside, no use for them in here
Bad luck to open inside
Work like umbrellas, like a broken mirror
It's getting clearer, the end is closer
Than ever before and you'll want nothing more
When your head hits the floor and you're lost in the darkness


And we say goodbye and go underground
Or up towards the sky, up in smoke, burnt down to size
At least we're still friends
At least we're still alive

Send my goonie to pull up on you, like Suge with the pistol
He might hit you and then spin your block wit your friend too
If you pull up on me and you movin' wild then it’s lit
Know it's always on me, even when I sleep, it's under the pillow
They been plottin' on me since I was eighteen wearin' Kenzo
Ain't rentin' no jeans, Mike Amiri got me official

They heard the call from the evil vault
And raised their swords in the air
Kings and Queens, the evil dreams
Their hearts full of steel and despair


Rain and thunder
The lightning strikes the earth
And a thousand warriors
They lived and died by the sword


On the run
Only the strong will survive
Get on down
Can't escape from the hideaway
On the run
Only the strong will survive
On the wings of no return
Will they ever learn

Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby


And I don't even know his last name

It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know his last name
Woo!


We left the club, right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

Not too modest and not a lot of pride

Used to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide

If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter 
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast
Cause I don't wanna see 'em, start bucking
Throwing chairs in the air while you be ducking

Staring down on the city street

Where I can be happy and just be me
Home, where the warm winds blowing
And the rivers flowing along

And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome

Seen a lot of those dreams come true
I've had good luck

Back to the time when I was a kid
To the sound of the crickets and the katydids
It's called

Home
On the front porch swinging and fern pots hanging
Home
With the church bells ringing and voices singing
Old songs that's in my mind like a stitch in time
Where the tea is sweet and the love's complete
For me, I wanna go

I often think about where I have been
Where I am going and lots about when I think about
Home

Where the soul find comfort
And the heart find pleasure
Home

Where the depths of love is hard to measure it's
Home

I hear you callin'
I hear you callin'

I'll never be lost
As long as I know there's a place like that
Where I can go
Where I can restore my weary soul
On the mountain slopes of the south ""Blue Smoke""
Of home home sweet home

Home, back to the hills of the Whip-poor-wills
Home, with the fireflies blinking
And the night stars twinklin'
Home, honeysuckle vine and muscadine wine at
Home, where the ginsing glows and the chevy goes-a
Home, with family and friends and joy that never ends

Bad to the bone
Always ready to go
Everybody wants to wear the crown

But when I'm gone you'll remember my name

You're pushin' your luck and that's dangerous

You never met a motherfucker quite like me

Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gained, truth be told
But I am not the enemy
It isn't me, the enemy


But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?


Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
And bury me beside you
I have no hope in solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below


But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?

This old guitar taught me to sing a love song
Showed me how to laugh and how to cry
Introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
Helped me make it through some lonely nights
What a friend to have on a cold lonely night


This old guitar gave me my sweet, sweet baby
Opened up his eyes and ears to me
Brought us close together
And I guess it broke his heart
It opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be


This old guitar gave me my life, my living
All the things you know I love to do
Serenade the stars that shine
From a sunny mountain side
Most of all, to sing my songs for you
I love to sing my songs for you
Yes I do, I love to sing my songs for you

He was slaughtering a lamb
I accused him there
With his tortured lamb
He said, ""Listen to me, child
I am what I am
And you, you are my only son.""

Well, I found a silver needle
I put it into my arm
It did some good
Did some harm
But the nights were cold
And it almost kept me warm
How come the night is long?

I saw some flowers growing up
Where that lamb fell down
Was I supposed to praise my Lord
Make some kind of joyful sound?
He said, ""Listen, listen to me now
I go round and round
And you, you are my only child.""

Towing the line
I watched the host drink all the wine
And now she rambles
Through the who's and who have not's

The old man is a painter
Of tired sea scapes
Tilted adventures
And so my mind wanders
Picking at the table to cure the rot

Like a bird in a world with no trees
You were hung up there in your disbelief
I know I'm a hard rock to drag around


Love is in the early mornings
In the shadows under the trees
Not in the cuckolded ashes floating down from the rookery

Down here I'll crow for you, you crow for me
Down here I'll crow for you, you crow for me


Towing the line
I watched the host drink all the wine
And now I’m purring
For a drop of anything
Throwing stones at your window
You turn to me as if it’s simple
Why can’t you be like the blackbird
And sing
I say I’m the westerlies in Ireland
So decadent and violent
Can’t you see I’m a forager
Clawing at the bedrock


Love is in the early mornings
In the shadows under the trees
Not in the cuckolded ashes
Floating down from the rookery

Some make the bet some ponder it yet
Some pass, some raise, some call


Some play it smart

Gotta get out
Gotta get outside
I gotta get outside of my mind before I rip it out


I'm on a drive
I'm on a night drive
I gotta take a little trip, get twisted
And ride it out


Always after hours
I'm runnin' red lights
Always after hours
Late night, power
I feel it at the wheel

Never give an inch
That's what I say, son
When it's too tough for everybody else
Hell, it's just right for me
Now, my lips are bleeding
From the selfish things that I've done
And my heart it lies at the bottom of the ocean

Sometimes a great notion


Wanted to make love to my girl
In the backseat of my car
So, I took her to the drive-in picture show
So, I filled her up with
Lies and a strong love potion
And I'm sittin' here watching the movie alone

Sometimes a great notion




Sometimes the best-made plans
Have been known to go astray
So, you better put your seat belt on
Just like your worst headache
Well, a bad day don't go away
And, you hit the ground running against your emotions

Sometimes a great notion
Sometimes a great notion

"Miss me
Don't you miss someone to hold you, now in the end?
And kiss me
And tell me I'm your lil' girl again

Daddy, when you left, did you remove yourself
From every sweet remembrance of me?
I'm always missing you, I hope you miss me too
And everything we were and still could be

Miss little things like walking in the park
Miss summer nights with fireflies in the jar
Big memories of you playing your guitar
Miss all of this, it's true, but mostly I miss you
'Cause no one else could ever take your place

And momma, don't you miss that home is all about
And all the drama caused by the anger you keep acting out?
Why can't you both just see, you didn't divorce me?
Forgive, forget and try to get along
I miss us being close, I love and miss you both
Don't miss the plea I've written in my song

Your little miss is missing out on you
And you're both missing out on so much too
Put pride aside and do what you should do
Don't make me have to choose
'Cause I love the both of you
Just let resentment go, and think of me

You've torn my world apart, and it breaks my little heart
Can't you see me? And see me missing you?
Oooh, I miss you, I miss you, miss me!
Miss me! I miss you. Miss me!

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever


Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah


Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California

Leather black and eyes of blue 
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger


So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

The apple of your eye
The rotten core inside
We are all prisoners
Things couldn't get much worse

You know your end is near

Intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life

You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin motherfuckers aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies


So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facing
We must be based on nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shakin
I'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin yo souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme I wrote
Takin off my coat, clearing my throat


I got my mind made up, come on... 
Get in get in too 
Let it ride  tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on...
Get in get in too
Let it ride... tonight's tha night


Well I comes through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin, raw maniacal villian
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
Why is that?  Cuz smilin faces decieve
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat


Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, stickin up *Jews* wit German *lugers*
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast


Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
To bust til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel


I set the mic in flames, my name's INS the Rebel
Murder one style, smash piles straight to pebbles
Mental terrorist, specialist at this
Menacing lyricst, leave crews defenseless
Can't design landmines, lick off like nines
To paralyze everything, ears ring like doorknobs
Heads start to turn like police who pass
Hear the blast, my crew bust through like tear gas
Fuck a mask, we laced in place like the marshall
Sparkle, like live but harder than tarvue
Wreck this rhyme, start relentless, roughest
And fuck up the party for you paying motherfuckers
Once I commence for you ladies and gents
I kick rhymes, sharper than barbwire fence
The live and direct, from Killah Hill Project
Staten Island, New York, you can't help but to hawk
Lay it on your dental, that's if you want it hostile
Sounds so underground I write my rhymes on fossil
Dudes like this, force me to get you open
Lyrically wet you open, until you soaking

It's safe to say that no one is waiting for you
To draw your lifeline, and
One million voices are begging you to follow the lines
And you keep on thinking that
We're all falling down or wasting our time
If we're chasing our childhood dreams
Where's the glory?
If there's nothing to see!


There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight
But you gave up countless times
There's no hope in your mind
No dream of a lifetime
Only reasons to turn back


You focus now on the comfort of your fate
This fragile world that keeps you in this state
You just look back on these fading memories
Sitting alone, while hope keeps me singing
We're not falling down or wasting our time
As we're chasing our childhood dreams
Here's the glory!


There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight
But you gave up countless times
There's no hope in your mind
No dream of a lifetime
Only reasons to turn back


My words ring in your head each and every day
We're still oceans apart and miles away
Now, you'd better forget what you leave behind
This, could be your last chance to make up your mind!
I can't get over it!


It's time, for you to trust, in yourself!
Drop your doubts!


There's not a storm in sight
There's nothing we can't fight
But you gave up countless times
There's no hope in your mind
No dream of a lifetime
Only reasons, to turn back!

I'm too afraid to grow up, I pray to God I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers could hear my prayers

When my back against the wall, I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be going hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until something happen, I'm answering to God

Cuz the nights we was ill, y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh now my money change drastic, The coupe do gymnastic
The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic, probably with a bad bitch
Slash actress soon we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic, all of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish, this got to be magic


If I should die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Please rejoice this song I sing
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace

I dream that, um, I was off in a forest somewhere--I don't know where, but somewhere--and I was sitting on top of this huge tree
And I don't know how I got up there, like
That tree way over there that's just a little tiny twig--I was just sitting on it and I was afraid to move and...I moved and the tree just bent with me--that was weird...


Your love is like a building
Pushing up towards the sky
And I just wanna climb your tower
To your dress like apple pie


Oh I love you on a Tuesday
Oh I love you on a Tuesday moon
Vegetable hand on my perfume


I am changing colors daily
Jumping to my postbox
While everything's exploding, baby
In your dress I'll sleep a while


Oh it's flying toward some Tuesday
Oh it's flying toward some Tuesday moon


Into the air like a balloon
She's taking scissors to her wing
It's shrinking diesel through my room
With no arms and legs, can you dig?
Can you dig it?


Your love is like a drunken stupor
Falling into push paper holes
Into my insides I scoop her
Burning up her real time flows


Oh I love you on a Tuesday
Oh I love you on a Tuesday moon
Vegetable hand on my perfume
Vegetable hand on my perfume
Vegetable hand on my perfume

"A mongoose can smile at a cobra
But that cobra will always be a snake
Diamante can shine like a diamond
But you know, like I know
That rock will be fake
It's the real thing

Nothing but the real thing

You can xerox the Mona Lisa
Deadpan Da Vinci in every detail
Might beat customs on a home-made visa
But false papers
Only gets you in jail

Nothing but the real thing
It's real
Life wears a smile on its face
But it comes with a sting in its tail
Make believe fables have their place
But only a fool. Only a fool
Believes fairy tales
I heard all the lies that they tell ya
""Phone me baby. The cheque's in the mail""
Well as fantasy. It may please ya
As the real thing
It does nothing but fail
It's the real thing

"They say the time has come for us to start again
I believe that's true
They say the time has come for us to make amends
And I believe that too
Why tell me why?
Is it all so hard to find?

For a perfect world
Where children are laughing
Lovers romancing
Time stands still
A perfect world
There's nothing to cry for
No on to die for
Wonderful
In a perfect world

Our father's father says that things were better than
How easy they forget
On every page in every book of history a thousand tears were shed
There's hope in our hearts and love in our eyes
Day after day I keep searching
Why tell me why
Is it all so hard to find?
I pray each day

For a perfect world...

Show me the way I'm to understand
That you prove to myself that I'm a man
And you love, but you can't look from above

Travel cross the seven seas to be with you
Passion and desire will see me through
The road that I must travel will wind and curl
You're all I ever needed in a perfect world

The lord of the twilight disturbing my brain
Another night of slavery will drive me insane

A soldier's oath, freedom of death

Word is bond, bond is life

Stayin' true to myself, that's how I keep it real

If I fail then I'll rise
Like a phoenix before yo eyes
Out the ashes and from the dirt
Report for duty and put in work
Eternal life, an iron will
Man sharpens man, steel sharpens steel
The hate you gave, we turn to love
Rest in peace, one thug one love


We can't be stopped if we don't give up
Even though they hold us back we still find ways to come up
A lot of people make promises with no plans to keep 'em
But me, no matter what I'm ridin' 'til I get my freedom
If I fail, then it's only a challenge to go harder
Don't want to be no martyr so I adapt to things smarter
It's death before dishonor
And I put that on my son and my momma
And don't take it as a threat, that's a promise

If in my quest to achieve my goals
I stumble or crumble or even lose my soul
Those that knew me would easily co-sign
That there was never a life as hard as mine
No father, no money, no chance, no guide
I only follow my voice inside
If it guides me wrong and I do not win
I'll learn from mistakes and try to achieve again


Dedicated to the youth, the truth is the seed
The stronger the root, the stronger the tree
If we eat from the fruit, the stronger we be
If we do it today, tomorrow we free

Shit half the times we fought and caused trouble
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin' bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin' wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin' cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin' me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin' deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin' from the future, escapin' in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz


Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz

All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign

Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy you's a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer
Ain't tryin' to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, cause we ain't scared
M.O.B., 'til I die, when we ride niggas disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
For leakin' information to the feds
The burnin' bed was the tellin' sign
Two hired guns bustin' everyone, yellin' everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
Bleedin' like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz

Let me get to the other side with my road dogz

Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine


Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin'
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin'
See me in physical form, my niggas swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin' jealous niggas 'til they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
And send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin' for fake niggas, observe and shake niggas
The only way to see six figures, is break niggas
Me and Mussolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi,homicide ask us why
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on ..

What is this land America so many travel there
I'm going now while I'm still young my darling meet me there
Wish me luck my lovely I'll send for you when I can
And we'll make our home in the American land
Over there all the woman wear silk and satin to their knees
And children dear, the sweets, I hear, are growing on the trees
Gold comes rushing out the rivers straight into your hands
When you make your home in the American Land


There's diamonds in the sidewalk the's gutters lined in song
Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who will make his home in the American Land


I docked at Ellis Island in a city of light and spires
She met me in the valley of red-hot steel and fire
We made the steel that built the cities with our sweat and two hands
And we made our home in the American Land


There's diamonds in the sidewalk the's gutters lined in song
Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who will make his home in the American Land


The McNicholas, the Polanski's, the Smiths, Zerillis, too
The Blacks, the Irish, Italians, the Germans and the Jews
Come across the water a thousand miles from home
With nothing in their bellies but the fire down below
They died building the railroads worked to bones and skin
They died in the fields and factories names scattered in the wind
They died to get here a hundred years ago they're still dying now
The hands that built the country were always trying to keep down

Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man

"I got my back to the sun ’cause the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
You can’t turn back—you can’t come back, sometimes we push too far
One day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see where we are

Sugar Baby get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ’em bad enough
I’m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she’s not really my aunt
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can’t

Sugar Baby get on down the line
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now

The ladies down in Darktown, they’re doing the Darktown Strut
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
There ain’t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love’s not an evil thing

Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now

Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse

Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done
Just as sure as we’re living, just as sure as you’re born
Look up, look up—seek your Maker—’fore Gabriel blows his horn

Sugar Baby, get on down the line
You ain’t got no sense, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

Danger times, danger times, danger times, danger times
Danger times, danger times, danger times, danger times


It's on, a dead body found wrapped in the carpet
A healthy pretty baby found cryin' in the garbage
Walk your dog, she pees on the sidewalk
No movies no clubs, 'cause you're bound to get caught
In the mix, runnin' for your life, time to get home
See somebody fool caught a straight to the dome
For no reason, death is still the season
Everybody's scared, leave the body bleedin'
People runnin' frantic, 'cause the shots are still ringin'
These damn thugs, just won't stop the gun slingin'
Havin' fun in these days, you gotta wear a vest
1-2-5 in the summer's like the Wild West
Something jump off a nigga cap, everybody cap
Worst about it is every fuckin' body's strapped
All you can do is cross your fingers and hope you're lucky
I see you used ta wear a laugh or grab her asses chokin'
But if I'm ok when the shots stop, not layin' in blood
Hop in my ride, tryin' to slide with these scared thugs
Dangerous times, dangerous days, dangerous nights
Everywhere we go the danger's never out of sight
Junior high school in '86 and '87
They had 38's and '94 is Mack 11's
What the hell is goin' on God? Pass the indo
What the hell they killin' over Nintendo?
I think the world is endin', and AIDS is the plague
So you can die later if you don't die today
Mothers cryin', can't understand it
Their kids gone and even reach a man yet
I try to free the hip hop when I rapping lines
But every time I try, it ends up being crime time
Go to school, go to the movies, go to the club, go to the store
Turn on the news, it's like were livin' in a war
No one to trust, the cops are the fuckin' crooks
In these days, they ain't goin' by the books
Proceed with caution, if you're not you're lost
In these fucked up times they have no remorse in
Get twisted, the last thing on your mind
You got caught kid, livin' in these danger times


It's that reality 
It's that reality 
It's that reality 
It's that reality 


Yo I'm ridin' through the back streets
Bumpin' black beats, stop where the niggas sellin' crack be
Say what up to my neighbourhood dealers
Niggas rollin' cee-lo, local car stealers
Narcs cruisin' by, they wanna lock us on the way
No eye contact, we wanna lead them astray
But the niggas in the backseat lookin' like a snitch though
Cops hookin' up, lookin' like a little bitch yo
So you know I'm back dro
Can't get caught in the mix
By these fake trouble cops and they crooked ass tricks
And uh, hold up yo, niggas rollin' up, for what?
I don't know, but they was busters so I gives a fuck
Pop a man in his fuckin' dome had to yank for chrome
I forgot it, I was lurkin' in the red zone
When the smoke cleared, I see my man was dead
And the cops on the corner, then a muthafucka fled the scene
It's gotta be a dream yo I'm buggin'
I stood up the scene, lookin' mean mad muggin' muthafucka
That I be from the streets
For the first thing jump, I got my hand on my heat
Yo it's danger time


It's that reality 
It's that reality  
It's that reality 
It's that reality 


Yo, will I, live or die?
I don't know 'cause it's stranger times
I'm too high to read the muthafuckin' danger signs
Niggas all on my phone talkin' major shit
And you mad 'cause I don't wanna page you, bitch
Now quit being quick to flip
My niggas dyin' over small time triflin' shit
So I ain't got time for these you know whats
On the nuts of a nigga makin' major bucks
I'm more lost, runnin' from the police force
New York's finest, comin' right behind us
Mind flippin' off the Moet that a nigga's sippin'
Open fire on them bitches if they get to trippin'
Mob on the scene with the Squad from Queens
Drinkin' Hennessy, muthafuckin' cops are green
Plus the mini 14 for the punks wit' funk
Drop the trunk on them silly bitches, blast them punks

I been to ICU once, I ain't going again
First Z got murked then Roy got murked
And homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?
I smell something fishy, man, it might be a rat
Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray off Suzuki's, eleven hundred cc's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC
In the hood they identify niggas by their cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I'll send Yayo to dump 30 shots on your block
You should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say get it done
I'll make you wet niggas if you 'round me son

When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggas
Get close enough to smack then I'll clap ya nigga
Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with MACs to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call: ""Fifty what up?""
""They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up""
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy
Front on me you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy
Cousin Twin shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail
Pop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo'
The shells from Twin's fo'-fo' blew the hinge off her door
Without that check every month how she going to pay for the crib?
Man, social service finna come and take them kids


I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven


Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference
In AA they make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you a case act
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens
But when we come home that don't mean we going to fucking be friends
The shells pass your head close enough to hear them whistle
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol
In the hood niggas running 'round acting crazy
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his and it might be yours
Because them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers
You can have them on their back or on all fours
You ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit
Because I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit

When you start to take a look within
Do you feel at ease with what you see
Do you think you can have peace of mind
And have self belief or be satisfied


Do you think you even like yourself
Or really think you could be someone else
Is there something that you'd rather be
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see


All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away


Feel the paranoia creeping in
Like a cancer eating at the skin
Do you feel you've lost your self-esteem
And your self respect, what can you expect


All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away
All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away


All my life I've run astray
Let my faith  slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away




Are you scared to look inside your mind
Are you worried just at what you'll find
Do you really want to face the truth
Does it matter now, what have you got to lose


Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think
Are you strong enough to release the guilt


All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away


All my life I've run astray
Let my faith  slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away

Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame

Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame


Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
I know, death follows me, but I'll murder him first
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
I'm the first one to want him blasted
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit 
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me

For the fame  The notoriety
To be well-known  in this society
To have everybody eyeing me
'Cause when I rise up my block mane, my cost is to floss
I'm making up for all the times, that I floss to be lost 
I scream,  'til I was lost forever, nobody came 
So on this day forth, I'ma die for the fortune and fame 
Been on my name  where were all these years that I walk this earth
Went for all mine  especially been cautious since birth
Remain the same, since the day I came , will never change
Even though I live my life hellishly  for all this fame 


Block fronters shoot slugs we throw 'em back like hardballs
Without the gloves
No love for these fake desperadoes and thugs 
I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts sipping Henny
Drunk nights And high days
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways
A life on the run 
Full of common blunts unconditionally married to my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny for needs and ones desires
Be pulling all my cabbage like pliers
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher
Than fortune and fame

Some niggas be players up in the game five years
Some niggas be making one platinum album
Then be gettin' disrespecting O.G. peers

With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well

And the mailbox is locked

To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine

And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette”

Grandpa died last week
And now he’s buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked

And shot it full of holes

When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest

I hope you’re satisfied”

Aw, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, “Jump right in”
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time

Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
’Neath her Panamanian moon
And I say, “Aw come on now
You know ya' know about my debutante”
And she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want”

Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice

Oh, Mama, is this really the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

And I don't pretend to know what you know

"Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky

What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you

What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Then please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too

Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home

What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear

What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
If you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, ind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame

And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there

I will bury you in time
When the sea begins to slide
Into this hole where I am smiling on your shoulder
You have buried my beliefs
Where all you sisters sleep
That their scent the purity will make
When the youth is over
Frozen in some lost October


And I am breathing into you
It makes your features move
And they shimmer like balloons that fly above the ocean
All the world is waiting here
You can hear the children cheer
But they'll need you when you're near
The brink of complete implosion
Crown your king when your life is broken
Everything you are I'm tearing through
Everything you want I'm wanting too
I gave you more than I thought I could ever do
And I will never break you


And if I was the king of all the kids
You'd you hear me singing in my spit
But all you would hear is the shit inside my burnt emotions
I will bury you in time
When the sea begins to slide
Into this hole where you and I will sing our songs unbroken
As the water starts it's choking

Dear momma's boy, I know you've had your butt licked by your mother
I know you've enjoyed all that attention from her
And every woman graced with your presence after
Dear narcissus boy, I know you've never really apologized for anything
I know you've never really taken responsibility
I know you've never really listened to a woman
Dear me-show boy I know you're not really into conflict resolution
Or seeing both sides of every equation
Or having an uninterrupted conversation


And any talk of healthiness
And any talk of connectedness
And any talk of resolving this
Leaves you running for the door



Dear egotist boy, you've never really had to suffer any consequence
You've never stayed with anyone longer than ten minutes
You'd never understand anyone showing resistance
Dear popular boy I know you're used to getting everything so easily
A stranger to the concept of reciprocity
People honor boys like you in this society


And any talk of selflessness
And any talk of working at this
And any talk of being of service
Leaves you running for the door

You go back to the women who will dance the dance
You go back to your friends who will lick your ass
You go back to ignoring all the rest of us
You go back to the center of your universe


Dear self centered boy, I don't know why I still feel affected by you
I've never lasted very long with someone like you
I never did although I have to admit I wanted to
Dear magnetic boy you've never been with anyone who doesn't take your shit
You've never been with anyone who's dared to call you on it
I wonder how you'd be if someone were to call you on it


And any talk of willingness
And any talk of both feet in
And any talk of commitment
Leaves you running for the door

You go back to the women who will dance the dance
You go back to your friends who will lick your ass
You go back to being so oblivious
You go back to the center of the universe

Ha ha - said what you saying boy?


See, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
See me, I never ever ever run

Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world

You push me I'mma motherfucking trip

I'm the last one, you know the last don
She know she wanna come, bitch, bring your ass on




See, I come from the Southside where niggas is outside
Right now with the rubber grips
Niggas say they gon' see me to hit 'em on G.P
Then I bless 'em with the chains full of bricks
When you come from where I'm from you come from the bottom
They ain't supposed to get this rich
So the Fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like Fat Cat
Now I'm thinking ""man, ain't this a bitch?""

Four o'clock in the afternoon
And I didn't feel like very much
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy
Where is your famous golden touch?""
I thought you knew where
All of the elephants lie down
I thought you were the crown prince
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town
Just take a look at your body now
There's nothing much to save
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave.""
Now if you can manage to get
Your trembling fingers to behave
Why don't you try unwrapping
A stainless steel razor blade?


That's right, it's come to this
Yes it's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down
Wasn't it a strange way down?


There's no hot water
And the cold is running thin
Well, what do you expect from
The kind of places you've been living in?
Don't drink from that cup
It's all caked and cracked along the rim
That's not the electric light, my friend
That is your vision growing dim
Cover up your face with soap, there
Now you're Santa Claus
And you've got a gift for anyone
Who will give you his applause
I thought you were a racing man
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace
That's a funeral in the mirror
And it's stopping at your face




Once there was a path
And a girl with chestnut hair
And you passed the summers
Picking all of the berries that grew there
There were times she was a woman
Oh, there were times she was just a child
And you held her in the shadows
Where the raspberries grow wild
And you climbed the twilight mountains
And you sang about the view
And everywhere that you wandered
Love seemed to go along with you
That's a hard one to remember
Yes it makes you clench your fist
And then the veins stand out like highways
All along your wrist


And yes it


You can still find a job
Go out and talk to a friend
On the back of every magazine
There are those coupons you can send
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians
They will give you back your hope
You can find your love with diagrams
On a plain brown envelope
But you've used up all your coupons
Except the one that seems
To be written on your wrist
Along with several thousand dreams
Now Santa Claus comes forward
That's a razor in his mit
And he puts on his dark glasses
And he shows you where to hit
And then the cameras pan
The stand in stunt man
Dress rehearsal rag
It's just the dress rehearsal rag
You know this dress rehearsal rag
It's just a dress rehearsal rag

He met her in the fall of '93 in the hills of Tennessee
She was barely 17, he was tall and strong and lean
They were deep in love by June
Hand in hand beneath that moon


And she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night until dawn
On a hillside all alone


They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song


She married in her mama's wedding gown
Bought a house and settled down
He worked driving all around
All at large from town to town
And he'd come home every night
And she'd be waiting in the front porch light






They couldn't tell him what was wrong
But they just didn't know
It wasn't very long until Jesus called her home
And he got down on his knees
Said, ""God, don't take my love from me""






Now he lives there all alone
In the house that they call home
In his heart there lies a void 
From the absence of her voice
And he lays down every night
Dreams about that front porch light






Little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song

When you walk in the bar
And you’re dressed like a star
Rocking your F-Me-Pumps
And a man notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can’t tell who he’s looking to
Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that’s your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
Cause your dream in life
Is to be a foot-baller’s wife


You don’t like play-ers
That’s what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire
You don’t like ball-ers
They don’t do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or tall-er


You’re more than a fan
Looking for a man
But you end up with one night stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning you’re vexed
He’s on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don’t be too upset
If they call you a ""sket""
Cause like the news every day you get pressed


You don’t like play-ers
That’s what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire
All them big ball-ers
Don’t do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or tall-er


You can’t sit down right
Because your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it’s ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Mi-am-i
Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met some-bod-y
And spent the night getting caned
Without girls like you there’d be no fun
We’d go to the club and not see any-one
Without girls like you there’s no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don’t be mad at me
Cause your pushing 30
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps

You know that I would break the truth

Savour your words, I won't ever waste them
Look in your eyes and know just what you meant
So lie to me, just lie to me

Well, tell me what I want, want, want

I can't believe you love me
After all the things I've done
I think I've been the devil
Since the day that I turned one

Like when I stole your money
Just to buy a pack of gum
I know it wasn't funny
Can't believe I was so dumb

Pre-chorus:
I blame it on my age
But even now, i'm not so young
I'm still stuck in my ways
I can't believe what I've become

Somehow, you feel the same
I guess that's motherly love
Motherly love

Wish I could find the piece in me
To see the good things that you see
It's not that easy

Chorus:
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say

And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me

If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes

Verse 2:
I can't believe you love me
After all the things I did
Like when I said I hated you when we were in Madrid
Like when I didn't answer you cause I was on the road
But you cooked my favorite dinner for me right when I get home

Pre-chorus:
I blame it on my stress
Cause I've been feeling so high strung
I'm looking for excuses
And I know that isn't one

Somehow, you feel the same
I guess that's motherly love
Motherly love

Wish I could find the piece in me
To see the good things that you see
It's not that easy

Chorus:
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say

And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me

Outro:
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes

But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say

My friends from high school
Married their high school boyfriends
Moved into houses in the same ZIP codes
Where their parents live
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow
I hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling
Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel


I've been a long time gone now
Maybe someday, someday I'm going to settle down
But I've always found my way somehow
By taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way

I met the queen of whatever
Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow

Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm getting it back on the road now
But I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around

Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself
I opened my mouth and I heard myself
It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
Guess I could have made it easier on myself

The copper shades of a morning
Distant lights beckon and fade
Unwritten songs of another day

I fear that you would never be
Every song in the world for me
I took your hand, led you astray
You cursed the worlds I longed to save
To save
To save

Is heaven to you a perfect place?
The look of sorrow on a sufferer's face?
A field of lives to sow and reap
That some of us will never see

Why is it I don't feel the same?
Are my longings to be blamed
For not seeing heaven like you would see
Why is a song a world for me?
For me

I get in from work at 2 A.M
And sit down with a beer
Turn on late night TV and
Then I wonder why I am here


It's meaningless and trivial
And it washes over me
And once again I wonder
Is this all there is for me


Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own


Life seems so pathetic
I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed
These walls that fall in on my mind


Hold on for something better
That just drags you through the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on and
Try to take the hurt?








Alone again
Alone again
I'm here on my own

There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me the smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you
So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue skies, how I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love
So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Now if there's a cloud up above us
Come on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
And give relief from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Can't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet


Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let me visit out there
In that new promised land


Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a loving state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never knowin' what love's about

Then you can blow now if you want to, I'm through

And every night I can't help reaching out for more

The day rolls in, the night rolls out
Desire rules without a doubt
The heart beats fast, you salivate
And when you come it won't be late
I guess by now you got the score
A little taste you want it more
From San Anton to Marrakesh
Yeah when the night comes
Every body's got to have FLESH

You got me all soaking wet
FLESH - the only thing that's worth the sweat
From the day that Eve did Adam
Down to Romeo and Juliette
Everybody gotta have

The prince of lust has met his match
The witch has brewed her baddest batch
His sword is sharp and hard as stone
Her cauldron begs for one more bone
And so my love, this story's told
From modern times to days of old
From Boston Mass to Bangladesh
Yeah, when the night comes
Everybody got to have FLESH

It's got me all soaking wet
FLESH - the only thing that's worth the sweat, yeah
From the Mississippi River
To the highest mountain in Tibet
Everybody gotta have

FLESH - you got me all soaking wet
FLESH - the only thing that's worth the sweat

Most three dangerous words in the whole fucking music bidness

Snoop Dogg, Dat Nigga Daz and 2Pac
Death Row's finest
Westside trick


Three words to make a mu'fucka heart burst
I rip the verse worse, nigga when I start to curse
Picture a black hearse, adversaries buried in they Sunday best
He blinked, died in the dark, my guns sprayed his chest
But will I die nigga? We all die, so until I die
Why must I ride on my enemies until they fry
Father forgive them, 'cause they not knowin'
My Glock cocked niggas drop, when my shots flowin'
My definition of a thug nigga
A multi-millionaire, started as a drug dealer
I love niggas
Open fire when I blast at ya
Everybody dies, bad boy massacre, I laugh at ya
Holla my name, I reappear like a Genie
No one, no man alive can see me
Mothafuckas makin' problems, but they get what they deserve
Get destroyed, with these three words, mu'fuckas know


To be a high rolla, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And don't trip to get a chip off my nigga shoulder
Many dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney
Or Bogey for Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follower, man, I'm a general
So when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger

And I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone
Spittin' three words up in lightning
As long as I'm bouncin' with this I know you likin' this
Fo' sho though, you can't take my photo
I'm throwing that DPG, layin' lowkey in a grey fo-do
Get pushed around town in the back of a car
Double R from the dirt to the stars


Fuck the world, feel the fury of the chosen man
Thug nigga, 10 millimeter close in hand
Put 'em in my range, aim nigga take fire
Watch 'em die, should've never fucked around when it's time to ride
Ridin' low, down a one way, watch for gun play
I hope we find true peace one day
Nobody cry when my dog died, set 'em straight
AK-Automatically, retaliate


Can I ride through, them niggas tried to
Ha, tick tock, I got the Glock, we shock
The game with the realism
Thug Life, Dogg Pound about to get with 'em
'Cause we hit 'em with the west coast gangsta shit
'Cause that's all we know and that's all we spit

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none


Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth


Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now, grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding, corrosive subsiding
That withered and waned till the world seemed all drained fills the bay

"Fire is my method for destruction
Leaving charred wreckage from my latest eruption
Unpredictable, my erratic demeanor
Bobbing and weaving as my mind gets leaner
Though I’m trippin on legs that stumble but I don’t fall down
You know I’m singing out things you mumble from a lack of resound
Pissed off mist lifts to honesty
Now come down motherfucker with your philosophy

I’m at ease when I feel there’s a breeze
Give me a little please

So are you ready for your lesson blood?
Democratic non erratic Socratic method
We’ll take away the pain
We’ll pacify the bullshit built up in your brain
In times of change or the same old things
As you maintain or rearrange

Can’t nobody do it like 311
Fuckin’ up competition cuz there really is none
Steppin on your game from the first floor up tore up
Electricity we store it up
Can’t nobody do it like 311
Break it down, what it is, dedication
Sending out gratitude like we laid it out on Down
Throw down fuck the bullshit we’re still the sound

Wild and lost speed mad
A long way from sad
Lookin’ good like you should you’re bad
An itinerant dimension mystic is your spirit see
Like color absolute bodiless indeed
Casual kindred spirit past
All the obstacles you’re dealin’ with at last
The nasdaq, two puppies, baby needs, new shoes
Car alarms, your rent, wedding bells, the blues

The tragic fucking comedy that was last night
Unfolds to my inner devils sheer delight
A pointless fucking banter in an endless bout
With whiskey soaked frolic room tobacco mouth
Then a sickening trip to what I call the elitist cesspool
Beckoning all the sycophants and defeated yes-fools
Hung over, broke, and a round of apologies
Now come down Martinez with the modern mythology

Can’t nobody do it like 311
Fuckin’ up competition cuz there really is none
Steppin on your game from the first floor up tore up

“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
An' said, “What else you got left?”
Yeah, it was then that I got up to leave
But she said, “Don’t forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get”

I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum I asked her ""How come?""
And she buttoned her boot
And straightened her suit
Then she said, “Don’t get cute”
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum

She threw me outside
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked
And after finding out I’d
Forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, “No, dear”
I said, “Your words aren’t clear
You’d better spit out your gum”
She screamed 'til her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
And I covered her up and then
Thought I’d go look through her drawer

And when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in
You loved me then

And I, I never took much
I never asked for your crutch

Until you get through

Now that I reminisce on my reflection
Close to perfection, as a nigga can get, without protection
You never tripped, and even though we had our fights
Dinner every night
I'm cussin' and fussin' like it's impossible, to get it right
Time alone, away from home, 'cause I can do, bad on my own
Lookin' for more than just another bone
Will I be happy now I'm grown
It seems we have a problem with jealously
'cause you interruptin' while I'm on the phone
I got some bidness to handle so baby understand
Can't spend my whole life up under you, I'm a grown man
Could you respect me if I wasn't driven
All up in prison or even worse just barely livin'
So sympathize 'cause my motto was baby pimp or die
Still strivin' for thuggin' 'til I die, so simplify
I need some time to get my head straight trust in me
When I finally be you'll be my queen
Just let me run the streets

I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm choosin'
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples, how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up
Off of M.O.B
Fadin' me over somethin'
That's tellin' me don't run the streets


So tell me am I wrong?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made, and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3', and don't be late nigga
We hangin' out all night, while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in, 'cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die, I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle, just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, 'cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry just a little nigga, tryna make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen the rappin' or the drugs
But until then Give me love
And let me run the streets

Si sta spegnendo

E un gran silenzio
Pervade tutta la terra
Come il brontolio
Di un tuono lontano

E quel profumo
Della danza dei fiori
Che ormai si e' chiusa
In questo grande silenzio
E' gia' svanito
In questa arca perduta

Falling under skies of pain

Crashing over seven seas
Torturing the winter skies riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain!

Crashing steel and raging fury smash the quest destroy their army
Crush the legions of the twilight, templars of steel will burn

Cry far away as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the world as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes praying that I'll see you all


Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight

Watch you die I watch you die inside while fear controls your life
And reject this animosity that killed so many minds
You feel the power deep within the fear you hold inside
Just to find the reason for the treason now you will be mine

Screams of pain in death descending rise again from hell defending
Burn their hearts within the fire, warriors of light will be slain

Rise through the pain like the sun will rise again
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls


Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day

Fuck around will be reading your obituary

Don't even trick, my heart cold
I'm round the globe, I'm on parole
I ball hard, I go hard
They say I'm grimy, up to no good
Oh god

She a canna, she damn close to perfect

Get my man strapped, he gonn get my money back

Either way, come a nigga got you picking dough
They done made me mad, now I'm in my bad
And I'm back with the strap catch a case be the case
Rich nigga swag
Every step I take, every lil itsy bitsy move I make
Turn the big bags a birthday cake

Wait!

Got more money coming, try not to hate

So she may laugh in the autumn of your years
And when you're with her, you'll wonder if it's true
All they said of a world without you

Where she may come from
Where she may go
Who she may run from
No one will know

The father's son, thy kingdom come, electric ecstasy
Deliver us from all the fuss and give us sanctuary
Lead us all into arena, magnificent in death
Well let us serenade the sinner, we'll follow in his step
White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot
The fury songs, venomous wrongs so rich in tragedy
An overture forever more to senseless victories
Give to us this day of glory the power and the kill
So we avoid the wrath and all the almighty fire of


White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot
The heat's hot burns a lot
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men


Prepare to fight, unsheathe your scythe a ghastly beam of ill
To slice the life with blinding light and seventh dimensional skill
The centuries of dedication inherited until at last
From years of solar gladiation can only end in

Just a little ways with me
And as we walked and we would talk
All about our weddingday

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity.""

I took her by her golden curls
I drug her down to the river-side
An I there threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

And going home between twelve and one
I cried ""Lord, what have I've done?""
I've killed the girl I love
Because she would not marry me

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow

"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On Our Lady of the Harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind

In this space I might just see a ghost
I’ve been climbing up the walls all day
I've been dreaming of the place you'll go, go

My reflection is a haunting lesson
I can feel you in this lonely place

They're stone-throwing, they don't know that I'm weak
They don't know that my pain, it runs deep
They don't know that you ripped my heart out
Do you know that you ripped my heart out?
Now tell me, does it end with a noose?
Will they keep on saying that I'm bad news
No use 'cause you ripped my heart out
Come back, tell me where to start now

You burn me alive
The thought of you is making me choke
Burn me alive
And there's no way to put out the smoke

But if we make love until the next day
We'll have the rest of our time to celebrate


Four in the morning girl, now I don't wanna talk
We've been talking for hours, now you know I wanna fuck
Look I don't understand what it is you don't understand

Cause I do what the fuck I wanna do, they know wussup
They say my screws are loose, I say who cares, you know I'm rich
Look I don't have time to blow with a bitch shooting the shit
Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work
So I can whisper in your ear while pulling down your skirt
When I get the stroking girl you don't know what to say
Quick come quick, girl, I'm gone right away
Yeh, you nasty, girl, you nasty
And I'm into that, so get at me!


I don't want no good, good, good, good, girl

I said bitch, I wanna fuck you in the worst way
Hell yeah, I wanna fuck you on the first date
If I don't, I say, fuck you on Thursday
Cause then I won't want you, watch how fast I dump you
But right now I'm infatuated
You get to hang with me, girl, you graduated
I take you out for drinks and get you tipsy
Then I pull my dick out and I say kiss me
You're about to laugh ya little panties off
You only get one date, you better grab these balls
They wanna ride in fancy cars
That's what bitches do
They like to rub it then suck it and lick it too
She's a nasty little trap ho slut
But I like that shit, so let's fuck

Do you think he's looking down, curled up on his couch right now?
As we fail to figure it out, does he turn down the sound?
Is he proud? Are we proud?
Guess we forgot how to live a life with no filter
Making boring people famous
Let's pretend they're fascinating
Let's tell little girls that pretty girls are better
Or that pigment or religion really matters


We're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created could make for some good TV


Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made
Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days


Does he hang his head at all the greed that we possess?
As the anti-social media perpetuates the mess
Maybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the loose ends
Stressed like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us
God, or is it Mr. G to me?
I hope that through the static, you’ll show us the clarity
'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet
Wonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep
Do you sleep in peace?

We are not hopeless, we are just coping
The mayhem is rolling, but it ain't showbiz
Reality's potent, chaotic, I know it
But we're growing, have some hope in us
And were we worth all the time you gave up?

Are inside your own dreams

Run swift like Elijah, away from the middle

But now your boy is up, and I'm fit as a fiddle

You know what you want, but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever
When you feel you've lost your way

But you gave me one good reason
To fight and never walk away

For you, I walk up close and lay a nigga's kid
For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a Thug, this the way I show my love for you
Nigga for you, I get the coke, I'ma turn it into cash
For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass
For you, if we get knocked, I'ma have to take the weight
Cause with a record like yours, doawg, you ain't staying upstate
Nigga for you, I kill a whole goddamn crew 
Cause I know you'd do the same thing too
I ride for you, you ride for me, my enemies your enemies
How could you not love a thug like me?


Would you ride for me?

Would you die for me?

Would you cry for me?

And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind I wear the same shit tomorrow
When you grind it's Showtime at the Apollo

Well, my flow's like a hoe that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad 'cause they see me in Cancun, bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the hood, my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still living like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice I'm called Jack Frost, man
And while we sipping on Cris' you sipping backwash, man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat - what?

"Riding up their faces down
Bright young things wade through town
Starved souls come to life
With pursed up lips and startrucked smiles
See the creature on the prowl
Pushing through the sea-foam crow
Bedridden femme fatales
Lining up to follow them around

I have caught this city
It won't me go

Archives of wasted times
In hazy states and drunken minds
Hung beauty on the walls
Who risk the world to bare it all
Gloss writers stuck for say
Ask why it has to be that way
Star at their nascent lines
And wonder why they lack for rhyme

Our sick generation
Is our festival

Stop to watch the sun sink down
Beneath a line of manmade clouds
Rode through the flood zone mire
With broken lights and one good tire
Raced up the temple hill
Took a blessing for a cheap thrill
Disposed it for a laugh
Post it to a facebook photograph

And I love this city
It's a spectacle
A laugh a minute

Raised to avoid the lie
Never learning how or why
Taught to defend that right
But never knowing what to fight
The scholling we'd froget
Chained is to a world of debt
Waste paint on what we feel
Without the art to make it real

But we love this city
We won't let it go
And we are this city

I watched the sun sink down
Beneath the line of manmade clouds
I watched the undead rise
And walk the streets in search of life
I've seen you back away
Talking to yourself for days
I've seen you sifting through
A trumpet up list of what life did to you

And I thought you'd make it
But you let go
Let yourself go crazy

He wanted to grow up to be
An actor, but he never told anybody

He likes to spill all of his guts
On the top of a well stocked bar
And then swallow them bit by bit
Remembering every scar

It's a valid reason for every drink
And a new tattoo is a new reason to think

He likes to pretend that he's all sewn up
It makes for a much stronger case
But there is blood underneath that skin
That scar is not so easy to erase

He walks with a glass cane now, he's careful
When holding his body up straight
Can't go outside anymore when it's raining
Can't smash up that beautiful face

Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
Your crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me


Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me


Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick
Dip-dip next ho, they be on my dick like
All on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
Real niggas know what I mean

Did I hit that? Quit that? How did I hit that? Niggas know how I keep it live
Live try this suprised but she just say I'm on her eyes

Won't stop now, won't slack off

To stop from falling down a mine

While others'll die in vain tryin' to front for a name


Dreams fulfilled, gave us more room to build
Strong climb made more time for wounds to heal
I can see the sun, must've been blessed to be the one
Set, free to run
Same baby moms, new seed to come
Breathin' lungs, through the sonogram see the thumb
So regardless, male or female, love either one
G's and tons branched out, copped the ranch house
To plan,  Martin needed some space to plot my plans out
Speak of life, still rock low, plus the sneaker type
Reefer kites, pushin' a stick make you breeze through lights
See through sites, gun shots, used to run spots
Slung rocks, nearly got rich off of one block
Saw the light, caught a case, couldn't afford to fight
Lawyer white, had to cop out or four to life
Poison bites, my brain, flyin' high flames
Tryin' to change, trapped between worlds kinda strange




Yo it's either or, used to by girl ?Lee Rahol?
G's galore, Christian Dior, devils believe in war
Need some more currency, streets observin' me
Third degree, tryin' to see billions before they murder me
Thoroughly thoughts react, let the Porsche mack accross tracks
Catch me in Haiti, ridin' horse back
Seek religion, study life, tryin' to see the vision
Weeks in prison a help a wise man peep his livin'
Reach decisions, analyze, scope the game, wit hopes to change
Before the stress overdose the brain, most remain
Shockwaves, I rock shades through the Tropic Haze
Under Palm Trees, puffin' lye for days, liver ways
Cold chillin', old villan, known for buildin'
Sittin' back, controlin' millions
What's right or wrong? Shorter days, nights is long
Keep ya cipher strong, just in case, it might be on




So what's the remedy, for bein' invaded by your enemy
Envy me, had a cold heart since infancy
Below freezin', used to flip for no reason
Now beyond that, learned to relax, mastered slow breathin' Blowin' Hundreds
Spendin' paper's so redundant
I'm from it, most large niggas over and done wit
No one to run wit, just a few from the Old School
Ocean cruise, layin' back soakin' the blues, scopin' the views
Never once, open the news
It's all stress, placed on the broke or confused
So know the game, some'll make the Hall Of Fame

And when will a time come

I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches


Got a new bitch that's so bad, yeah, she don't know what she doin'
And her ass so round and fat, when she touch me, I'm like boooing!
I want head and I want tails, so I don't wanna flip a coin
I don't kiss it, I don't tell, so her close friend she can join
They don't call me from the pens, that's to see how things are goin'
So the money, it still flowing, get a Rider Gang, it's still glowin'
And my neck and my wrist and my ears and my fist, got diamonds all over shit glowin'
And the Lambo ain't got no top, it ain't summer yet but it's hot
You gon' lose the speech when you hit the streets and you see the bitches I got
You better believe it's real from the Philippines to Brazil
Lil Mexican chica, I want you to meet her, people can give it to you pure
100% uncut, now nigga you know wassup


Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches


MJG, bitch I got them 8 balls
4 door garage, bitch, I need 8 cars
They want me locked up, they singin' like Akon
Or shot up like a dope head arm
Bitch my life right and you niggas dead wrong
I would take your head on, so you can see me head on
I'm gettin' my air blown, you know what her head on
She got my head gone, shit, I'm 'bout to head home
Pimp zone, that's my destination
Still street, never handed in my resignation
Ding dong, I'm at your doorbell waiting
Who tryna get served, I'm 'bout to do some catering, huh!


Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches

Let the coupe roller coast, get the fuck out my way 
It will start makin' sense, I guess, when I get older

Like when you grow up doing donuts in the parking lot
You hit the station, go insane, and when the kick-drum drops
You know

Called you up so we could reminisce
About the old days, gold days, how we've been
The city's rusty after what we did
We did, we did, we did


Hey, and though I know it's been a long time in the records
But I saw you smiling like dynamite in the record store
And now I'm shaking , waiting 
As you come say hello

I'm the king of the island on a rusty throne
Who the fuck wants to rule, ruling all alone, alone, alone, alone


Hey and though I know it's been a long time in the records

"Awww shit
What, unh
You know the freaks can’t handle it
We keep on searching from the seaside
To the mountainside, come on
Hardly outstyled and hardly outblazened
Nectar natural, completely amazing
Others more concerned with just fronting on hardness
I flow sweet with millennium niceness
I don’t know if they’re just scared or what
But a little sincerity would knock them on their butt
I keep my dogs at my side and I keep my shit tight
Let me tell you how I feel, all right

Y’all’s radio rock ain’t tough
Can’t move to that ain’t deep enough
One more time groove on the line
Chill’s up my spine, ready, rewind

The only thing that never gets old is honesty
You’ll probably be caught up fronting
The only thing you always try to be is hard
Because you’re scared that someone might pull your card
The only thing that never gets played out
Is melody, I’m hearing it calling me
It’s plain to see because it’s all laid out

Full ride, I’m a master of technology
Livin’ my life nice in pursuit of groove-ology
I’m getting vibes like you checking me out
Without a doubt I pull clout and crush crews in a rout
I’m a Doberman in any given reaction
Well-mannered and reserved, yet ready for action
I let you have it all, I got nothin' to hide
I tell ya how we comin’, we comin’ full ride
Full ride we work it on the inside
As you’d expect we come correct
While others just run and hide
Full ride we work it on the inside
As you’d expect we come correct, unh

I get fucked up rockin' the jams, I bump disco
Playin’ records all day I then let go
I’m the king of my town
But when my girl is around
Parlay like the Count of Monte Cristo
So simple the jams are in front of me
Get drunk in New York, makin’ fun of me
When we play it’s a serious thing
To all the people who gather
Here’s what we bring

The only thing that never gets old is honesty
You’ll probably be caught up fronting
The only thing you always try to be is hard
Because you’re scared that someone might pull your card
The only thing that never gets played out
Is melody, I’m hearing it calling me
It’s plain to see because it’s all laid out

Yeah, yeah, what
Full ride we work it in on the inside
As you’d expect we come correct
While others just run and hide
Full ride, we work it on the inside
As you’d expect we come correct

Yes, yes, full ride we work it on the inside
As you’d expect we come correct
While others just run and hide
Full ride, we work it on the inside

For the club is full of ballers i'ma come up on


Well brat, I met about two or three
Talkin right and tryin to leave with me
And go cut something something

With a five million dollar spot
And rockin platinum charm bracelets


Buy the benz and the cadillac trucks
Got chicks in every city backin it up

Down which our hearts would like to go

Under that old illusion that it's safe

But it's not the reason it was made
So forgive me if I wander off
And forgive me more if I just stay

Sing another song for the lost ones
We're the ones who need it the most
Every time you run it'll cost you
But it doesn't stop us running

If a coward dies a thousand times
Then there's a graveyard in my head
Cause it took me years to say the words
That you did not even need said

Sing another song for the lost ones
We're the ones that need it the most
Nothin' that you fear is forgotten
It follows you around like

Then everything danced to a stranger tune
And we found our song and we found our truth
And now that we know it's that we always knew
Farewell to the chains we were born into

And as we danced among the ashes of our lives
We laughed it off
And as we burned our tiny world to find the ocean
Just beyond those paper walls

Overcast fame, wait until it rains flames
Got an acid-washed brain, looking like bleach stains
I blame the reign of fucking chains
That's why all of us are tame, staying in a fucking cage
I can't live this way, while we harvest limited grain
They stay sipping cold Moet
Satan hears me pray, yes, I became his prey
Blood leaks out my veins
Got my palms pressed together as I whisper, ""Namaste""

Yung $carecrow with a couple pills foamin' out my mouth
Nicotine smoking, motherfuckers out the south
I, I cop a slug, spray 'em up, let 'em lay in blood
Stuck in the mud sippin' Tuss, I can't give it up
Don't give a fuck when the bud's stuffed up in my blunt
I'm saying, ""Please, p-p-please don't make me make a stain""
Hollow tips in your brain, body filled with pain
Come feel the reign of the clinically insane, ho


Because me really love to make a stang
Mister high-capper, don't make me touch ya, mane
Because me really love to make a stang
Mister high-capper, don't make me touch ya, mane

What is that stain?
That is a mess
Made on your shirt
Sunk on your chest
Dripping out wet and I'm leaving the set
Taking your heart with no evidence left
Better expect
To run out of breath
Your life will consist of the end of reality
Tell the police I'm Baraka on coppas'
My Kombat is mortal from all the brutalities
Put in the work with the deadliest faculties
This is a robbery coming to peace
Visit the haters vacate in the heat
The Devils are proud of me now that I teach it
The classes are over I am released
The classes to wake up the students asleep
Citizens playing the game 
It's Lucifer shows at a pretty 


Because me really love to make a stang
Mister high-capper, don't make me touch ya, mane

How do we honor those who have fallen and died for this dream?
I'm sure of one thing, it's not with gridlock or bickering
We're the children of explorers, that came here from every corner
The adventurers that settled this land
We led the world, fought tyranny, touched the stars, brought liberty
Let's do that again


Tonight I dare you to dream
Go on, believe impossible things
Whenever anybody says there's anything we can't do
I mean, after all, there's an American flag on the moon


Outside the other night, you should have seen the moonlight
It's enough to make you squint your eyes
So my five year old had learned about
The lunar landing and he walked out
And started staring at the sky
Stood there for a while, he got a great big smile
And said, ""Dad, I think I can see it, can you?""
I bowed my head, closed my eyes and said
""Yeah, son, I think I do""


Tonight I dare you to dream
Go on, believe impossible things
Whenever anybody says there's anything we can't do
Cause, after all, there's an American flag on the moon


Oh, in two hundred years
Think about all that we've done so far
I don't see any reason why tomorrow can't be ours


Tonight I dare you to dream
Go on, believe impossible things
Whenever anybody says there's anything we can't do
Cause, after all, after all
There's an American flag on the moon

She remembers the nights he’d come calling
His yellow-silk tie
In love, she saw him falling for her in the fire of July
Then one day as the nights grew longer
Blackberry winter in a little white church
Stood a young pretty bride


Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named
Forever changed


She remembers the change in her body
The blooming within'
And how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind
Then one night as the days grew longer
That Indian summer
She brought love into the world
Cried and held me then


Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever child
Forever changed


Some days she’ll talk about aunt Rosie
The sister she lost
Asking when she’s coming over
And why she hasn’t called
Some days I just hold her fragile hand
As time creeps across the floor
Some days it almost kills me
Watching her memories slip away a little more


Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named
Forever child
Forever loved
Forever changed

"You bastard I'm ripping it faster
Gotta deal with the fact I'm the master
I see you dipping in a stall
Gonna fall through the wall
While I stand tall so
FEAR ME
Get in my way never stay
Take it away gotta obey
Never your way
Gotta chill down I got to say
I'm gonna slam the trunk

I'm gonna slam the trunk

You're coming at me and they say that you're crazy
A growling gangsta with a tongue like a razor
From what you said, faked, know why you're hated
Not complicated; You're overrated

To growl like fucking computer is in my genes
Like a mainframe got a space brain
Like a pacemaker placed in my brainstem
In my basement I hide all you fuckers who
HATE ME
Like I hate motherfuckers with a back-up plan
Like I see you skip in the back now gotta back down
Before I slam the trunk

I'm gonna slam the trunk

You're coming at me and they say that you're crazy
A growling gangsta with a tongue like a razor
From what you said, faked, know why you're hated
Not complicated; You're overrated

You're kind of fabricated
And your attitude is frail
Your actions simulated
Going down, down, down boy

I've got dictation within my veins
Like a mutation, and a fixation
On the fucked up rhymes in my narration
Are you getting what I'm saying - FOOL?
FEAR ME
Get in my way, never say
Take it away, gotta obey
Never your way
Gotta chill down I gotta say
I'm gonna slam the trunk

You're coming at me and they say that you're crazy
A growling gangsta with a tongue like a razor
From what you said, faked, know why you're hated
Not complicated; You're overrated

You're coming at me and they say that you're crazy
A growling gangsta with a tongue like a razor
From what you said, faked, know why you're hated
Not complicated; You're overrated

"Standing on the shore, facing east
I can't feel you

Standing on the shore, facing east
Your impermanence
You're taking water
Listing lazily out of view

I remember when we were friends
I remember calling you friend

Standing on the shore my ear aimed east
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore

I still remember
Laughing and fighting
I still remember

Standing on the shore, watching for you
You're painted into a corner
Whatever fits in your pockets; you'll get your due
Just like before
With all the others

You warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in
Yeah, you warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in

In hiding, where there's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you

There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you

Standing on the shore, getting old
You left me here amid the vape clowns
I must admit: I miss the laughing
But not so much you

One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back

Standing on the floor, facing you
I can't see you, your impermanence
This place is empty
Empty of you

And if I see you, it's like nothing went wrong
Yeah, if we meet again tomorrow, just like nothing went wrong But there I go

Erasing our chances
Just by asking
""How do you sleep?""

One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain

Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway



Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good


We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living

Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste



The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good


And I'll never go home again

Favourite friend

I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun

Play along

But I live in a hologram with you


Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us


Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good


And I'll never go home again

Favourite friend

I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun

Play along

But I live in a hologram with you

Layin' on my back now
Lay another track down
Brought the black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, try not take a cap now
I bring the black cats out, now you fucked 
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smoking thraxx, read my tats from the backseat 
Why you throwin' shade like you finna phase me?
You a hoe ass bitch, need a Maxi 
Pad for your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's, but my raps free
Young bitch, I got plenty, on my bottle it say Remy
On my belt that shit say Fendi and the back green 


Got me talkin' 'bout my clothes girl 
When I fall, won't you pick me up 
I'm talkin' 'bout my old girl 
When I call, she don't pick it up 
My head hurt from the drugs 
It's somethin' in the bud, man, I need a new plug 
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb 'cause they give me all their brains


Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up 
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch, I got that trap sound
Auto-Tune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rove'
Drivin' fast while she listenin' to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get yo' ass beat
One for the money, blow
Two for the show, my flow go perfect with a sad beat 
Everywhere I go, all I ever see is snow
In the summertime, pussy make me happy 


Got me talkin' 'bout my clothes girl 
Won't you pick me up 
I'm talkin' 'bout my old girl 
When I call she don't pick it up 
My head hurt from the drugs
It's somethin' in the bud man, I need a new plug 
I feel it in my veins

Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body 
That blows like a 12-gauge shotty  feel me!

And God said he should send his one begotten son

To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! 
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!


Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la


I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me and my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary


Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail Mary, nigga!


Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?

They got a APB out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs


Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that muthafucka, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond; when I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up


Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?

I think it's time to realize it's done
I guess I have to accept it
I was never the one
Yeah, it was so good
I thought I fell into someone else's dream
Yeah, but I let it be mine, thought you let it be yours
No nothing's ever what it seems


I thought I felt it all around
But now it's lyin there on the ground
Why was it there for me
But not for you?


Tell me, tell me
Because it's been so long
Now I'm sitting here
And you're so far gone


I'm staring down at the page in a magazine
I looked up at the TV, but it's just an empty screen
When we were together, I thought it was ecstasy
Oh I can tell the sun's still shining
But shadows are all I can see


And everywhere I go
I never see a face I know
What could I say
That could make you come back this way




Now I know I should have known
And I see I could have seen
You got a restless soul
Need to know, I want to find out
If your fields are still green



Now I hope that what I have found
Could somehow be true
Why is it such a long long way and you

Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is


You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty


Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river


You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty


You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty


Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah


You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face

To help me dry my eyes
I need a blue sky over here
So I can clear my mind
Maybe your soft breath on my back
To make me feel at ease

It's a rainy day in June
The sky is grey and I am blue
Trying to make it without you

Yesterday morning I woke up
On the wrong side of the bed
And on the right side laid a note
I knew what it said
Then the rain came, hasn't stopped

Every thought began with you

Pull out the blueprint, bumpin' dat Gunplay
In a Maybach, pockets stay fat
So fly, I could parallel park on a fucking runway
Going down a one way the wrong way, shoot barrel long range
Swag like pro ball, gave her a ring, phone call
Money talk, pole vault, walked in, drove off
So comfortable at the dealership, I don't take my robe off
I wake up and I get to it, breakfast time I might sea food it
Lunch time I might lamb chop it
And you do is talk shit like you was eatin' booty
Southside in my bloodstream, smokin' on that propane
I could tell ya ass one thing, I like gettin' head wearing both chains
All white with no stains, I been trappin' fore the Grammy nods
I been countin' money so long I'mma need a damn hand massage
So many cars, I can barely park
So many cars, I need another damn garage
I'm famous with my fam around, damn I wish I had my dad around
Gave a nigga a Lamborghini, so that's a motherfuckin' lamb-me-down

Good times, smokin' J's, rockin' J's, I'm the rap Ernie Barnes
If I paint a canvas it'd be melee, firearms
Viacom, maricón, if she bad I invite her home
Buying chains like I'm buyin' homes

My fuckin' Power Rangers couldn't protect me from that LAPD kick door
Motel, pig-pork
Swim through the living room, straight to the bedroom, lookin' for bricked dope
My papa looked at my mama, lookin' at that closet like
""There that shit go""
Two keys and a thumper, 10K with the mustard
A whole family and no buster, this don't add up
My padre facin' them three strikes
And my mama just smacked the pipe
Crack smoke got crash tight, this shit still bad, 'cause
The boys peeped a Brillo pad and some glass tucked
And it's lookin' like my parents was up in here runnin' all through that stash dumb
But the fact, crack different than coke
Plus the smoke wasn't close enough to choke me
Lowered scrutiny so mom could kick big facts for bruh
The truth is we held the bag for this kid we took in
Tryna part with his old ways, maybe we all mistook him
'Cause I knew something was fucked up when he said
""Don't open or look in this here satchel that I'll be back for in just a couple of minutes""
Then hella hours later, like do I cook dinner now or later?
Worried about cold food for a cold fool
Motherfucker put my family in danger
I blame myself, pardon my anger
I never looked inside his stuff so he never really needed to hide his stuff
When you showed me what was really inside this stuff
I never had a clue
Now I know as police, you gotta do what you gotta do
But this my family, all I got is us, my nigga
My own mother just shot at us, my nigga
This is why we here
And I don't fuck with niggas I don't know
But I had a heart to help this kid in danger, tears in anger
Gemini gettin' violently
Police silence don't help anxiety
My daddy's priors tame all of his wildin'
All of these pilots, not one of them flyin'
Y'all planning on trying?
This flight is diving, nose tucked
Po-po stuck, play your part
All this commotion and neighbors listenin' like, ""Oh fuck""
Shit finna spark
All this emotion, need a decision made with some heart
'Cause ours is broken, they tryna lock the third notch on my pop's choker
This shit ain't kosher
Moms is oh for if CPS get sent them pages
I ain't gon' see my parents for ages
All this erosion, no more protection
Shit don't feel safe
What graduation? What degrees?
What dissertation? What imagination?
Imagine my whole world taken away from me
All over some bass and misconstrued melodies
My heart racin', clutchin' my red Ranger, pacin'
I can barely breathe
And mister policeman, told policeman, we got what we need
Just let 'em be

Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me

O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

"I keep floating down the river but the ocean never comes
Since the operation I heard you're breathing just for one
Now everything is imaginary, especially what you love
You left another message, said it's done
It's done

When I hear beautiful music it's always from another time
Old friends I never visit, I remember what they're like
Standing on a doorstep full of nervous butterflies
Waiting to be asked to come inside
Just come inside

But I keep going out
I can't sleep next to a stranger when I'm coming down
It's 8 a.m., my heart is beating too loud
Too loud
Don't be so amazing or I'll miss you too much
I felt something that I had never touched
Everything gets smaller now the further that I go
Towards the mouth and the reunion of the known and the unknown
Consider yourself lucky if you think of it as home
You can move mountains with your misery if you don't
If you don't

It comes to me in fragments, even those still split in two
Under the leaves of that old lime tree I stood examining the fruit
Some were ripe and some were rotten, I felt nauseous with the truth
There will never be a time more opportune

So I just won't be late
The window



Closes, shock rolls over in a tidal wave
And all the color drains out of the frame
So pleased with a daydream that now living is no good
I took off my shoes and walked into the woods
I felt lost and found with every step I took

We were caught up in love, we were swept away
Seems like overnight, from out of the blue

Do what I have to do
No matter where you are, you'll always have my heart
I may never get over you


A hopeless dream's, insanity
I'm just a fool with a fantasy
I close my eyes, I feel your touch
Just as real, as it ever was

My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver linin'
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime

I'da never thought that you would have my back

Threw some punches then we had a laugh

Hangin' tough through thick and thin
Kickin' up dust wherever we go

I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too fucked on and over both ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense, I ain't made of money
Maybe some day, you can take it from me?

Say ""the weather down here so fine""
Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand
Fever roll up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground
See here how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up
And then the
Sun it going down
Shine through my window and
My friends they come around


Come around

The people don't care

"A brand new baby was born yesterday, just in time
Papa cried, baby cried, said your tears are like mine
I heard some words from a friend on the phone
Didn't sound so good
The doctors gave him two weeks to live
I'd give him more if I could

You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could

Down the middle drops one more grain of sand
They say that new life makes losing life easier to understand
Words are kind they help ease the mind
I'll miss my old friend
And though you've got to go we'll keep a piece of your soul
One goes out, one comes in

I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths

Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene


Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh


In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

I've got some cookies from our junk food run
And here's a couple beers so
Let's go create some fun
Supplies are limited and I'm all out
Of any explanation
Of what I'm on about


I'm tired
Of having to try
To convince you if I
Go along with you it all will
Backfire
I know you had plans
Your intentions were grand
But it's out of my hands
And it isn't the way I pictured it
Either


Well things felt weird but you said that's alright
That it was not a problem
And we could just sit tight
And when you said that I was sure I cringed
'Cause you had no suspicion
That I had come unhinged


Or just tired--
I cannot say which
But there's always a hitch
That will cause the whole thing to
Backfire
I know you had plans
Your intentions were grand
But it's out of my hands now

I know you'd like to be the St. Bernard
Who rushes to the rescue
When there's an avalanche
But in my panic I may pull too hard
And the novice lifeguard
Gets rushed off in the ambulance


I'm tired
I cannot seem to
Get a message to you
That the rescue you planned has just
Backfired
I know you had plans
Your intentions were grand
But it's out of my hands now

And turn into a life that we can live


Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead

So learn a lesson from someone
Who will never repeat the many
Tragic mistakes of his past

As you're still on your feet
So keep it quiet now

They're spoken to me
Better be careful when you're writing checks
Don't you question how

All my cribs came with a damn pool
Used to stash work in my camel
Young 6'5"" with the handle
If you don't watch Atlanta then you need to turn the channel
See I pull up in this bitch in a Phantom
Front grill looking like it's dancin' 
Put some stacks on your head little boy 
Yeah they 'bout to call you the grandson 
Pussy nigga gonna need a tampon 
Put rifle bullets in a handgun 
Keep a bankroll on me, nigga
By the time I eat some bacon I got bands on
All my cars I done put rims on 'em
I done touched down, no end zone
All that bitch do is run her mouth, nigga
On the right but that bitch got a Sprint phone 
Man she got about 100 acres
Enough yard for me to put a couple Benz's on
And I just pop me a perc
I might fuck that bitch with my Timbs on

Turn it up in my head phones, please
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
More, ha ha, comin' to a ghetto near you


I wasn't mad until these tricks shot me
It's time I sanitize my posse
Look how paranoid these niggas got me
Cellular calls are being traced since surveillance silently
Mama, chill, thug livin' pay the bills, I'm dyin' violently
Closed caskets, expose bastards, I leave 'em bloody
Delores Tucker, don't let your kids
Hear a nigga speak on gettin' money
Ain't nothin' funny, green got a nigga seein' things
Why? Hit the lye, hope to God I can fly
Lethal weapon, I'm a savage; still a method to my madness
Blast, niggas laugh, calling my cash cabbage
Read 'em and weep, put 'em to sleep, they hell bound
Lyrics will leave 'em spell bound
Clown, now tired of being held down
Cross my heart, hope to die, blind with some pussy
Millionaire, livin' care free, sucka free, playa haters miss me
Hope in hard times never catch me slippin'
Fuck authorities! They wonder why minorities be trippin'
We ain't havin' it, time to tear this shit back
Ghetto children kick back
Once I hit the MAC, niggas'll never get they shit back
Spit it so eloquently, my pistols represent me
Bust until my rounds empty; back for the street fame


One love to my true thugs
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
Bust! Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
All out warfare, eye for a eye
Bustin' on my enemies, bad boy killin'
Straight dissin' you
Fuck Lil' Kim, you nasty bitch!


Temperatures rises, niggas blinded by my lyrical disguise
No time to plot retreats, niggas shiver and die
Multiple rounds found laced in his body and face
Wrapped in plastic, the acid erased all traces
Criminal tactics, the rap game became so drastic
Military mind,  mash all the hoes, get blasted
If we bleed then they suffocate, chokin' in terror
So we strive seein' our lives be reflected in mirrors
The prophecy is clear, niggas lock and load, disappear
Strategize with no fear, wagin' war for years
The crack game wasn't big enough, ready to rush
Bitch made motherfuckers get murdered and touched
I go to jail niggas screamin' free me, speakin' freely
Conversatin' with my comrades kickin' Swahili
Indeed they should fear my first seed
It gets worse, planned a curse to be a G, on the first to breathe
Currency in stacks, artillery in the back
Strapped, armies, we camouflaged in all black
When we attack, holla out my set, nigga
Tighten your jaw, givin' birth to Outlawz, street fame


Bust, nigga bust!
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
Only Makaveli the Don
Can put it down like this; ain't none like me
Comin' to a ghetto near you, with street fame


Positive identification, got me rushed to the station
Stuck in this line up, tryin' hard to hide my face
They placed the name but can't recall description
I ain't did shit, officer, that bitch trippin'
Promise retaliation, their plan busted, no man to be trusted
Everything corrupted once man touch it
Kamikaze, hopin' that none of the spies find me
That's why we bye bye daily, knowin' cops trail me
But why cry? Floatin' while we tokin' on this potent branch
Flossin' in the thug stance, pistol tucked inside my pants
Never underestimate me, playa hate me, see me and hide
Sure as hollow-points shatter, enemies die
Spread love, dead thugs gettin' buried in riches
Take a chance to advance; fuck them worryin' bitches!
Penitentiary's a possibility, bust and pray
Wear a rubber so I live to fuck another day, hey!
Ain't nothin' strange, I'm 25, dyin' to change
But still I bang wantin' street fame


That's the end of that
Thugged out, Makaveli the Don
Representin' the Outlawz, street fame
One love to my true niggas
Comin' to a ghetto near you street fame
Makaveli the Don, Killuminati
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame


Yo, check this out, I'ma tell you like this
If the lifestyle that you livin'
Got you taking more fuckin' shorts than gettin' props
Then that lifestyle need to stop
Best to recognize some Outlaw shit
‘Cause only in this Outlaw lifestyle can you truly come to
To see what this life's supposed to be like
Nigga, you'll start to see riches
Fine bitches and hittin' switches
Shit, to me that shit sound delicious; street fame

Where we once planned our life together

Come let us live some moments over

I love you then and will forever
I can't forget come go with me

I can't forget the flowers blooming
The rose that I pick for you
Time changed you but I'm not changing

I'll carve your name to prove I love you

Frankie Laine was singing ""Jezebel""
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, ""Look, you don't know me now
But very soon you will
So won't you let me see
Won't you let me see
I said won't you let me see
Your naked body?""




She said, ""Just dance me
To the dark side of the gym
Chances are, I'll let you do almost anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice""
""But no, you cannot see
No, you cannot see
She said no, you cannot see
My naked body.""







We're dancing close, the band is playing ""Stardust""
Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us
She says, ""You've got a minute left to fall in love""
In solemn moments such as this I've put my trust
Yes, and all my faith to see
All my faith to see
All my faith to see
Her naked body




Oh my babe, oh, my babe

Oh, oh, my babe

Oh my babe, oh, my babe

Oh my babe, oh my babe

I mind fucked an intellectual
Had sex with her on my sectional
Slowed it down, take it extra slow
Bust on myself like Plaxico
Oh alright here I go
Shorty got my love in the finger fold
I got a manicure, pedicure
I got her hair done and credit card new
I'm balling on her big time
Told shorty I'm 6'5""
Stand up on my bankroll, make me look like I'm 6'9""
She look like she been fine
She always call me big time
Pinky ring on, you should see the way I sip wine
I'm maestro in the main suite
Make a side chick out your main squeeze
Better hop on board 'fore the train leave
Shorty outta place cause I slang D
And I'm changes need my chain freeze
Meant to say my chain froze
Everytime I change clothes


Cherish the game
When we fly far away
Sky dive in a puddle of mud
Make it rain blue dolphin
All I see is blue dolphin



I like when she smile
She like when I make her smile
She like when I put it down
She like when I come in town
I like when she on the brown
She like when I'm on the loud
Seen her take some coke then smile
Seen her take a perc then pow
Birkin bag see no salt
All on the beach with toes out
All on the beach sea gulls out
All in the jeep windows down
Where I come from the Regals out
She knows I turn up on the molly
She doing string thing for money
I'm trying to put it in her tummy
I might whisper in her earlobe
I'm blowing kisses in her earlobe
I'm telling things she ain't built for
Money long as Lincoln Continentals
Codeine with a touch of Sprite
Geeked up for a hundred nights
I'm a roll had a Cuban link
In a figaro this a finger roll

It's a world of indecision

So self destructive

And such an ugly business

In and out of fashion

You always leave your mark

An indefinite decision

A dangerous remark

Don't turn your head away

The distance that's between us

Gets bigger every day

* how come you never see

You're as faraway as faraway can be

You're as faraway as faraway can be

You try so hard to impress

You talk the telephone to death

It's what you can't see that counts

But you haven't worked that out yet

There is no reason

There is no plan

The truth can be deceptive

From such a quiet man

There's madness in your words

Not wishing to be heard

But just like yesterday

You've already slipped away







You're as faraway as faraway

As faraway as faraway

As faraway as faraway

As faraway as faraway

As faraway from me as you can be

Tie the noose, no recall
No resolve, fuck withdrawal
Rather shoot up 'til I fall

While these fuckers had a dinner every night time
Smoke, smokin' that dope off the foil, let me ball
Hoe, please don't call, don't fuck with y'all
Spray paint the walls with blood and whatever
Drag you outside, let you rot in the weather

My birth was an error


I am the Lord of Loneliness
I'll hold my breath, just spoke with death
He said he hopes for the best
Told him I'm ropin' my neck
Then I woke up chokin' from the hole in my chest
Somehow I manage to function and hope
Every day got a lump in my throat
That's them pills swallowed whole
Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
End up humpin' they throat
Get the fuck away from me, I hate all of you, faithfully

It feels like she has always been
Close by your side and nothing seems to matter

When love is old, it's like a song
The words are bare, the music's wrong
And like a flower, that slowly dies and fades away
Leaving no trace at all, of the new affair

It’s too hot to sleep
And time is running away
Feel like my soul has
Turned into steel
I’ve still got the scars
That the sun didn’t heal
There’s not even room enough
To be anywhere


It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there


Well, my sense of humanity
Has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing
There’s been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter
And she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing
What was in her mind
I just don’t see why I should even care


It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there


Well, I’ve been to London
And I’ve been to gay Paris
I’ve followed the river
And I got to the sea
I’ve been down on the bottom
Of a world full of lies
I ain’t looking for nothing
In anyone’s eyes
Sometimes my burden
Is more than I can bear


It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there




I was born here, and I’ll die here
Against my will
I know it looks like I’m moving
But I’m standing still
Every nerve in my body
Is so vacant and numb
I can’t even remember what it was
I came here to get away from
Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer


It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

He'll find his own when he finds alone

Never let go
Waking up the silence passing

Never let go
Holding on to something you can't lose

Never let go
Waiting for a sign of passion

Must come
Down, down, down, down, down

If you were just to hold my hands

The plot would flop
And jumbo would be safe to land

I ride through the slumbering shadows
Along the Navajo Trail

When it's twilight and crickets are calling
And coyotes are making a wail
I  dream by a smoldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail

I love to lie and to the music
When the wind is strumming a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbing
It always finds me wishing on a star

Well what do you know it's morning already

This shining city built of gold
A far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye 'round here
Look to the waters of the deep

A city of evil

There sat a seven-headed beast
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked

The beast and the harlot


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great


The city dressed in jewels and gold
Fine linen, myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once
As her mourners watch her burn

Destroyed in an hour

Merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss
With her sins piled to the sky

The beast and the harlot


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great


The day has come for all us sinners
If you're not a servant, you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city
Looking back on her to see there's nothing around

I don't believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to Hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird

10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore
K. Dot had turned Curious George
You know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for
Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads
Before he turned right to get them shots through the door
They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic
So he'd risk his own life, to get someone else killed
But in the process, get injured, it don't make sense
It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying the solve the crime of these rap souls
What if B.I.G. never did it big
Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes
Would it make my flow flow more persistent
Would it raise up the bar of competition, who knows
Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV
Would the battle be less interesting, if it wasn't personal
If Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening
People thinking its a publicity stunt
What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow
Hip-hop would really be fucked
Something like Milli Vanilli
Nothing different, quite similar
Filling up my mind capacity
Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony
What if the shooter-
Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side
Killed two birds with one stone, both would've died
Now lets rewind


Before we go

Picture years, with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky

But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets
Dominating the population of-
L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay
Matter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit
Y'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit
No drive bys, no flags stickin' out pockets
No NWA dudes, just rappin like Cre Cru
Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two
Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive
Or would he been lost his life to the streets
No match, no cars in that driveway
What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin
On this L.A. strip, would these rap n*ggas use his name
Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap would they try to fall back on this drug game
These rappers ass backwards
Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine
Not to smoke, but to slang
Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane
Just think about it




Imagine life without death would you even feel alive
Your people that passed, what if they never died
Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness
The street living what if the crack epidemic
Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings
Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims
Imagine if heroine didn't affect our system
They say drug money funding the labels today
What about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A
Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
Would they start in the hood, or executive suites
Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me
You could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore, had won that election
Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected
Imagine the penal system without witness protection
Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling

She'll be pulling on them tight blue jeans
She'll go down to Cowboy's, buy herself a cold one
And on a Friday night in Dallas, she's a cowboy's dream
Something tells me she'll sit out the first one
Then they'll play George Strait and she'll be gone
Cause heaven knows that girl was born to two-step
And Texas women don't stay lonely long


It's a fact that women like the one I left
Can find somebody else, any time they want
It's a shame, but I'm afraid the one I love

Finally made it
I know this for sure
And you were so patient with me babe
I gotta say thank you

Seeing you in places you would never go
Small payback for the pain I caused
For all the ways that I did you wrong
I didn't hear from you 
Not a fucking thing from you 
Laying here in bed thinking about her
Loudest silence that I ever heard


Yeah
People say they gon' change but it never happens
And we go back to old ways and old habits
A nigga just so used to getting reprimanded
I had to hear the silence just to understand it 


Since then a nigga changed so much 
What will I do with the pieces of you? 
I just need one more chance, one more chance 
I gotta get my baby back
Now all I have is fragments of your heart
Since you been gone it's been I've ever got

Falling way back deep in love so involuntary
All you needed was my trust
Now you got it baby
And now that I got it
I ain't gonna lose it

I said I rarely dream in color but 
And every brother ain't a brother but 
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish 
To give her everything's my dying wish 
Role play, she plays the mannequin 
Raising my hand, teacher says ""Not again"" 
The sun is up, but I feel down again 
On just one hand, I can count all my friends 


The understudy for the star, the show must go on
I'm a beast on a leash, I'm towed from the lawn
Another notch in my belt, the food's getting scarce
Another notch in my belt, she shakes up the stairs
Drink liquid confidence, tequila's our defense
Get rid of this tense and makes life make sense
As I come off the fence and break through defense
Anxiety is on the ropes and it's gettin' intense


Population gettin' tired now 
Everybody wants inspired now 
Racist emails fire out 
We did it in the dark, it's coming out 
The world is crazy and I cannot sleep but 
Melatonin good enough to eat but 
I read the paper so that I can see what 
I'd rather stay indoors and make a beat but 


My mother said a lot of wise words to me
Her Bible was like her toolie, peasy-headed and unruly
I made her think she got to me
Following the trail of reefer
And niggas talking through speakers
Fattest laces through my sneakers
The rappers ere ghetto preachers
Thought I had it so I tried it, for so long I would just hide it
Then I made the crowds say ""Hoo!""
And saw them all get excited
I was hooked, I couldn't shake it
The more I got, I would take it
Couldn't sleep andcouldn't eat
But this life, I would not forsake it


I said I really dream in color now 
And every brother ain't a brother now 
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish 
To give her everything my dying wish 


So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one


This one's for good girls that all gone bad 
This one I'm taking when I feel sad 
This one I'm taking to make me strong 
This one I'm taking so that I'll live long 
This one I'm taking to make me smile 
This one I'm taking to make life worthwhile 
This one and that one and those and these 
I just want to sleep, I want to be at ease

"It's true that all the men you knew
Were dealers who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
Well, I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of
Anyone who's reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You'll find he did not leave you very much
No, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild he'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
Just some Holy Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your windowsill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love, your warmth and your shelter
And then taking from his wallet an old schedule of trains
He'll say, ""I told you when I came I was a stranger""
""I told you when I came I was a stranger""

Ah, but now another stranger seems to want you
To ignore his dreams, as though they were the burden of some other
You've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the song he sings for shelter

Well, you hate to watch another tired man lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the Holy Game of Poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
And now suddenly you look a little older
Yeah, suddenly you feel a little older

Well, you tell him to come in, sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open, you cannot close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens, do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It's you my love, you who are the stranger

Now, while I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting
For, I think it's time to board another
Please understand I never had a secret chart to get me
To the heart of this, or any other matter
When he talks like this, you don't know what he's after
Yes, he speaks like this, you don't know what he's after

Ah, let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was that stranger
And you say, ""OK, the bridge, or someplace later""

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You'll find he did not leave you very much
No, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching
For the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
Yeah, just some Joseph looking for a manger

And leaning on your windowsill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love, your warmth and your shelte

Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by
They shouldn't have tried me
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter
Eat a dick, biyotch mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
Just sell me your soul, and live the life 


I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
Mug niggas, slug niggas for the fame life
Laced with game, practice on takin' pain
Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain
Street smart, proficient, intelligent
And keep suckers hittin' 'til snitches start smellin' it
Movin' niggas with telekinesis
Keepin' Channel 7 at work, filmin' different features
Leadin' niggas to an early death with they head blown
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
And hope niggas got punished
Kidnapped, jacked in the back with MAC's to they neck, rappers waitin to get done in
Back  we tossed his ass out
M.O.B. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin' G
Now the next generation's lookin' up to me like Cedric told em 


Walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
2 shots rang from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify
His family, sheeit, ain't nothing left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Why, I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Fly, I won't touch down 'til I see Tijuana
Set up shop selling them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success, I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
But cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star


Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue cause I plan on, shuttin' shit down
Born soldier, fucked 'em up with a MAC-fo'
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucka free
Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd 'til I bucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
With a team and clientele on my mothafuckin' dick
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin' riches
By givin' stitches, the life as a ghetto star


When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them

There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell
Jury found him guilty

She was down and he was up
Had a gun in his hand
Bullets started flying everywhere
People start to scream
Big man lyin' on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been


But it was all in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free




I got to break out
Out of here




Heartbeats, they were racing
Freedom, he was chasin'
Spotlights, sirens
Rifles firing
But he made it out...

Cranking up a country song
Heaven right by your side
And a Saturday night barely hanging on
Sun shining through the stained glass
Humming ""Just As I Am""
I'm praying that feeling would last
That feeling that saves you
Makes you wanna raise your hands

Up in the mud and the buck the way we did

We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row


I had my first taste of beer
My first taste of a broken heart
There were good times, there were tears
But every red dirt memory left a mark
Like the words written there in red
Like the streets that are made of gold
Where we always bowed our heads, where mama saved our seats
And Jesus saved our souls

Rinse it off like candy rain

I guess that's why they call it God's country


I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia, but he didn't stick around
This is God's country


We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country 


I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country 



God's country


I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country 


I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country 
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine

"I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam
He said is my country just a little off track
Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back
But, it's better than not coming back at all
Many a good man I saw fall
And even now, every time I dream
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream

Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
My children love me , but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, it don't mean nothin', it don't mean nothin'
Drive on

I remember one night, Tex and me
Rappelled in on a hot L.Z
We had our 16's on rock and roll
But, with all that fire, was scared and cold
We were crazy, we were wild
And I have seen the tiger smile
I spit in a bamboo viper's face
And I'd be dead, but by God's grace

Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
My children love me , but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, it don't mean nothin', it don't mean nothin'
Drive on

It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain
And nobody tried to be John Wayne
I came home, but Tex did not
And I can't talk about the hit he got
I got a little limp now when I walk
And I got a little tremolo when I talk
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
""You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam""

Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
My children love me , but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man
Drive on, it don't mean nothin', it don't mean nothin'
Drive on

Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded


 Honestly, you probably shouldn't listen to a word I say
'Cause girl, I feel like I've been dizzy for days
Would you do it if I asked you to stay
Or would you tell me it's a little too late?
'Cause if it is I'd be happy to fade
Said I'd pick a better time and a place, yeah
But if it's not and you still got monsters
My demons would be happy to play
Just look at everyone's faces, you know that they faded
Always escaping, I did too much taking
Now when you say shit, it feels it's nothin' like
When I had you, girl, at least I had somethin' right
Deep like the ocean, seizing the moment
My cards are showing


Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded


And I don't mean to put on the pressure
But if you ever wanna do it to me again
I probably would let ya
And I know it's a little bit extra
To say that I'm messed up's an understatement
It's time that I let go, I'm done with hatin'
I hear music having me blasting
Life is steadily passing, baby, I'm not exaggeratin'
So I'ma keep deep diving
Just to see you, where you hidin'?
And if you aren't in the sea
I just wait until I dream just to see if I can find you


Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me

I wanna dedicate this one to Robert ""Yummy"" Sandifer
And all other lil' Young Niggas that's in a rush to be gangstas


As a Young nigga, I'm almost runnin' in the wind
Give anything, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies
'Til them niggas started slangin', now they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin' to make a million, can you blame me?
With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
Someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin'
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin' with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, though it's bad
But all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
As young niggas


He's the kind of G like everybody knows

He's always G'd up, from head to toe

Always got it blown like Al Capone

He's the downest G I've ever known


Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin' high
My neighborhood was full of drive-bys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
Let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
Me against the world stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitches cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play
But that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga


He's the kind of G like everybody knows

He's always G'd up, from head to toe

Always got it blown like Al Capone

He's the downest G I've ever known


I'm tellin' you—to be young, have your brains and have every limb and all that—yo, y'all niggas don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
And peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you begin your life
You dumb nigga


Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein' somethin'
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin
Tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
And I will even if it kills me, my Young Niggas
Break away from these dumb niggas
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come figure
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin'
Puttin' niggas in a casket, murdered for hangin'
At the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin'
Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
The epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin' hopeless, where
More and more brothers givin' up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
And I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggas


He's the kind of G like everybody knows

He's always G'd up, from head to toe

Always got it blown like Al Capone

He's the downest G I've ever known
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
He always got it blown like Al Capone
He's the downest G I've ever known


This go out to the young thugs, the have-nots 
Little bad motherfuckers from the block 
Them niggas that's thirteen and fourteen
Drivin' Cadillacs, Benzes and shit 
Young motherfuckin' hustlers 
Stay strong nigga
You could be a fuckin' accountant, not a dope dealer
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Fuck around and, you pimpin' out here
You could be a lawyer 
Niggas gotta get they priorities straight

Really doe.. Young Niggas.. little RahRah
 Especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy

The sun's gone up and down that many times
Since we last loved Gloria
I've been sharing love with women of kinds

But when summer ends and leaves start dying
You won't see robin crying
He knows where the sun is hiding
To another nest he's flying

You gave me reason now watch me roam
But the road I'm on, gal, won't run me home

Hear my words Gloria
They're echoing from mountains with a cry
Hear my words Gloria
You'll find them, gal, reflecting off the sky

Just feel it in the cold wind blowing
Hear it from the river's flowing
Nowhere in the mind that's growing
See 'cause the cards that's showing

You gave me reason now watch me roam
But the road I'm on, gal, won't run me home

Now if you're wondering Gloria
I''ve more than just a memory in the cold
If you're wondering Gloria
I'll always be the keeper of my soul

Well, just loving you I took my chances
Somehow I don't want the answers
I'll go along my way without you

Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so goddamn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
 I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
 Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast

Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya

Let me die as I rest in peace, deep

Run for cover and return fire

But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops

Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something
Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping
People on the street, they panic and start running

Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming

Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for

'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor

Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
And these fuckers are laughing their way to the bank
Cashing the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect

For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
In the living room laughing like, ""What did he say?""


Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen
Amen


In my living room watching but I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions

Ten years old, it's something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me

Do you see the soldiers that are out, today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up, yesterday

There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show

My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine on the back
He hand-wrote a quote, inside
""When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die""

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like ""What did he say?""


Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen
Amen

And when it rains, it fuckin' pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the mess, I think I like it


So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth savin'
So come rain on my parade


I think we're doomed

And now, there's no way back

This is your time
Your life's flashing before your eyes
And soon enough you will realize that this is goodbye
But what if I gave you a chance?
You just have to sell your soul


Look around, what do you see?
The choices you never had the guts to make
I'm sorry you never could be, the man that you wanted
But regret is wasted on me!


I can feel air inside my lungs again
All because of you
I can rebuild my life and start again
All because of you


This feeling's amazing, I know
But be careful, you know not what you wish for
Granted life again but now you've cheated death
There's nowhere to run when you run from yourself!
But fear not for as long as you live you are mine
And even in death you will find
You've lived with regret for so long but now is your chance to change what has been wrong!


I can feel air inside my lungs again
All because of you
I can rebuild my life and start again
All because of you


And I know that my destiny wasn't written in the stars
It was just a part of satellites and it's all because of you
And it's all because of you!
Don't ever trust the devil, bitch!
I never wanted this

I should have know my time was up


I can't feel air inside my lungs, I'm dead...
All because of, you!
All because of you...


I can't feel air inside my lungs, I'm dead!

Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music
A trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she's got a coke feel cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills
No deal, put her on her feet, toenails
Them vampires, them bloodsuckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it 'bout it, we rowdy rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm 'bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss
Slip-ons get slipped off

We smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass, making it last
Walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, making 'em crash
Took in a section ain't giving it back
Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life
An insight to my trill life

I shouldn't wake you over the furnace
But I should swear to someone you'd have loved every note

So dream a good one tonight
I'll listen to the bad ones when they come
Get up in my ear 'til I hear every word
Every turn of your tongue, I will tighten my grip


No one could tell even if I fell one hundred stories straight down, down, down
No one could tell even if I fell one hundred stories down


I was getting bored with hurting myself
If you fall down enough
Well, soon enough you will find hell
It can't be as, as pretty as we hoped it would be
It's not even warm there, not even ten degrees


This bed is too big to sleep in
And I'm dying just to feel you breathe
You couldn't see across the ocean

In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen

They killed us in our tepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the firesticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun

They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share

I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the mornin'
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen

And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk about Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
Like the Astrodome
And the first tepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me

""Your life has been marked by considerable pain..
Do you think you'll ever get to the point where you can live
A normal, happy life?""

No, but.. I.. I'm goin' for it.. I'm tryin' for it
And until then..I have to make the life that I do live
As happy as I can and try to do the best with what I have
Do.. you know, live the best life I can live
Be as happy as I can be.. nothing is perfect for anybody
I don't think

Thug for life, feel me? 
I know it seems hard sometimes, but..
Remember one thing..
To every dark night, there's a bright day after that
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
So no matter how hard it get, stick you chest out, keep your head up..
And handle it!
Hold on..
I'll catch y'all up in the next life
We're in traffic

Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to 'em bet
It's all good, uhh


I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And driveby's robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin' me down
And facing me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on


I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on


There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin' getting high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on


I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on


I know them ain't tears coming down your face
When it's on it's on but wipe your eyes
In this world only the strong survive y'know
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
Welfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, carjackings
Yeah we got problems but believe me when I tell you
Things always get better God don't like ugly
And God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
God bless the child that can hold his own
Y'know? You got to stand strong
And when these busters try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face tell em hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop, Hmmm
Hold on, and be strong, this here is Black Man


If you don't never leave nothin', learn one thing
It don't stop, til the casket drop
Hold on

He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would hear
Junior sighed as his hands reached out to the sky
Junior cried the day that his best friend died

""My son ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee""


Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander


At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia


Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend amongst mortal men


King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria


By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia


Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a God amongst mortal men


A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia


Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on


The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory


Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon

In the acceptance of all that living brings

And though our efforts resemble the fluctuating tide

How you gonna take this? like a man or a bitch?
You gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
Man, I stack chips and I unload clips
After 3 summers in the jail I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
You know me, started sellin' leak in the yard
Yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
Big as hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
Damm dog, you been in here that long?
You could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
A convo is only three words, ""yo what up""
You ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
And you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After witnesses disappear on the strength of they team
I'm hard as hell to get along wit' so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in bible paper - blowin' the lah
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
And when I shot you in New York why would I box you now?
If I catch you going to sick call I'm'a ox you down
Niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
In here a gemstar is like a nine milli chrome
It's similar, in fact they'll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home


You got blown over the jack? 
Your man ran when you got clapped? 
Rockin' a vest with no gat? 
You only a thug when you rap? 
Niggas juxed you for your track? 
You ran to other thugs to get it back? 
Niggas ran off with your packs? 
If you ain't bustin' ya gat 


You'd call me Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box so much it seems like I'm visitin' pop-ulation
When I walk by, niggas like ""Fifty don't play son""
""yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga...""
Max out, I'm goin' straight for the Glock
Bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
The things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
Down goes the window....out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' track meet
Some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
Some get it in the foot, bleed all over their Air Max
Nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
It's extortion, it happens in the hood often
Claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
Cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit cause I stay on that block shit
That 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
See the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
Ya'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
Leave with your blood on my mink in the drop six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this

It was getting late so I tagged along, couldn't let them walk alone
I followed them up some greasy steps to a rooftop in the sky
No walls around just a sea of stars, my throat was getting dry

Everyone could feel the heat that's why we all disrobed
Our clothes and inhibitions went off flying 'cross the globe
Dancing crazy getting loose and closer to the edge
I could feel my blood was up and it was pounding in my head

So there I was, just me and the girls
Under the moonlight on the top of the world

As things were dying down we retreated from the precipice
I lay beside the most beautiful girl in the universe
Her name was Venus in Heaven
She fed me rice and offered me wine
I accepted ambrosia and nectar
From an amber goddess
I collapsed between the thighs of Morpheus
Next thing I felt was a sharp pain of sunrise
My mouth was open and full of rice
As I managed to prize open one of my eyes
I saw Luigi the cockroach carry off his prize
And there lay Venus still sprawled out and naked for sure
But not quite what she was the night before
I made my excuses and left through the door
Stepped into space at the twentieth floor
And that's why I don't like heights no more

"Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin' and plenty pleasin'
Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin'

Allow me to take you back and attempt
To satisfy my curiousity
Please tell me where to place the blame
The responsibility for the change, very strange

Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin' and plenty pleasin'
Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin'

I've been thinkin' about
The good times we shared
Just getting high from the memory
You were always there, so willing to care
Now you're gone, I'm alone

Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin' and plenty pleasin'
Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin'

Flash back, a few years in time
Maybe then you will find
That the reason for the pleasin' was the teasin'

Now come on, get off and get used to it, my dear
Let the music possess you
And make love to your ears

Come on back, come on back
My sweet sexy love
Come on back, sweet love

Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin' and plenty pleasin'
Makin' love and dance was all we'd do
A little teasin'

Broken homes, fighting brothers
Drugs sold upon the streets
Terrorism and alcoholism
These selfish motives guide the world
Weeping mothers, woah, crying fathers
What has this world come to?


They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing?
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?
They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?


Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Singing to the people
Let's live until we die


Grew up for business
I'll do whatever it takes
Don't work a day unless you're paid
One night stands and broken hearts
We forgot how to love
I shoot 'em up and take 'em down
I don't bleed on my ground


They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing?
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?

I'm sittin' on my porch, watching the law
As they ride past in they patrol cars
So tell me why I feel like the enemy
They're supposed to be here protectin' me
I might have went too far
Helping to contribute to making they job hard
Serving fiends like these people ain't no enemy
I can't believe I'm out here killing my community
If you knew how far I came 
From where I am and where I used to be 
Don't want it, you can tell by the look at me
This gangsta life ain't no longer in me


And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby, you gotta believe me


I know there's things I could've changed, girl
I know there's things I could've done a lot better
Instead I'm in the streets tryin' to make that cheddar
Thinking in my mind that you gon' be there forever
I know I could've let it all go 
But I was thinking it would make life better
Instead I'm sittin' in this cell, writing this letter
Thought I wouldn't get caught ‘cause I was way too clever
I learned there's no one to catch you when you're fallin'
And they'll be no one to hear you when you're callin'
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin'
While you're starvin' and you're hearing bugs crawlin'?
Reminiscing on them days you was walkin'
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossin'
Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin
Something you see too often


And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law

Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law

… Through the spot
Everyday was like a beef to me
Little nigga said he’d make it hot
You don’t wanna draw heat with me
I got niggas that’ll run up in your spot
Cooly nigga, you don’t really want beef
I’m Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
My bitch now tryna comfort me
And baby I wonder, baby I wonder


Uh, buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah, uh
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard-headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat? 
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak 
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck
Hitta chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats
I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back


And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?


It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what's up blood clots?
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip...


And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?


I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
Baby I wonder, baby I wonder


And I wonder, as I'm laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?
And I wonder, as I'm laying down in bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

I want to hold the hand inside you
I want to take a breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there


Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart


Fade into you

I think it's strange you never knew

Beer battered chicken, sweet ice tea
Night crawlers, crickets and a Zebco 33
Old Glory waving at you
As you're driving by the court house
And it's just another day in Heaven South


A little country angel like you've never seen
Took a pair of scissors to a pair of jeans
You pick her up on Friday
And you pucker up and kiss her on the mouth
And it's just another day in Heaven South


Drive down Main Street and everybody's there
Subwoofers booming like cannons in a square
Sign says ""no cruising"" but nobody cares
I got a girl to put my arm around
It's just another day in Heaven South


Oh, oh, oh
It's just another day in Heaven South
Oh, oh, oh


There's a bunch of lawn chairs in the living room
There's a UFC fight on pay per view
Gonna thaw out deer steaks, got fireworks for afterwards tonight
Gotta make a little run for beer and ice


Down on Main Street and everybody's there

Turn on the news you'd think the world ain't got a prayer
If you turn it off and look around
It's just another day in Heaven South

Farmer on a tractor, kids on a bus

The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The trumps of diesels hammer down
In the oily sea, the killing ground


Knuckles white, eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chicken's lair
A hound of Hell and the Devil don't care


Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting
For all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep


Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when
The lethal silver fish will fly
The boat will shiver, men will die


A cast of millions, a part to play
Killer, victim or fool for a day?
Obeying an order, men have to die
Us or them, a well rehearsed lie




The lifeboat's shattered, the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to Davy Jones
Every man for himself, you're on your own


The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
Stern tubes ready, aim and fire
They can pin some medal on your chest
But in two more weeks, dead like the rest




Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare

That anchorman
Says they're fighting again somewhere in the Middle East
The world prays for peace
There's a single mom
Just got laid off went and lost her job to some foreign hands
In some far away land


Last night in Oklahoma, some twister took thirteen
And they're prayin', they find the missin' three
God must be busy


That highway sign
Went from slow ahead to traffic's dead
Thought it couldn't get worse
Then that Amber alert
They say she's four, Colorado plates, headed out of state in a Chevy van
It's hard to understand


You can see it in the faces, of all those highway strangers
They're prayin' that God keeps girl from danger
God must be busy


And I know in the big picture, I'm just a speck of sand
And God's got better things to do, than to look out for one man
I know He's heard my prayers, 'cause He hears everything
He just ain't answered back, or He'd bring you back to me
God must be busy


That evenin' news
Ain't much changed, pretty much the same since I left home
Yeah, that war's still on
They found that little girl
She was soaking wet, half scared to death on the side of some road
Them prayers work you know


And the blood and the crips are at it, and there's a killer drought down south
And old folks can't afford the drugs, they can't live without
God must be busy


And I know in the big picture, I'm just a speck of sand

Dead feelings are cool, down lower I sink

Damn, who did I forget?


I'm a soulja, daddy was a soulja
Strong in the struggle
Must contend so it's on
Raised in a house full of bad motherfuckers
Mad motherfuckers
Never had so we grab from the stacked motherfuckers
Now they know me, the homies
Raised by some crazed ass well payed OG's
Ah shit! Pulled up in a benzy, snatch
The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail
Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit
Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it
To get specific: If the shoe fits, then kick it
It's for the gifted, pump your fist if you wit it
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit
Now they wanna ban me 
All I wanted to be was a soulja
Bang bang boogie, it's a stick up
Quit now, nigga, eat a dick up
Huh, I'm representin'

That bucket of bolts in the driveway
It's old but it's still fast
And the weeds out in the front yard
When they're green, they look like grass
And this house we got
Well, it sure could use a couple shingles and a can of paint
But looking on the bright side
We're dry every time it rains


Yeah, I'm kicked back on the front porch
Drinking up this sunset
We ain't got a whole lot
But we got what we need
Yeah, I'm smiling cause I've been blessed
Sipping on the good stuff
This ain't a glass half empty thing
It's a half full Dixie cup


Kids chasing around that old dog
Being loud and dragging out toys
But you're missing out on a sweet sound
If all you hear is noise
And their mama sitting here beside me
Laughs and says, ain't it funny
Some people I know, well, they're flat broke
Cause all they got is money




Some days I fall by the wayside
And let the devil have his way
He puts a hole in my cup
But this ain't one of those days, no




Yeah, I'm smiling cause I've been blessed
I'm sipping on the good stuff
Hey, this ain't a glass half empty thing
It's a half full Dixie cup

"A lonely spot I know where no man will go
Where the shadows have all the room
I was riding free on that old S-P
Humming a southern tune
When a man came along made me hush my song
Kicked me off away out there

As she pulled out of sight I turned to the right
The left and everywhere
All I could see was a cactus tree
A prairie dog playing there
I watched the prairie dog eat on the tumbleweed
That's his home away out there

Ee oo ee dle dee dee ho oo lay dee ee dee
Ee oo ee dle dee dee ho ho lay dee ee dee

Then I threw down my load in the desert road
Rested my weary legs too
Watched the sinking sun make the tall shadows run
Across that barren plain
Then I hummed a tune to the rising moon
He gets lonesome way out there

Then I closed my eyes to the starlit skies
Lost myself in dreams
I dreamed the desert sand was a milk-and-honey land
Then I awoke with the dawn
There's a train coming back on the one-way track
Going to take me away from here

Ee oo ee dle dee dee ho oo lay dee ee dee
Ee oo ee dle dee dee ho ho lay dee ee dee

We kneel to the Gods of corporation
We eat when we're full and we hoard all the rest

We shrug shoulders and create yet another -ism
We dissuade our young from using their imagination
We avert our eyes from this our very own manifestation

Only in my dreams before

Never turn your back on a friend
Cause you can count
Your real true friends on one hand
Through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you?

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in, so they say
In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one, right now

In a rooms full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall?
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to, it's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way, it does
Are we here for a reason?

It would be nice to know what happened
When we die, wouldn't it?

There are some who're wise
There are some who're born naive
I believe that there are some
That must have lived before, don't you?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not
An open and shut case

Extra sensory perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on
And travel through space and time?

You know I feel so elated
Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

You, don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around, it's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your friends might say
We'll meet up again some place someday
One day

Riconosco le scarpe
E parlo coi loro piedi
Senza chiedergli niente

Anche io ho un amico vero
Che mi resta vicino

È un fiasco di vino
L'amore mi accende il fuoco
Scorre dentro le vene
La vita diventa un gioco
Se mi vogliono bene

La verità
È nel mio cuore
Non la senti
Per il rumore

La verità
Me la son fumata
Guarda il giallocome brucia
Le mie dita

E' così facile rotolare
Senza un'ancora buona
Se affidi la tua vita al caso
O a un pò di fortuna
La barba mi fa sentire
Il padrone del mondo
Col re si può brindare
E raggiungere il fondo

E io sogno la stessa donna
Ormai da una vita
Vorrei potere ricordare se l'ho conosciuta..
Lei mi parla con voce dolce come di una mamma
Peccato che la sento solo nel fumare una canna

La verità
È nel mio cuore
Non la senti
Per il rumore

La verità
Me la son fumata
Guarda il giallocome brucia
Le mie dita

Ah! grazie!
Non si può
No non posso leggere il giornale sai
Lo so cosa fare
Sì lo so che tu lo sai
Parole scure troppo piccole sono per me
Non mi fido
Ma perchè tu non ti fidi dimmi
Io li raccolgo mi copro sotto
Quelle strane verità
Dormo, son felice
Sei felice
Dormo e dimentico
Tutto ciò che pesa su di me
Come quei milioni di parole, che
Puzzano di petrolio!
Dormo e son felice
In un bosco incantato
E voi stanchi restate
Su questo selciato
Tristi opachi senza profondità
Voi che siete la società
Ah ah ah ah

"Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed

Why won't you listen to me?
Is it so hard to understand?
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain, impending disaster
Souls crying, the Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?

Purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, Hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late

Come in and sit down here beside my bare wall

I've but moments to stay and my time I must watch

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos


Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight


They know that Santa's on his way;
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore

Please stay where you are, don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind


I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me


You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight

Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay

But I want to live and not just survive

Words come slow to me
Silence easily
But the world spins round and round
My heart is breaking
The mess I'm making

Every little beat of your heart
You're painting a picture of me
You put me on a pedestal I can't climb down
Every little beat of my own
Takes me further from you

And he follows you around
He gets his line right every time

You want to love so tenderly
And you know I’m worth it  I’m worth it

It's like I'm the Rikers and you the Island
We stuck together until the verdict
Big dreams in tiny windows, trapped behind bars, your love is murder
And I'd die just to come back as an angel and look over you
‘Cause I know what the most high got planned for us, more than mostly true
I stay close to you, spray clips, empty 50 at anybody is nothing
Many women that try me, none of them the wifey type
But they're looking for a husband, I guess that's what they're supposed to do
But I'm good, I'mma toast to you, because you with me in the trenches
So why I gotta cheat when I got a freak at home?
She my queen and my ho and my mistress
And she know how to split the dutch up, break the green up, roll up the leaf and clean up
Drive while I ride on enemies, rock the wheel with one hand and blow the heater
She a bad motherfucka, hot to def, so you know that I need her
If you know you're a bad bitch, put your hands up to this jam by Nas and Alicia


So all my real woman, throw your hands up

Looking for a better home
Got me, got me
Burning out a lightbulb
Cloudy, cloudy
Holding to a waste can
Yellow car, yellow car
Gather me inside there


Wake up, wake up
Nothing's gonna harm you
Glass wall, glass wall
Standing on the furniture
Little boy, little boy
Layin' in a sleeping bag
Watching, watching
Through the cracks in his eyelids

Feeding on the broken snow
Lost head, lost head
Staring down the orange juice
Alphabet, alphabet
Can't afford a telephone
Blackhole, blackhole
Nothing's gonna harm you

Let's get back to the beach
And Lucy you can let all your hair down
And lay out all your troubles for me
The smell of licorice in the air


Wooh, young dabber, young whipper snapper
I'm snapping on this beat
I'll let the claps come a kick it after, I'm tripping out
I think I feel the vibe start to kick in now
If you ain't on the island then you're missing out
She just wanna party with a young spade
You ain't rolling wit us, you'll be floating wit us one day
Shit is wavy
The ship is still sailing under thunder clouds

And when she pass me the weed
I was a natural fiend
When she came back
The same path had open and it close again
We making up and breaking up
It's time to hit these hoes again
The tip of her tongue, she thought it was love
She wanted to say it, I wanted to fuck
Now I'm stuck in this song, and it's burning me up
The secret sands we lay out
And you need a ring like you baed out
And I'm base out my main chick
You can't swim to me if you way out, but

And Lucy you can let all your hair down

And burry all your worries beside us
And lay out all your troubles for me
The smell of licorice in the air now, air now, air now...


You don't have to owe me one
You don't even have to call
Just know that we're the only ones
It's simpler after all
Don't be scared
All around I don't care

Fuck in the open air
And burry all your worries beside us
And lay out all your troubles for me

But at Max's Kansas City we won


We all shot the shit at the bar
With Johnny O' Toole and his scar
And then old Clive Davis said
He's surely gonna make us a star
I'm going to make you a star
Just the way you are


But with all his style
I could see in his eyes
That we is going on trial
And it was no surprize

As usual time would tell
But some bitch in the choir
Throw water on the fires of hell
She loved to show and tell
Lord, she loved to tell


But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
And it was no surprize

Vaccinate your ass with your phonograph needle


I say look here

You scratch like you need calamine
Flamingo boots, soles a creaking
Still in love and Puerto Rican too
Riding on wheels of hell
Smoking our axle grease
Oh, the backstage is rocking
And we're copping from the local police
That's right, the local police
Or the justice of peace

I found refuge on a twin bed of this three-star hotel

Static, Rachel talks to Phoebe about the cat that smells

A mental weakness can throw you out of balance
Listen, respect each other

It's not too late for mercy

Left to atone their social blunders
If you gun down the messenger
You guarantee that he will be made
Into a saint

We will fight
When liberty seems out of reach

"Well I'm sitting in church
In an old wooden chair
I knew nobody
Would look for me there
. . . Sorrow and pity
. . . Rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothing
Anyone's eyes

Once I had pretty girls
Did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Snowflakes are falling
Around my head
Lord have mercy
It feel heavy like lead
. . . I been hit too hard
. . . Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch

Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Loneliness
Got a mind of its own
The more people around
The more you feel alone
. . . I'm chained to the earth
. . . Like a silent slave
Trying to break free
Out of death's dark cave

Once I had a pretty girl
Done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Boys in the street
Beginning to play
Girls like birds
Flying away
. . . I'm carrying the roses
. . . That were given to me
And I'm thinking about paradise
Wondering what it might be

Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Go over to London
Maybe gay Paree
Follow the river
You get to the sea
. . . I was hoping we could drink from
. . . Life's clear streams
I was hoping we could dream
Life's pleasant dreams

Once I had a pretty girl
But she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Well the weak get weaker
And the strong stay strong
The train keeps rolling
All night long
. . . She looked at me
. . . With an irresistible glance
With a smile
That could make all the planets dance

Once I had a pretty girl
She did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

My house is on fire
Burning to the skies
I thought the rain clouds
But the clouds passed by
. . . When I'm gone
. . . You'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame

Once I had a pretty girl
But she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

I don't know

"Angel, si dice in giro
Che vivi come un gatto
Angel, che cos'hai fatto
Perchè quel fiato corto
Ma non lo vedi
Sei una sirena ma non ami il mare
Non sai che fare
Se vivere o morire
Angel, lui se n'è andato
E il tempo si è fermato
Angel, non hai capito
Che il gioco era finito
Tu che eri stella
Adesso rosa senza spine tu
Non farti male
Non spegnerti nel blu

Basta poco, per ricominciare
Basta poco, la musica del mare
Basta poco, ma è importante
Quel minuto per diventare grande
Non cambiare, non lasciarti andare

Angel, come nessuna
Più chiara della luna
Angel, negli occhi scuri
Soltanto sguardi duri
Io qui per caso
Ma forse un angelo ha guardato giù;
E questa notte
Quell'angelo sei tu

Basta poco, per ricominciare
Basta poco, la musica del mare
Basta poco, ma è importante
Quel minuto per diventare grande
Non cambiare, non lasciarti andare
Non cambiare, non lasciarti andare

Now one look in that direction
And everything starts to hurt
Is this thing cursed?

And everytime my boat's about tits up
That goddamn thing is near

And now the city cut my water
And it's all I have to drink


Is this thing cursed?
If it is then I'm the jerk
Who keeps on hanging around
When I simply should just burn it to the ground
Maybe it's some kind of spell
That I've been living under
Collecting coins found near a nightmare wishing well

Coldest regards signed my name and sealed the card
Tried to leave it all behind me and almost blew up in my car

To see what I could see
And I saw the ladies dancing
An I guess that they saw me
Neither did I vanquish, or surrender to desire
Was just more fuel on the fire

I’ve heard form follows function
And I think that must be true
Especially when you think of
What the female form will do
Its lines and shapes are everywhere
As if they follow me
Repeating my own longing in everything I see

Star of happiness, star of love
Lead us to the shore
That only women hold the promise of
Men would give them money
And men would give them gold
And shower them with promises
Of luxury untold
And make their vessels of creation
The temples of our souls
Ohhhhh let my people go

Sea of loneliness, sea of love
Carry me upon your endless depths
And bear my heart above
For I would give her money
And I would give her jewels
And lead her to the palace my imagination rules
And fashion from her nakedness
The innocence that’s gone
Gone as the time she’s given the suffering of fools

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came


I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came




I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came


And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

"I had dreams and crazy schemes
Never felt this way before
I had days when I god raged
Never felt like this before
Endless nights that end in flights
Now I feel love
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never more than now
Paralysed by vicious lies
Never felt this way before
Seen hope die and grown men cry
Never felt like this before
Shed lonely tears and heartfelt fears
Now I feel love
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now
A thing of beauty
Lasts forever
Stretches through all time
Every endeavour
No matter how hard
They might try
To build you up
And to bleed you dry
Never lose love. Never
Never lose love. Never
Ever, ever, ever
Never. Never. Never more than now
Never. Never. Never more than now

Got my guns and magazines
Ending up in front of me
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see


Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more


I go to war to my heart stop, niggas ain't listening
Get the thumping and the dumping at your newborn's christening
Tell your homie, tell his homies, he 'gon need more homies
Ain't this a bitch I got the extended clip right on me
And my diamonds on my neck, I dare a nigga to scheme on it
The Ruger on deck, it's hard to miss with the beam on it
I'll give your ass a permanent nap-- sing you a lullabye
I got money to run, so fuck an alibi


Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more


Yeah, I believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop I'm on it
Morning or the night, I spot-cha I gotcha
Wake up cuffed to your bed, cops asking 'who shot-cha'
As the world turns,  will be learned
The hollow tips burnin and I ain't concerned if I ain't hit
Than I ain't hit, so a nigga don't really give a shit
You know who you fucking with
Come through dump more than a clip
Niggas be on some stupid shit
Till they get hit, ain't that a bitch?


K-I double, shot gun barrel double
I always run a couple and I move 'em on a double
Racks in the duffel, Mac with the muzzle
Makin' circles in you, all black like a tunnel
I only know how to hustle, can't stay outta trouble
I got a big gun, mutha-fuckers scuffle

FUCK NO! Pimp zone, Rida gang, you already fuckin' know

You scuff these I’ll scar your face, buck fifty, nigga
Been fucking with them pigs, you a guinea niggu
And you always begging, you's a ''give me'' nigga

Cassadaga, oh yeah, that's where you're going to find the center of energy
And they've got those in Arizona too
You know, there's, I know that there's wonderful grounds that have vortexes
That you might be interested in going to
And then go to Nevada. And then go to California
And then come south and go back through Arizona
And go through Texas. You know what I'm saying?
Getting rid of the old feelings of the old ways of thinking
And, you know, it's kind of like with people and the tarot cards
Just because you get the Death card doesn't mean death or dying
It means transformation. It means changing things around and starting something new
Cause I was pulling in on a, on a dog or companion
Somehow I get the impression that you're almost a little afraid to start the trip
It doesn't have to be a straight line happy face
But make kind of a happy face, I mean kind of a smile
Go up, up the east coast, but it's gonna be a circle
You know what I'm saying? It's gonna be a sloppy circle
Don't be afraid. You know, years and years and years ago, you know, you might
You might have come across some river and rock and the mountains or whatever
And then when you get there maybe you'll have the answers you seek

We have moved into a new era and life as we know it is changing
Your relationships, career, and location will all be subject with an energy
Allow me to share with you tips that will assist you during these new times

Don't give up hope on yourself, no
Just be patient about the fact that, be patient about how things are unfolding
Because psychically, you're less ... why are you afraid to start?
I think you should go
I think you should go
You know, plan ahead, pack the things that you think you're gonna need
And then just go
Cassadaga might be just a premonition of a place you're going to visit


Corporate or Colonial
The Movement is unstoppable
Like the body of a centerfold it spreads
To the counter-culture copyright
Get your revolution at a lower price
Or make believe and throw the fight, play dead
It's exploding bags, aerosol cans
Southbound buses, Peter Pan
They left it up to us again
I thought you knew the drill
It's kill or be killed

Future Markets, Holy Wars
Been tried ten thousand times before
If you think that God is keeping score, Hooray! 
For the freedom-fighting simulcast
The imminent and the aftermath
Draw another bloody bath to drain  
Like the polar icecaps centrifuge
First snowman built at the end of June
He slicks his hair for the interview, his fifteen-minute fame
Would you agree times have changed?

You smoking on a diet‚ I smoke‚ I get the highs
You smoking on a diet, while I get the high
Get  higher, and higher‚ and tower above the clouds
You  thought I was a spire, but I'm just a spider
And her pussy is so fire
I'm  hittin' and quittin', she callin' me sir
I'm hittin' and quittin'‚ she callin' me sir
She callin' me sir, so cool
You know what bird, I'm so cool
You  know what bird, you know
What I'm cooking just so sit and watch
Watch me stir, you watch me stir
Then I finna hit up the burbs and sitting on bricks
Watching slow mixing take your turn, not hittin' the curb
While I'm slumped is what you heard, but I just sit and slurp
And you know just-j-j-just, just watch-n-n-hing you
You know you prolly learn
Never had no exes, just just bitches deep to exit
And right before I exit, she on her knees I let her bless it
DM in a second 
I don't even read the message 


Watch the time go by, all I wanna do is get h-i-igh
Smoke blunts in my r-i-ide, turn the music up, I like the v-i-i-bes
I'm fine, you should worry about yourself every once in awhile
Cracking a smile while I cut myself
Sometimes it feels like nothing help
And that prescription take the pain away
I'm taking acid if it rain today
Watch the clouds while I waste away
Dripping out the sink
No one ever knows what I'm sipping out my drink

Of the included and those of us who are excluded

With the wild life wanted to blend but then again
With them satellites they sucking us in we being tracked
So many got chips in they back they blindfold

Cursed with that ESP I seen they hold papa for a PS3 so is it me
Or majority wanna be slaves
They don't wanna behave but they wanna be saved praise the Lord
Moving on they own accord too content to implement a sharp in they sword so all aboard
Bruised by the height of recession hunger scarce in fears by the vice and infections
I'm aware of the war going on this world we can't escape from
We can run but we can't hide forever
Its deep the system got the masters asleep
Religion mean to rely on they supply and deceit they putting chemicals in food we eat
Polluting the waters it cause slaughter to sheep we the meek
And money ain't worth what its printed on

Its flying on the same line I'm trying to do business on
I guess they applying what they learned from the Pentagon

I'm takin' my lawyer the whole briefcase 
Makin' a play in the police face

When they played your new shit
I was like, ""No, DJ""

Man, y'all not in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
Y’all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I
Fuck the opp, no competitor
Got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that’s the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil nigga
This shit regular, G5s all in my backyard
Sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed
Now my pockets holding big protein
Big, big protein 
I leveled up past Fab Five
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Playin’ with me get you chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied
They didn’t fall for it, strategize
Switch the flow 'cause they know niggas like identity theft
Oh, you got like me? 
Oh, you pop like me? 
Mask keep a nigga 
Huh, swag keep a nigga 
Huh, tags on my wall

You said we'll never make a difference
Maybe this battle is to fight indifference

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck

Will we fight for nothing if not our lives?

Only he could let things get so dire
All the messengers found knives in their backs
Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire

Hook :
Hey girl
I see you standin next to him
And i can tell you ain't happy...
You rather be on the side of the club
Ballin' out with a niggah like me...
I can see you imaginin' those thoughts in your head
By the way your staring'...
I'll help your fantasies come true
All you gotta do is look me in my eyes
Look me in my eyes
Ill take you to that place
All i ask is look me in my eyes
Look me in my eyes
Baby look me in my eyes

Verse 1 :
What it do mama they call me young blast
And i couldn't help but stop soon as i roll past yah...
I see your pretty face,you ain't supposed to frown
Then whose your man,anywaise im gonna hold you down...
And i dont brag but he ain't fly like me
He ain't loyal,by your side,down to ride like me...
Now look around ain't no guys like me
You can look into my eyes and see
Im a playa for real...

Chorus :
Look me in my eyes
Ill take you to that place
All i ask is look me in my eyes
Look me in my eyes

Verse 2 :

You know im watchin' you...

So tell me whats from stopping you...
Im all the things that your man can't be
Down to do it all, fulfill your fantasy...
I need a freak down in late night creek
Hop up in the coupe,then we cruise throught the streets...
Ride to the telly then its straight to the suite
Turn the lights low and then its straight to the sheets...
Your man bumpin you dont need that mess
All i need is one night let me ease that stress...
Here runnin' game ma' i ain't got a lot of you
Akon sing the hook tell her what she gotta do



Verse 3 :
So what i gotta do to take you home?
We ballin' out in the club buyin' shots of patrone...
Rake you to that place where we can escape,alone
Turn of the side-kicks,two-ways and phones...
So whats it gon' be?
Its either him or me...
When you ready shorty ill be in the v.i.p
We livin' good baby rollin' in cash
Chunk your man a deuce tell him that your rollin with blast

He held his breath to hold your hand
To walk the stair steps in pairs
Climbing up a slippery slope
I'm in love, love I hope


Don't go home, Angelina
Stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found


He kissed you quick, feeling weird
Lonely leered, and disappeared
This is such a simple place
The passing time can't erase


Don't go home, Angelina
Paint tomorrow blue


Day breaks but every morning when he wakes he thinks of you


I'm alone, but that's okay
I don't mind most of the time
I don't feel afraid to die
She was here, passing by


Don't go home, Angelina

I get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really, they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
I thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winters spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door-knocker, down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father, you just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa
I really need a break, could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label
I go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal


First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up


The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes, yeah
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes


Alright
Spirit's working now


I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime
In high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass
Send my Tweet, fold my arms, twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know


First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up


The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes


Three verses, hell yes
I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the seams snappin', and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin'
'Til the dream happens, I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin' like
Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters
And black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin', knees bowed, tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings


Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream, may you never wake up


The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes,  ready or not, ready or not
Ready or not,  ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it will not wait another day
No more, no more 
The day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay
No more, no more 
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more

Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds


Self-righteousness is wearing thin

Heart bleeds but not for fellow men



I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone


So, how does it feel to know that
Someone's kid in the heart of America has blood on their hands
Fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain the lifestyle
That insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute
We aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers




Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
Generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies


Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man

Selfish agenda once again



I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone


All the way from the east to the west
We got this high society looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections
They never contributed a fucking thing
To the country they love to criticize


Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see, try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first

Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go 
Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know 
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code 
But back then couldn't get dro  'cause back then I was this broke 
That's why I got so many hustles , bruh man from the fifth floor 
What would you do in the middle of the winter
When the sun goes down and it gets cold?
Growin' up in a house with no stove
No doors, no walls, no windows
And my brother was always fresher
I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
Comin' up as a youngin', man, some nights I would vomit
I would throw up on myself 'cause I was so sick to my stomach

And I'm still here with the same team, nigga, stay down
Still here for the East Side, ain't a thang change but the bank 'count 
Hands high when I come 'round 'cause I'm killin' this shit nigga, hands down 
And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard 
Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe-to-toe with your whole squad 
With the soul of a soldier but even still, I don't want no parts
And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards
I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with an old bark 
Flow dumb, but I'm so smart, I compose art, call me Mozart
My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like, ""Oh God"" 
From a poor child to on top like a mohawk 
But I always knew I'd go far like a gas truck with no park 
So no applause , hold the applause
Just put your hand up if you know the song

There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me..

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close..
.. to the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely



Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family - love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine



Yeah.. yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh
Suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'mma lead you
And whatever's right, I'mma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

"I can remember stories
Those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings
Then tucked me in real tight

She turned my night light on
And kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions of perfect paradise

She told me everything
She said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him
We'd ride clean out of sight

She never said
That we would curse, cry and scream & lie
She never said that maybe
Someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise of fairy tales
Uh
No, uh, huh
Mmm, mmm

She spoke about happy endings
Of stories not like this
She said he'd slay all dragon
Defeat the evil prince

She said he'd come to save me
Swim through the stormy seas
I'd understand the story
It would be good for me

You never came to save me
You let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness
Alone in the cold

My story end as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise
No fairy tales
Yes

I don't look for pie up in the sky, baby
Need reality now
Said I don't feel the need to be pacified
Don't you try
Honey, I know you lied

You never came to save me
You let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness
Alone in the cold

I found no magic potion
No horse with wings to fly
I found the poison apple
My destiny to die

No royal kiss could save me
No magic spell to spin
My fantasy is over
My life must now begin

My story end as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise
No fairy tales

Eh
Hey, hey, eee
Mmm, mmm
Lord have mercy
Oooh
Oooh
Mmm
Oh Lord

I'm starin' at you and you look so good
I want it in the back seat and on top of the hood
And, I would do it all day if I could
Put a lumberjack on and give you the wood
You gotta man and that's understood
But I gotta girlfriend too, this a mutual move
So we do what grown folk do
She had a new lit candle on the table for two
A home cooked meal with the best soul food
I told her ""get on my plate, I'll just have you""
You can sit on my face after I say grace
Or I could just beat it up like I knew kung fu
We ended up in the kitchen with a sink full of dishes
Then I sat her on the stove like a pot when I hit it
She never want me to stop when I'm in it
Not even a minute until she finish
Then I don't


She works at the corner store
She is so bad, so bad, so...
I said ""my name is Soul
Store me inside you phone
We need some time alone
In our near future, future
Cause I am tryin' to bone
Whenever your man ain't home


Take off your pants, baby
And come to me
We done had all this drank
We done smoked all this weed
Take off your pants
Dont be scared of me
I won't hurt you girl
I'll be your therapy


When I come from out of that pussy
And I smell fresh air
You lost your voice yelling
""Pull my long ass hair!""
Had the 112 Clan
We could do it anywhere
I ask her where she want it next
She started staring at the stairs
So we did it on the stairs
And we took it upstairs
Then we came back down
When she came and she gave me
The crown that I wear, right now
Then I bounce like rubber
Just in case her man come unannounced
Send me a text message saying it was the bomb
I send her a text like ""hit me when he gone
So we can continue to creep.""
And now I'm in the sheets 3 days out the week
Freaks come out at night
But I'm up in the morning
And she up in the morning
So we gon' fuck in the morning
My only problem is running out of condoms
She say she on the patch, but I can't buy that




Knock on the door
He isn't home
Shes all alone
Her legs so long
Don't ask me whats wrong
Ask me whats right
Cuz I just wanna lay pipe for your info
She do tricks on the dick this is how I know
She make my whole shit disappear down her throat
And this a trip, she don't even choke
And I beat like a heart, she can feel a pulse
Beat, beat, beat, beat....

I love you too in all your forms
The slim and lovely virgin floating among German beer

Because my love, she gone with other boys

Will you be short with her, make her read those little Bibles?
Will you spank her with a mechanical corset?

Will you wash the easy bidet out of her head?

I'm not much nourished by modern love
Will you come into my life
With your sorrow and your black carriages
And your perfect memories?

The Twentieth Century belongs to you and me

Who discolour test tubes in the halls of science
Who turn up unwelcome at every World's Fair
Heavy with proverb and correction
Confusing the star-dazed tourists
With our incomparable sense of loss

Got a hole in my soul growin’ deeper and deeper
And I can’t take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is hauntin’ me
And the weight of the world’s gettin’ harder to hold up

Hold my breath and let it bury me

Won’t you drag the lake and bring me home again?


Who will fix me now? Dive in when I’m down?
Save me from myself, don’t let me drown

Save me from myself, don’t let me drown

Searching somewhere deep inside your mind
Hope you find just what you’re looking for
Heaven’s waiting with an open door


If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then
The road to ruin is a long road to hide in
We signed our lives away to have an escape
It’s something that will be whatever our fate


There’s no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can’t take no more lying
This is the last
There’s no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate


Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their side
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives


Is this the last together maybe this time now
We stand together and we’re holding the line here
There’s nothing we can do just sit here and wait
The die is cast that is deciding our fate

There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine

My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? 
Can't you see I am the big man? 
God level, I am the I am 
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic 
2016: burnt some discs 
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, ""issa knife""

Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick

Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

"Familiar ground's a distant thing
When you travel vague and crooked roads
And the sun's a scab on vacant skies
Now we always hope we're still alone

There's too much time for idle minds
Imagination's armed with hooks and knives
We count our fears to pass the time
Tired or not, don't close your eyes

A picket fence
A painted house
A quiet life
One where our days are calm
And night's are spent in kind
One where our hopes and dreams
Are attainable things
One where time can't reach

Gain half the plains now
Cut mountain chains down
Sleep when you can
You can't know how the night's fall

Things will be better there
Things will be good there
Don't stop to think
Just chase the dream we're chasing

I smell the fireplace
Warm light, a warm face
A quiet life
A life, a life, a life, a life
A life along the breeze

The dogs came at midnight
Guns drawn and eye's bright
I heard them laughin'
Black voices scratchin'
Black wind they move like
Our lives ain't worth the millions
As dog's tear the canvas
Flies on the carcass
But it buys the time we need

Taught me everything I know about Jesus

Takes time tryna get it right

Gave me more than I could ask

Tonight her voice will take me home

Save the last command, the virtue blinding
So far beyond the sun, still burning with the fire inside
Once alone again, silent stares for our last journey home

Paralyzed, intensified, mutation, frustration
Everlasting lifetime in the underworld
We'll travel endlessly, deluded disjointed
One man can't understand this sad misery

They've taken my soul
And now we stand alone insanity

In time we'll see the past unwind
Alive, still wandering our fallen land
One more time we stare into the blackened sky
For tonight, in our hearts now we feel
One last time see our destiny revealed


Shine glorious we ride, we stare into the blackened sky
Save the last command, the virtue blinding
So far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside
Once alone again, the silence stares

Shine glorious tonight, still blinded by the blackened sun
Save the last command, forever rising
So far beyond they come, still blinded with the fire inside

That He might hear

And would accept me

Coming down the hill

Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..


Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here


You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief


Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here


Where am I?
Flashback to that hospital bed
Wires lead to the holes in my chest
Can't rest, don't have control of my head
Strap me down, shut me up, pump that IV bag full of meds
Morphine in my veins, so what's this pain?
Am I alive or dead!?
I'm SICK of these fucking cold sweats!
Try to sleep, but get no rest
Ask for God to throw me a bone
He threw a noose and said, ""Go fetch!""
Grabbed that rope with both hands, wrapped it around my own neck
Jumped when I felt my neck snap: I woke up in my own bed!
I'm tired!  I'm living inside a hell!
My head is a fucking prison, my body's a fucking jail!
Sentenced without a trial, my soul has been set as bail
I'mma lose my fucking MIND if I don't get out of this cell!
One more minute, just one more night
One more round: get up and fight
Take those blows 'til the bells start ringing!
If I go out, I'mma GO OUT SWINGING!


Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go

I’m bringing with me the people I know
Deep down are funky
Oh yeah , we dap, we got the juice it’s on tap
Never take the time to rewind all the weak crap
Here, take it it’s yours the gift is calling
The sunshine be falling our way first every morning
I’m a magician you see I’m christened with condition
Held over from a future world I’ve come to you so listen
There’s a place out in deep space
Where all the brothers chant and dance and rant
And shave their heads like Buddha I’m a flyguy
You know I’m smoother
Of course no remorse is left for all those loser crews

I do not care what you do I always screw up
But when I do it’s nothing like you, I wish you grew up
You’re saying anything like promise to get clean
Won’t kick half dead you’re fucked up in the head
Just get him out of here, get him out of here
Get him out of here, yes, he’s making me sick
We push a sucker out, with much force and much clout
Didn’t want to do it, that’s not what we’re about
But we got to have a limit, how low can you get it
Seems about time to change the subject and sing about
The wise eyed girl that makes me feel good
And never do I leave misunderstood

I know you feel good too
You got a choice of what you’re gonna do

So nothing changed the more things stay the same
The more it doesn’t matter to a latter day St. Bernard
Acting hard but I throw down like a crazy retard
But what could make a man wanna walk around the schoolyard with his tool hard
And what could make the switch to call a girl a bitch
It probably happened when you first started rappin’
And when you know that you were stuck with Beavis
Now leave us on a note of positivity
I’m saying this for levity but if I leave it brief I call it brevity
I said I see the people rocking, which means there’s no stopping the flow
And you can just tell ‘em that you know

Come on, every night yeah we turnin’ up
And comin’ off live like a final 311 battle breaking idols
On the one you never heard before
You know the hard-core rockin’ pumpin’ the dance floor
Leave ya feet sore looking for your Micatin
You know the mic is deadly in the mood we into

Every time the enemy hear us they will be shakin’

You know, we were on the road for a long time together
I had the opportunity to dream with 2Pac
Before his dreams became a reality
He used to always talk about music, you know
And I'm just so happy, so thankful to be a part of this project
It touches my heart to be able to give something back

While your blood I'm taking

You spend me like a tree dirty dollar bills for leaves
Dark in a sea of my seeds and the tears on which you feed
You feed

Your body is a temple, a dormant altar to where
Infantile men lie around itching and nibbling
For a small piece of sanity of which you can not give

Shame!

Buying penance with my soul
And a little Heaven spent
Why the hell not take it?

Daddy what's a train? Is it something I can ride?
Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well, how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me ""Daddy what's a train?""


When I was just a boy and living by the track
Us kids would gather up the coal in big old gunnysacks
Then we heard the warning sound as the train pulled into view
The engineer would smile and wave as she went rolling through

She blew so loud and clear, we had to cover up our ears
And we counted cars just as high as we could go
I can almost hear the steam, those big old drivers scream
Sounds my little kids will never know


Daddy what's a train? Is it something I can ride?
Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well, how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me ""Daddy what's a train?""


I guess the times have changed, kids are different now
Cause some don't even seem to know that milk comes from a cow
My little boy can tell the names of all the baseball stars
I remember how I memorized the names on railroad cars

The Wabash and the TP, Lackawanna, the IC
The Nickel Plate and the good old Santa Fe
Just names out of the past, I guess they're fading fast
Every time I hear my little boy say


Daddy what's a train? Is it something I can ride?
Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well, how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me ""Daddy what's a train?""


We climbed into the car, drove down into town
Right up to the depot house, but no one was around
We searched the yard together for something I could show
But I knew there hadn't been a train for a dozen years or so

All the things I did when I was just a kid
How far away those memories appear
I guess it's plain to see they still mean a lot to me
Because my ambition was to be an engineer

Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn
But soon she found she was underground and wasted
I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage
Her body shook oh, she did her stuff
She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much
If you take the smooth you got to take the rough


Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid


I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd
I felt the sound shower around
And he would take you with him where no music's been before
As you merged the power surge together
His music knew no limits if you were in it's wake
You had no choice, no, but hear its voice
And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream
But once so strong survive or become weak




If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds
I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame
But fast car user lose
That legend's born from death and that is such a shame
Because every year new ones appear

Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
ASAP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant

All my ex-girls tryna fade me out

Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Tesla roadster, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get a nigga chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her

You've been stuck at the screen for a lifetime
You keep your mind sharp and clean
With a fix of caffeine for the night time

You got a page full of friends
And a world without end, DIKU ?
But if push comes to shove
You could do without them if they make you


With all this poison inside
It's much too late to decide
You've got your mind made up
You've been living a lie in your white room

For all the hours that you've cried
There's a year of love they denied
So you slip through the door and fall to the floor in your black room


You're a black room boy
You're feeling so way down
You're a black room boy
Forget the losses and burn down
You're a black room boy
Fall into city lights
You're a black room boy
Nothing else is easy

You kissed your mommy's hand
Wearing daddy's ring when they left you
And you buried yourself in the pain that they couldn't accept you

You're in a world of your own
Got no cellular phone they can't track you
But the girl at the store with the sketchy rapport She will back you

Nancy was alone
Looking ate the Late Late show
Through a semi-precious stone
In the House of Honesty
Her father was on trial
In the House of Mystery
There was no one at all
There was no one there at all

Seems so long ago
None of us were strong;
Oh, but Nancy wore green stockings
And she, she slept with everyone
She never said she'd wait for us
Even though she was alone
I think she fell in love for us
In nineteen sixty one
In nineteen sixty one

Oh, the morning would not come
Nancy was alone
A forty five beside her head
An open telephone
Yes, we told her she was beautiful
We all told her she was free
But none of us could meet her in
The House of Mystery
The House of Mystery

And now why don't you look around you
See her everywhere
Many of you use her body
Many comb her hair
And in the hollow of the night
When you are cold and numb
You hear her talking freely then
She's happy that you've come

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin’ home to a place he’d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin’ by a song
But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care
It keeps changin’ fast and it don’t last for long


But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky Mountain high 
Rocky Mountain high 


He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake


And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high 
Rocky Mountain high 


Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land


And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high

Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes


A cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes


They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes


Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes

When I am fast asleep
I dream and see you floating high above me
And I awake at dawn
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
From on the bedroom floor
I watch you sailing far above the seashore
In deep Atlantic skies
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
Above the avenue
I search among the clouds, trying to see you
But you are just a blur
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor


I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you
When I'm out on the bay
You're aloft in the airway


When I'm alone at night
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight
Suspended in the air
I wish your silhouette would always stay there
When I am on the beach
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach
But I can not take flight
Or float upon the air the way that you might
When I am in the sea
You gazed down from the sky, trying to see me
But I am just a blur
Through the waves, as I scuba dive below the harbor


The airway
You and I in the airway
Aloft in the airway
In love on the airway


I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you

Take a breath, hold it in
Start a fight, you won't win
Had enough? Let's begin
Never mind, I don't care


All in all, you're no good
You don't cry like you should
Let it go, if you could
When love dies in the end


So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lay underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me
Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life


Here we go, does it hurt?
Say goodbye to this world
I will not be undone
Come to life, it gets worse


All in all, you're no good
You don't cry like you should
I'll be gone when you fall
Your sad life says it all




Don't carry me under
You're the devil in disguise

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit, reminisce thinking a bliss of the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em
They tested it was stress that they under
We never really went through that
Cause we was born B.C. - you and me before crack
And nowadays things changed
Everyone's ashamed of the youth cause the truth look - strange
And for me it's reversed
We left them a world that's cursed and it - hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all condemned like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't it make em get teary
The world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There is no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white cause we're human
I hope we'll see the light before it's ruined

Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out of bags but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy, well guess who's giving birth to a baby
I don't trip to let her fade me
From outta the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
And even now I get discouraged
I wonder if they take it all back will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I say ghost take control drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from everyone
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother will be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress, never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brains when I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy?
Cause I choose to puff a blunt, and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace there's a war in the streets

Got young love running through our veins
And it keeps us numb like novacaine

And I see a long road that we gotta follow
Before tomorrow catches up


Oh, just take it easy
Hold on to this feeling
All our friends are leaving
And we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow



Can't stay here but you can't go home

And you look just fine on your own

You are the sweetest thing

And to think that you are mine alone

In all the world, it's true
No greater love

Stupid symphony strings
The same old tricks they used to get you to cry
Over nothing, over everything

This high was like a sorry parade
Of hearing traffic and going nowhere




Bison on the plains

I'm paranoid, I hate to sleep alone
My mind playin' tricks, tryna' to break my zone
Lost a lot trying to reach the throne
Many nights I ain't make it home
She want me there, it's like I need a clone
I try my best, no matter what, it's like I'm always wrong
I guess that's why I wrote this song
Just hopin' you would call my phone
Money hit my line, I'm on tour like all the time
Girl, you know I'm on my grind
I just need some peace of mind
I hope she hear this shit and press rewind 
We went our separate ways until next time
It's not a race, it's a marathon
At times, I feel a step beyond
I take it as a lesson learned and then we cross the finish line
Thank God I woke up in the morning
See the sunshine through the blinds
At times, I sit and reminisce on all the things I left behind


Rest in pieces, peace of mind
Someday we will reunite


This is the shit that your baby vibes to
Promise you that I'll make a baby with you
Make a mama of you, ain't no drama with you
My baby brings heat like a mama does too
I'll pay homage to you and college for the babies
I'll even move your mama to the Bahamas and maybe
I'll take you on the open road
And you'll take me where the ocean goes, ooh
I'm getting cheesy on these jungle drums
I sound like Weezy on a million 
The money's comin' and I know it but
The money doesn't have control of us
This is the shit, make your mama start crying
Not because she's sad, 'cause her baby's alright
That baby's her pride, that baby's her life
And mama would break down if that baby did die


Rest in pieces, peace of mind
Someday we will reunite again
Rest in peace my peace of mind
I hope that we will reunite


Break, break
Check, check, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no, n-n-n-n-nah-nah-nah-nah, now

And if you move, mama, what do we lose?
If we leave, mama, when do we breathe?
How do we eat, where do we sleep?

Come and listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge, says he
""Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll surely hang,"" says he
""And after that, Jim Jones
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones.""


And our ship was high upon the sea
Then pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin' round us
And the winds a-blowin' gale
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales


Now it's day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains
Well, into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bush rangers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the flogger down
Oh, I'll give the law
A little shock
Remember what I say
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay

I started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks

Now you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosions, Trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test, girl, I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusting seductions considered an art
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank ya for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer, my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop
Forget that grip, that ride it nonstop

Don't tell me how I feel

You're trapped in this town

Well, she don't know I already bought a ring
Hid it in the bottom left drawer, right beside the sink
A shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band
Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand


I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day

I'm gonna ask her to marry me

Pocket full of Ben Franklins

Surround the booth with yellow tape
Zip the kush then meditate
Your ladder straight, you featherweight
You heavyweight, it's Saturday
Gladiator, tell your neighbor
Gun on table, Buick LeSabre
Do you now, do you later
Dice game, pool table
Two flavors, too anxious
Got to kill these niggas

AP, Hublot, Patek, Rollie, gold teeth
Niggas stealin' so much sauce
Them niggas damn near stole me
They stole the swag and they stole my license
You don't know about my sacrifices
Today I worked out on my triceps
Bought a room just to shoot dice in
Whip same color Cicely Tyson
Smokin' gas one of my original vices
Made a mil' off my phone devices
Listen to your own advices
I'm laid up, but I'm prayed up
You a handful, you a A cup
Might rock a jersey and a Jacob
Y'all young niggas need to wake up

Tired of these rappers, tired of these jackers
Tired of these dances by these fucking backpackers

I'm sticking to these bitches, cause I'm sick of all these sisters
I'm sick and tired of tryna survive
I'm sick and tired of my environment
I'm sick and tired of feeling deprived
I'm one of a kind, when in my climate

Every nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attrakion
Shout my nigga Squadda, shout my nigga Mondre
If you disrespect them niggas, then I'm polishin' the nine-trey

I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Come and take a sip with me, take a sip with me


Once again, Mister Back Selling Crack
It's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map
Street raps, new face, sampled with no credits
Doubting myself cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise everyone does, so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem world to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
Cause last year it was shoe box and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hints
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's 20 years of memory
And that's assuming I'mma live that long
If I don't, don't cry cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form, I live that song
An artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino


I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket

Take a hit with me, take a hit with me

Come and take a sip with me, take a sip with me


Why fuss? I'd rather fuck
Treat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust
Seven deuce, waiting on the bus
Before the boys bend the corner, tryna make a bust
Tryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I two-step, move my feet and keep it pushing
Always bouncing back, got it keep the cushion
And that's something fat, like eating all the pudding
A$AP we got it slap, bruh good looking
Fuck That, A$AP where I come from
456, Ice City slums
Weed in my pocket, coke in his tongues
Buying swisher sweets, no more honey buns
Fresh white tee, bright like the sun
Only nigga round here rocking Мишка

Aw nigga don't trip, you gon' make me get on some shit
Run up on you quick, wet up your whip
Aw nigga don't trip, you gon' get your monkey-ass hit
Runnin your lip, tryin to fuck with my clique

I come through your hood, stunting in my yellow Lam'
Murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruising, bumping Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinking the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King Kong in the street now
I do a little house shopping, and buy me a crib
It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'd turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But Becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearing fake shines, I'm rocking a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm


Nigga you hustle, but me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need; them trees, that hard, that powder
My niggas move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna


Where I'm from you learn to blend in or get touched
I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggas know my steez, they don't fuck with me son
You got a appetite for hollow-tips, I feed you my gun
This is that Ferrari F-50 shit, it's real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybachs
I got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for ten bodies you get from one cuz
I live life in the fast lane; hundred miles an hour
Chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playing
I'm up early with the birds, word, putting that work in
Pirellis on the Porsche chirping, I'm making moves
I got a hundred mil from music, a hundred grand from crack

Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time


So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again

So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time


Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time


So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again

So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time


Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace 
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time


So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again

So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

Friday night's your poem
Saturday your wet dream
Sunday wakes you up slowly
To a face that you don't wanna see
I turned you on, but I left you hungry
And your heart didn't matter 'til the weekend is gone
Baby sure you're getting some
Really didn't matter if I can't


So if the love that you're chasing after
Is in the heart to be found in the out of reach
Well, if you break it all down
Take a good look around, you'd see
That it's closer than you might believe


Should I take a number?
Should I wait for a day to arrive?
I still hear you cry on my shoulder when
Its not nice on what I gave you tonight
But I let you in
But you leave me standing
And you wonder why I can't relate anymore
Don't you ever think of what it comes down to
No one has to figure out the way that I do
And you know I do


So if the love that you're chasing after
Is in the heart to be found in the out of reach
Well, if you break it all down
Take a good look around, you'd see
That it's closer than you might believe


Slow and easy
I'll tell you that's the way to go
It'll change the way you see me
And you'll will know it
And you will know


So if the love that you're chasing after
Is in the heart to be found in the out of reach
Well, if you break it all down
Take a good look around, you'd see
That it's closer than you might believe


Just turn around and get it

The verbs that just don’t flow

Partial stoning of the heart
Waiting for something to start

Makes me think it’s all gonna end
Confusing use of time

But every time I turn the volume down
All I hear is the deafening sound
Of your heart’s pound

But the trying again
Makes me think it’s all gonna end
Confusing use of time

Today, the longest day
Hearing repeating things you’d say
Confusing use of time
Can you hear the void I describe?
What could I say vacancy sounds like?

Puffing on that trash, you don’t blow no gas, like a Tesla

As a young buck, niggas always knew I puff
Yousta see me go to school, on a smoiler bus 
I'm a sped ed kid, I'm gettin' all this paper 
You should sit, scibble lines and see where it take ya
Had violent tendencies, so they thought I was dumb
While the so called smart kids was poppin' gum
I think about poppin' a gun, and then get the lump sum
Grampa my role model, yousta suck on a bottle
A pint a Crown Royal, make your insides boil
Been smell like Ben Gay, cause his back go out
He the one that taught me, what bein' black's about
Now peep the roach on the walls, that fall and crawl on my friend's
Wrist, Sittin' up in them Benz, to be in the pen
In the hood we hit the number, but never the lotto
Life in the fast lane, one wheel hit the pothole
Let's go, let's flow nigga

 - 2X
War, what is it good for absolutely nothin'
But niggas keep frontin'
Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier
Die like a soldier


War, state of mercy nigga
You see me pop off nigga
Ain't no peace talk, bitch ass nigga
Fake gangsta nigga, you want to seem nigga 
You don't seem nigga, yeah nigga

"Little Miss Cecilia Green
Little over sweet sixteen
But the cutest flapper that you've ever seen
When the fellows pass her by
She will always wink her eye
When she talks to them
When she walks with them
This is what they'll cry

Does your mother know you're out Cecilia?
Does she know that I'm about to steal you?
Oh my when I look in your eyes
Something tells me you and I should get together

How bout a little kiss Cecilia
Just a kiss you'll never miss Cecilia
Why do we two keep on wasting time?
Oh Cecilia
Say that you'll be mine

Many funny things occur
While the boys are courting her
I refer to one case in particular
She went with a boy named Joe
Who was always lisping so
When he'd ask this miss
For a little kiss it would sound just like this

Doeth your mother know you're out The-thiel-yuh
Doeth thee know that I'm about to thteal ""yuh""
Oh my when I look in your eyth
I feel very you know tho un-neth-the-tha-ry

"In my heart is where I long for you
In my smile I search for you
Each time you turn and run away I cry inside
My silly way, just too young to know any more
In my world the devil dances and dares
To leave my soul just anywhere
Until I find peace in this world
I'll sing a song everywhere I can
Just too young to know any more
The wind covers me cold
The starry skies all around my eyes
Far behind the city moans
Well worthy of the people there
Oh, the psalms they love to hear
So let me sing a song for you
Just to help your day along
Let me sing a song for you
One I've known so very long
Oh, please could you find the time

This could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
I turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away, here in my head


And I had sworn to go it alone and hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Go it alone and hold it along
And hold


Oh, lonely deeps and hollows
Are half a world, half a world away
My shoes are gone, my life is spent
I had too much to drink
I didn't think, I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed


To go it alone and hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
And hold


Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes, high-alive
Blind eye that turns to see
The storm it came up strong
It shook the trees and blew away our fear
I couldn't leave it here


To go it alone, hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Go it alone and hold it along
And hold
Go it alone and hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall

They are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me
When I thought that I just can't go on

And they brought me their comfort
And later they brought me this song
Oh, I hope you run into them
You, who've been traveling so long

Yes, you who must leave everything
That you cannot control
It begins with your family
But soon it comes around to your soul

Well, I've been where you're hanging
And I think, I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy
Your loneliness says, that you've sinned

Well, they lay down beside me
I made my confessions to them
They touched both my eyes
And I touched the dew on their hem

If your life is a leaf
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love
That is graceful and green as a stem

When I left they were sleeping
And I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon

And you won't make me jealous
If I find that they've sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that
And besides it would still be all right
We weren't lovers like that
And besides it would still be all right

Kick your shoes off in the corner
Mama, tuck them babies all up snug
Sis Draper's coming over
We all gonna cut a rug

When you see that lantern swinging yonder
Coming up the holler road
Them dogs'll get to barking
Ought to tie 'em all up with a rope

Now you boys better get in tune
Sis Draper's gonna be here soon
Don't shoot no dice or get too tight
If you're going to pick with Sis tonight

She come down from the Boston mountains
There was lightning in the air
Honey on them fiddle strings
Magnolia in her hair

She's a diamond in the rough
If you can't see the shine that's tough
Play all night for the likes of us
Sis Draper's got the touch

She'll play all night if she feels like it
Have some fruit punch if you spike it
Sis don't care who don't like it
See, Sis got a hell of a bow arm on her

She stepped up and sawed one off
And Uncle Cleve dropped his jaw
Said ""She's the best I ever saw
She must be from Arkansas""

I think Grandpa used to date her
Grandma says she still hates her
All the fellas stand up straighter
In the presence of Sis Draper


Sis Draper is the devil's daughter
Plays the fiddle Daddy bought her
Plays it like her mama taught her
She's a traveling Arkansawyer


She put her fiddle in a box
Said ""It's getting awful late""
She's on her way to Little Rock
And Little Rock can't wait

So we all stood out in the yard
Hands all full of watermelon
Watcher her leave, watched her go
Wishing I was in that wagon

Plays the fiddle Daddy bought her
Plays it like her mama taught her

An old friend sends you a Facebook request
You only find out they’re racist after you accept
There’s free office cake on the first day of your diet
It’s like they announce a new iPhone the day after you buy it
And isn’t it ironic, don’t you think?


It’s like swiping left on your future soulmate
It’s a Snapchat that you wish you had saved
It’s a funny tweet that nobody faves
And who would’ve thought it figures


It’s a traffic jam when you try to use Waze
A no-smoking sign when you brought your vape
It’s 10,000 male late-night hosts when all you want is just one woman, seriously!
It’s singing the duet of your dreams, and then Alanis Morissette shouting at you
And isn’t it ironic, don’t you think?
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think


It’s like you’re first class on a Southwest plane
Then you realize that every seat is the same
It’s like Amazon but your package never came
And who would’ve thought it figures


It’s like Netflix but you own DVDs
It’s a free ride but your Uber’s down the street
It’s singing “Ironic,” but there are no ironies
And who would’ve thought it figures


Life has a funny, funny way of sneaking up on you
... of helping you out

But doesn't that mean that the tour's gonna sell, though?
I try to explain the good faith that's been wasted
But after an hour, it sounds like complaining
Wait, don't go away, can I lie here forever?

'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time 
How it start, how it start?


Started off with runnin' from coppers
Duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin' the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF state Feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us, wasn't bitter or sweet
See, if a nigga don't hustle, then the nigga don't eat
On these streets, livin' do or die, circle complete
Repetitive motions of felons in a rush for G's
Please understand my history, a man of many hats
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, in the cracks, but blind
Even though we have hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain


Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Stranded in the County in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my 21 birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls… lost souls, nigga
For my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul

My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with a three-five
When he get out, would I be dead or alive?
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin' trap shut
My mom dukes got a little bit of thug in her
The devil loves sinners: crackheads and drug dealers
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin' over
Never stayin' sober, the brain over and over
Backtrack, my stack's fat, I used to take new
One love to my crew, ayo, this one's for you


R.I.P. … rest in peace to Mu grandmother
Know what we gotta do, baby, one-time

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time!
One-time! One-time! One-time!


I was born 22 years ago yesterday
But see, I saw no reason for me to celebrate
Let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein' consumed, already predictin' my doom
Soon to be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done, tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin' the time of day
Crime for pay, I'm on my way
But don't know where I'ma end up
I swear to God, it's just a set-up
And these are the words from the mind of a lost soul


Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life

There I was, laid out on a table
Screaming sweat and bare feet to the floor
In my life, I'd not soften
Things that cut, and burn so often
But I sit, think of something
Scared to face, the dying nothing


See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore


Where I go is when I feel I'm able
How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore
In my mind, not forgotten
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slipping
Buzzards cry, when flesh is ripping


See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore


Here I sit writing on the paper
Trying to think of words you can't ignore
In my eyes, what I'm lacking
Score at face, a ten for slacking
Sign the deal, set in motion
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean


See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore

Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through


Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurts to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried

I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' for the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
I left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you

When I reminisce, ignorance was bliss
Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was, 'cause the way it
Was just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun livin' life on the run
Never had chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle, so figure it out
Always thinkin' that you know every little thing there is to know
But you don't really know, you know?
It's like love, some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me it's just a pain in the ass
But I'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last


Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world


Who's the man? 
Who's the man? 
Who's the man?

Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
At least I can say that I've never been a quitter
I remember high school, man, I hated high school
It was like prison with bullies always puttin' me down
Just a little skater-boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive 'em, now I got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my Gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still I never want it all, and I never want it now
I just wanna cruise, if I lose, then I'll figure it out
How the times files, even with the blink of an eye
When you're young, you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's was amazing what you learn when you've never been taught, you know?


Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world


No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world 
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world

Smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers, in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same


The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake


Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high


To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings...
La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...

She can't do this anymore
She bought a ticket west and left me staring down the storm
Now I'm sittin' here all alone
In an empty house that used to be a happy home
She said she needed sunshine
She had enough of clouds
I knew it wouldn't take too long for her to figure out


It don't rain in California
You won't see a single storm cloud in the sky
It's always clear, so there won't be any tears
Leave you standin' in the downpour trying to hide
It don't rain in California like it's raining here tonight


I can't do this anymore
I hopped a plane and I found my way to the California shore
Now we're sittin' here all alone
You knew that I was comin', you sounded happy on the phone
I knew you needed sunshine
It seems I brought the clouds
The thunder and the lightning seem to follow me around


It don't rain in California
You won't see a single storm cloud in the sky
It's always clear, so there won't be any tears
That you're standin' in the downpour trying to hide
'Cause it don't rain in California like it's raining here tonight
It don't rain in California like it's raining here tonight

Sitting at the bar, telling fairy tales
Pouring whiskey in wishing wells, feeling sorry for myself
There's only one person in this world that can save me from myself
So I pick up the phone, pray that you're home, I'm all alone


Saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad


There's some jerk at the bar smoking a big fat Cuban cigar
And I wave my hands through the smoke
I think I see you, but it's some kind of twisted joke
Oh, you wouldn't be caught dead in here
Just the thought of me crying would make you disappear


Saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up

The night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain
I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

I had no time to spare
I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she caved my head
Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart
Broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball
Left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head and
Smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly
Kept me going around
So she don't know I crave her so-o-o

I'll give my love in vain
To reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain
I will go back again

"The snow on your eyelids that curtsy with age
Is freezing the stares on tyranny's wings
The bitter is hard and the warmth of your skin
Is diseased with familiar caresses
Withdrawing from splendor and royal decay
Among all the triumphs and jaded awards
The angry and blazing circus of sun
Blasphemes as the crown prince arises

You cannot beget all the sins that you owe
To the people of paradise magic
Pretend to answer passion and form
With foreign rationalizations
Primroses are the jewels that lurk
Among masks of pleasure that flicker with doubt
Embraces of fame that's simultaneously fear
To advance and demand to be recognized

The river shall flow through hollow green faces
Of caricature's resentment etched out of the tongues
Both reluctant princess asleep before birth
The classical sensitive failures
The worshipping wicked cling to the dark of your heart
Lying there and wait with your angels
Moan and ravish from dawn to dusk
The avaricious young lovers

Reflects in these cynical times
It seems like the future was calling
Something brought me to life

As I pick up the pieces
Yet I'm still unaware
That my nemesis
Is my own belief
And my actions will change why I'm here

'Cause I won't give it up
I have seen enough
And I will never stop
A Universe where stardust leads the way
Help, I died just to make you see
Stardust won't you take me
To galaxies where all hope's astray

I shake by the septic infection
A rush as it runs down my spine
It feels like I'm crossing the border
My hunger comes alive

As I pass through the mirror
It's a travel through time
There's no turning back
On a one way track
My addiction which renders me blind

'Cause I won't give it up
I have seen enough
And I will never stop
A Universe where stardust leads the way
Help, I died just to make you see
Stardust won't you take me
To galaxies where all hope's astray

An image of godless ideals
Is what reflects in these eyes
Seems like the heavens are falling
It's the truth of my demise

Stuck alone and scared

Wondering, we still ask the question why
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad

Messed up the suit that he'd bought from Marks
Because

Saying, ""Never trust a man with egg on his face""

Three months later, Mrs B. stands
A smile on her face, blood on her hands
The kiddies got scared and ran home to bed
The headlines in the papers said that

She was the victim of an awful plan
Announced through the mouthpiece of a little green man

Dear Mama, don't worry, I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak – all I heard was…


Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy



I see Bloods and Crips runnin' up the hill
Lookin' for a better wayyy
My brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
‘Cause even thug niggas prayyy
Hopin' God hear me, I entered the game
Look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent – casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this yo land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin' time fly, I love my people, do or die
But I wonder why we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, ""Nigga, get paid!""
No one can understand me – the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say… 


Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy
I feel crazy 


God, help me out here, ‘cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
‘Cause money's like a strong prescription
Drug, it's got me addicted
To the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin' about the paper
With the pictures of the president's head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money ‘cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So I gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life do 'em right or did life leave 'em dumb?
Who has the answers? I wonder, I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
 ‘Cause they don't even know
A million things run through my mind
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time



Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy


I feel fucked up in this bitch
I smoked half a ounce to the head
Chocolate Thai, indo, Hawaiian, lambsbread, buddha
All that shit!
I'm fucked up in this motherfucker
And Hennessy don't help
And Hennessy don't help
Thug Passion in this muh'fucker
Makaveli the Don puttin' it down to the fullest
Maximum overload
3 Day Theory, Killuminati to your body
With the impact of a 12 gauge shotty
Double-I slugs, no love, straight thugs


One time for my niggas in the jail cell

One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell

One time for my niggas in the jail cell 
One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell

One time for my niggas on the Death Row

For my niggas on Death Row
One time for my niggas livin' broke

One time for my niggas livin' broke

One time for my niggas in the jail cell

Wonder if it get me high, yeah

Took a trip to San Francisco
All  our friends said we would jive
Didn't  work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We  used to only worry for them after dark


I’m  still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No  bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It’s just a dream I had in mind


I  flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do now


I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly

Baby why you acting so surprised
Looking at me like I just read your mind
Well girl I know what you wanna hear
And what goes good with kisses and cold beer
You're smiling at me like you're ready to rock this
Well I got this


This ain't my first radio
No this ain't my first turn it up
Burn it up under the moon
Small town, ride around arm around you
Girl you know I know, which one will get you
Singing along with your hand out the window
Slow it down dance on the side of a dirt road
Uh-Oh where did the night go don't you know
This ain't my first radio

Yea I know when to keep it down low and when to turn it to ten
And when you're smiling like that you know I gotta play it again

This one right here is gonna get you closer
Head on my shoulder before it's even over
I got an all night sound track, you just kick back
Baby this ain't my first radio


No this ain't my first turn it up

Singing along with your hand out the window
Slow it down dance on the side of a dirt road
Uh-Oh where did the night go don't you know
This ain't my first night


With you out hear like this
Parked in the window stained sunrise kiss
Me being the DJ, you being all mine and
I damn sure hope it ain't the last time
No girl it won't be the last time
This ain't my first radio

""No thank you"" is what I should've said

But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come


One sip, bad for me

And ""no thank you""

Standing in ruins blinded by another meteor
I never even saw it coming down just like all the ones before
The irony of the conveniency of things made up in your head
Inflate, fixate while you suffocate every promise that you've ever made


The saddest tale
I’ll never tell
Will echo through
The halls of Hell


An eon lost
The countless cost
Need your next victim to malign
It was only just a matter of time


I've watched you do unto others
As you've imagined they’ve done to you
And your pride has come before the fall and your downfall is believing all
Your fantasies are true
I should have heard the warnings
I should have seen the signs
As you did unto them you'd do to me, your true nature would show eventually
It was just a matter of time, a matter of time


The ring of empty words, a string of dead intentions
Moments strewn across a timeline, you've deleted every one
I watched you over years make a career of making enemies
I was so dumb to think you wouldn't be the one to turn your weapon against me


The saddest tale
I'll never tell
Will echo through
The halls of Hell


An eon lost
The countless cost
Need your next victim to malign
It was only just a matter of time


I've watched you do unto others
As you've imagined they've done to you
And your pride has come before the fall and your downfall is believing all
Your fantasies are true
I should have heard the warnings
I should have seen the signs
As you did unto them you’d do to me, your true nature would show eventually
It was just a matter of time, a matter of time!





It was just a matter of time
An eon lost
The countless cost
Need your next victim to malign
It was only just a matter of time




This is my last goodbye, my epitaph for you
False pretense of integrity, you believed your lies were true
And this could be the saddest tale I’ll never tell
Evanescently will echo through the halls of Hell



I've watched you do unto others
As you’ve imagined they've done to you
And your pride has come before the fall and your downfall is believing all
Your fantasies are true
I should have heard the warnings
I should have seen the signs
As you did unto them you'd do to me, your true nature would show eventually
It was just a matter of time, a matter of time!

DJ E Dubb


A young boy from the hood South
I knew I didn't belong because I stood out
My house burned down, left with nothing but a doubt
I need me something new that I could learn now
Riding in the old school, listening to old music
Who granted, I really couldn't stand it
But damn it, I love it now
Put nothing above it now
Which is why I never thought about rapping 
I needed something more sweet
Which is how I found out about a thing called R&B
Unfortunately, nobody was supporting me
That's why I kept it on the low like a submarine
I remember the days being a rookie
The ones that been playing the game would overlook me
And once they saw that I was cold, producers started cooking me
And all the new rappers got old so I say


Thank you R&B
You separate me from all of these locals surrounding me
You brought out the cloud in me
Now, I can shine
I don't want to waste no time
I just want the fame right now
Be a celebrity, all of this fame, yeah God
I just want to make it mine
Hear me out, I deserve it
I just ain't been heard yet
Down low, it's worth it
I'm just so glad I can do something these people can't
And that's why I say thanks to R&B
Oh thank you R&B 


Singing in the shower but came
Singing into a studio mic for a couple of hours and then
I realized I was better than most
Cockiness to the side, I had a hell of a float, for real
I've always asked for a deal, fuck a bargain
Tryna get signed like a tree, bark carvin'
My songs hot, they should charge me with arson
And I kill the beats sick, call it coughin' in a coffin
Singing to your girl on the phone, late at night
Pleasure P did it wrong but I made it right
Success ain't cheap, I'm working hard to pay the price
Make way for Bryson 'cause I'm taking flight 
I appreciate the haters
And the ""Tiller would never be famous"" debaters
And I appreciate every single prayer
And thank God most for giving me the breath to say this


Thank you R&B
You separate me from all of these locals surrounding me
You brought out the cloud in me
Now, I can shine
I don't want to waste no time
I just want the fame right now
Be a celebrity, all of this fame, yeah God
I just want to make it mine
Hear me out, I deserve it
I just ain't been heard yet
Down low, it's worth it
I'm just so glad I can do something these people can't
And that's why I say thanks to R&B
Oh thank you R&B 


Man, I swear 
I love you, you know?
It's something special to me 
I need it 
I'ma do it 
And keep going 
And keep going 
And let's go HQ


Thank you R&B
You separate me from all of these locals surrounding me
You brought out the cloud in me
Now, I can shine

Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas



Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile 
And on every street corner you'll hear


Woah those silver bells

It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling , hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day


Strings of street lights
Even stoplights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures


Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big day
And above all this bustle you'll hear


Woah those silver bells

No view at all, but I've got my sights set way up high now
Steadily down from the top of the nearest mountain side and
Oh, we get lost in the world


Not gonna give it up
Give it up
Give up to learn to live in a place called tomorrow
Not gonna give it up

It's all a charade 'til the wind blows your name
And you stand up, stand up

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore


And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deep grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?


I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away



But the memory still remains
All the past years, not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around


In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hand
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun

Yo, to be honest, I feel completely alone
Like nobody knows me, nobody understands me
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, it's kinda like this, check it out


I'm a little bit numb, little bit frozen
A walking emotion, but nobody knows it
Nobody knows me
I'm lost and I'm caught in a cold dream
But they don't see that I'm walkin' around so boldly
'Cause nobody out there knows these
Thoughts in my mind, am I wastin' my time?
I know, I won't survive; hold me
'Cause I'm bleedin' to death
I got these holes in my chest
I feel like no one respects the fact that I'm up to my neck
I've done my best, but still, yet it seems like I'm out in the cold
Look at me froze; here on my own
Please, don't let me die here alone


I cannot face this alone
I can't get by on my own


Lost in the moment, life in a coma
Lyin' around, see my life getting colder
I'm alone, but I go nowhere
Living in a prison in my mind; so scared
I don't wanna be this way, nah
I don't wanna feel this way, nah
I don't wanna die this way, why am I this way?
Wish I had wings so I'd fly away
Nothin' around me, up where the clouds be
I'm the real definition of drowning
My pain and my head keeps pounding
How's he even living in the state he's at?
Left the pain, swear I'd never go back
But it's right here and it's quite clear that it's not leaving
Does anybody hear me?


I cannot face this alone 
I can't get by on my own 
I cannot face this alone 
I can't get by on my own 


I was a little bit numb, little bit frozen
Kinda hard to see when your eyes ain't open
How you gonna breathe when your sin keeps chokin'
You to the point that you feel hopeless?
Hopin' things will turn around
Kinda hard to fly when you layin' on the ground
Jesus is the only reason any of us breathin'
Yeah, so don't get down
You ain't gotta live your life in the cold
Thinkin' nobody out there knows
What you been through, where you been to
Yeah, you ain't gotta live alone
He's Messiah, He's Creator
There ain't no one out there greater
Forget about them haters, accept Christ and make a change-up
Yeah, 'cause you ain't gotta die this way
Let Him wipe them tears right from your face
Life's a dream
So you better get back on track; in other the words, I'm saying:
Give Him your pain, give Him your hurt
Faith is way more than just going to church
Making your money and going to work
You don't give it to God? You'll watch everything burn, yeah
And this ain't no game
Living without Him is just so insane
People, they livin' for money and fame
Things never change 'cause we living the same
I don't wanna be alone; hate the cold
I'm so broken, I'm so froze
But no longer
'Cause I got my Jesus, and he makes me stronger


Yeah, woo!
I can not face this alone 
I can't get by on my own 
I can not face this alone

Yea let me let me tell you bout my homeboy Corey
This the first verse of the very first story
Call it the first letter you can call it what eva
Long as you hear the truth and leave surer than eva
Corey's a new believer actin like he's in a gang
Runnin round sayin his church is the greatest thang
Won't check a sermon unless it's his bishop's name
It seems he forgot to keep Jesus the main thang
Cause bishop ain't raise up after three days
Uhh he ain't take a case up offerin you his grace
Uhh but corey stay divided all of the time
Not Christ but a man that he's standin behind


I got this little letter
I'm tryin to break it down
So you can hear the truth in the sound
Division, a whole lot of sin
I can't forget the problem of people livin within 


I got this little letter I'm tryin to break it down
But let me tell you corey backround
He started off crazy party's full of shawtys
Religious ceremonies where people was gettin naughty
But all that changed the truth of God reign
The Gospel spread within em like viruses in his veins
But mayne even though his heart rearranged
He found himself caught up in some of his old ways
He layin up with women and sinnin was gettin strange
Thought the more he sinned the more Jesus was pleased to saved
He thought cause he accepted his brother touching his mother
That he was spiritual cause he let 'em get with each other
And corey had beef with another in the face instead of workin through it
Then opened a court case a slap to the face in the God who gives grace
Now corey's outta place tryin to carry his own weight




Now corey got married but everywhere he turned he sees lust burn
And women waitin to serve em yea and corey's learned
That Satan wishes to turn em away from his wife to satisfy all his yearnins, Divorce ain't legitimate these folk are degenerate
What God put together let nobody put a spin in it
See that ain't the end of it, he sought his own benefit
He would do the things that his friends saw as forbidden
And Dog you ain't no sin in it
His homies they were ignorant
They were made weak cos his liberty was the hinderence
Unlike an apostle, no concern for the gospel
No denying his rights
Now homie wasn't that thoughtful

What does friend mean to you?
A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused?
All included but you, alone

Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen and change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue

Be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way


Flowers watched through wide eyes bloom
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon

To reinstate

Because we're all afraid of heights

Underneath the stars we came alive
And singing to the sky just felt right
I won't forget the good times
While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times

We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times

But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times

When we cried
Those were the days
We owned the nights
Locked away
Lost in time
I found the nerve

In my younger days nigga I was robbing stores
Still got it for the low
Judge give you the book, hang your ass without a rope
When you at the bottom seem like you ain’t got hope
And when you got kids nigga anything will go
Green dots at funerals, they got my head fucked up
Can’t digest these percocets, they got my chest fucked up

Violating laws, breaking all the rules
Smoking marijuana, riding with them tools
Hanging ‘round hustlers, robbers, and fools
Hand to hand with strangers, watching from an angle
Praying for an angel, protection from danger
Cause I done seen plenty niggas died that had a banger
And I done seen them niggas’ partner ride out of anger
And never came back, about them greenbacks
Now have you seen that? These are obscene facts
And just because we paid, the stress don’t decay
Still thinking ‘bout them losses, winning never made ‘em fade
With Gs being dead and  on my mental
It hurt so bad that I can’t do the shit I didn’t do
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit be killing me
I hope you niggas feelin’ me ‘cause I know that you hearing me
And just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok, no
Man just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok

Sometimes you just gotta break down


When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'


The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
Till they call the last call
And you're just drinking about the past
Like the bottom of the bottle
Knows how to get her back
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last


When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
Stuck on the left side


You're on the drunk part of drinking
The can't stop part of thinking
The wide awake part of sleeping, woah
You're on the broke part of breaking
The mistake part of making
You're on the cane part of shaking, woah


When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free

I want you
I want you to
I want you to march
Eyes goes right, shoulder arms
Left wheel turn, show your charms
Change your clothes, cut your hair
Ain't no joke, ain't no place for kids


When the flags are high, hear the battle cry
Treaty gone, see the bandit fly
Dig that trench, watch that blast
Shell-shock come, comin' fast
Name and rank, on parade
We might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what it means?
Do you know what it means?

I need you to
I need you to fire
Cock your gun, wet your sights
Get the bull, dead to rights
Volunteer, one pace back
On the beach
Ain't no place for kids


Well, the flack is high on the bomber run
You don't talk back to an ack-ack gun
Fire rage, and you're in a blitz
Keep your head, or you're blown to bits

Might get laid by a hand grenade

Propaganda time on the radio
Top brass shout as they clown around
And peace talks die in Geneva town
Do you know what it means? 
Do you know what it means? 
Do you know what it means? 
Do you know what it means?

Yeah, back off vacation
Time to send y'all birds on a permanent vacation though


Check my track record, respect is my black Lexus
Expect me to act reckless, I'm rich and I'm ass naked
A mink with half leopard, my drinks and my glass separate
I roll and I'm half breathless, just stroll through my last message
Like...niggas can't be serious
Never that leery shit, shit I'm mysterious
Move mystique on 'em, the doses increase on 'em
You ghost if you sleep on 'em
No joke when my peeps storming
Them cars they come in heavy
The God of the Serengeti
I charge with a large machete
And carve through your starving belly
Like...you shoulda known I was serious
Still the prettiest, point blank period


Feeding wild alligators on swamps, got miles and acres
No comp, whether it's freestyle, or written down on papers
So far, I've been down from maybe, a decade, I'm still the raw-rest
Plus, suede, and Ferragamo's, custom made jewelry's on us
Garments, fly apartments, they bugging say Nastradamus
Just wasn't one of my hardest, sold over a mil' regardless
Chill with them hard looks, I spark clips
If you Blood, or Muslim, 5 percent God, or Crip


Yeah, okay
Guns in the glove compartment
I'm dapper, but love the nonsense
The rapping, it numbs my conscience
I'm strapped when I come to concerts
Attack with a hundred monsters
They black and they running bonkers
We're back and we've come to conquer


The last of the fucking genre like...
Niggas can't be serious
Still the grittiest, point blank period
Flow tight as a midget's closet
As tight as a prison block is
No sight of po-lice, when we riot
Fighting the system fire
Get quiet, when I'm approaching
Get tires, jump out the roses
Sip Meyer's Rum out in open
I'm smoking that hydro, choking
I'm scoping, my eyes are on you
Don't reach 'cause I tried to warn you
No street corner Nas won't come to
To bomb you, .45's will harm you
Eccentric, I'm live but calm too
Cordial, but crazy cautious
Stroll through with some crazy gorgeous
Hoes, bodies like lady horses
Like...a whole stampede serious
Y'all niggas is funny like Eddie Murphy's Delirious
Sped up or real slow, never neo-soul
Hip-Hop only rocking with homie, we co-D's
Not Joss Stone, Hives, or Coldplay
If there was an old days, we pioneered it

Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too

Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns, at all worth in the fight fell too


Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby


And that day that we watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
And you gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs


Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching

Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy

Not an end, but the start of all things that are left to do

Take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off shake off
Chase off those stay-at-home blues

Oh my, my darlin'

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong


'Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh, eyes like wild flowers, oh, with your demons of change...



May you find happiness there 

May all your hopes all turn out right 


Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no 
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long 
Oh my, my darlin'

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong


'Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh, eyes like wild flowers, oh, with your demons of change

"Woe be to the girl who loves a songwriter
The days are pages in the book
He's the verses or the hook
Woe be to the girl who loves a songwriter
Woe be to the man who loves a songwriter
She's always searching for the song
In everything that you've done wrong
Woe be to the man who loves a songwriter
The melody is going to mic me

A key and a verse
The melody, we write history, babe

This heart and song goes, ""oh oh""
The melody, oh oh woah ho
Heart beats the time before the melody
Before the song is 
And what you never seem to know
Oh, heart is the time before the melody
Woe be to the girl who loves a songwriter
When he eyes a microphone
She ends up feeling so alone
Woe be to the girl who loves a songwriter

I've got these vices that keep me locked up inside a craze
Nothing suffices, I'm always hopin' for rainy days
This day and age, medicating's my way to meditate
Pre-meditate, then I kill the bitch on the second date
""Welcome to hell"" what I scream as I rise and levitate
If I had the chance to die, I would not hesitate
I'm with the robbers, grippin' choppers to kill a fucking copper
When I'm on suboxone, I'm toxic, don’t give a fuck who watching
I'm rotten inside a box, lil' woadie, you gon' recognize
Lucifer on my block, and Satan's gonna ride tonight
""$carecrow would you please, oh please, just give me a wish?
Cut my wrist and fuck my bitch, and then take me in the abyss""


Hot boy from the 7th Ward
Ready to burn it all!
Hot boy with them devil horns
Making them angels fall!
Hot boy pounding heaven's door
Breakin' down all the walls!
Hot boy here to settle scores, making my enemies crawl
Yung Plague, bitch, I got a thousand ways to make you pay
Fucked your bitch, I stole your whip and drove it in the fuckin' lake
You a simp, swing and miss, I'm a wave, slit your wrists
I'll tell the reaper, ""got another one for you to come and take, ayy""
Black in my eyes, got the black in my lungs
Grey in my mind, as the black fungus grows on the back of my tongue
Swallow a soul, now I'm back in the trunk with the blast from the pump
Back from the dead, but I'm black from the sun

"10:35 and I hope I've made the right decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
My heart is beating, I'm alive but I don't call this living, no, no, no, no, no-no
Rationalize 'til I'm blue in the face
You cannot lose if you throw the race
I'm still searching for the ants' invasion

10:36 and I hope I've made the right decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
Ninety-eight point four's the bore with twenty-twenty vision, no, no, no, no, no-no
You want a thrill so you come and see me
A cheap line in fantasy
I'm still searching for the ants' invasion

If I'd the courage I would make my way home
Too many antics in the forbidden zone

10:38 and I think I've made the wrong decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
Another lifeless man with a strange incision, no, no, no, no, no-no
I hope that insect doesn't see me
He's not renowned for his courtesy
I'm not searching for the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion

"Uhh
Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel
Yeah! Ma Ghetto Gospel!

Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin'


If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, nigga and bliss on the good days
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to 'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
We never really went threw that coz we was born B.C u n me b4 crack
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And y'all condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
My ghetto gospel


Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage Women growing up with aids
Cause that's the life when your
Living in the 
Or eating in the 
Or sleeping in the 
That's the life when your
Living in the 
Or eating in the 
Or sleeping in the 


Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I keep discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, I learn from everyone
And when its said and done
I bet this brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets
My ghetto gospel


Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage Women growing up with aids
Cause that's the life when your
Living in the 
Or eating in the 
Or sleeping in the 
That's the life when your
Living in the 
Or eating in the 
Or sleeping in the 


Gun shots every night in the 
Crooked cops on sight in the 
Every day is a fight in the 
 
Got kids to feed in the 
Selling coke and weed in the 
Every day somebody bleeding in the 
 

'cause that's the life when your
Livin in the 
Or livin by the 
Or eatin in the 
'cause that's the life your
Livin in the 
Or sleepin in the 
Livin in the
