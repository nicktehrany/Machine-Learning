"
Paradise waits on the crest of a wave, her angels in flames
She has no pain, like a child she is pure, she is not to blame
Poised for flight, wings spread bright, spring from night into the sun
Don't stop to run, she can fly like a lie, she can't be outdone
Tell me the cost, I can pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost
Sell everything, without love day to day insanity's king
I will pay day by day, anyway, lock, bolt and key
Crippled but free, I was blind all the time, I was learning to see
Help on the way, well, I know only this, I've got you today
Don't fly away cause I love what I love and I want it that way
I will stay one more day, like I say, honey, it's you
Making it too, without love in a dream, it will never come true
Honey, it's you
Making it too
Without love in the dream
It will never come true

Yeah, hey hey, hey hey


Passion queen, sold like black vaseline
She was a long tall Sally joystick
Know what I seen
She was all right


Drashing spurs
Pong man, puss and boots
She was a long-long live, long live who


Sweet pretty lady

Booze and a-fruities

All kinds of crazy

Hey lime juicy
De, de, de, de


New York chicks
Old jock wild in the city
Got a moon lady
Drive me crazy
Do what you do, do
She was all tight
I mean all right 


Sweet painted lady

Lose and a-fruities

All kinds of crazy

Hey lime juicy
De, de, de, sure
Only




Sweet pretty lady

Booze and a-fruities

All kinds of crazy

Hey lime juicy
De, de, de, de

Who is Ruby da Cherry? Let the internet keep guessing
That's always the fucking lesson
The less you grab, the more you getting

Back then, they didn't want me, now I'm hot, hoes all on me
Back then, straight from the swamp
We climbed up out, no moss on me
I'm clean as fuck, but keep it dirty, like I'm from the dirty
Ridin' dirty in a dirty ride, might stay alive until I'm thirty

"Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they’re here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I’m not half the man I used to be
There’s a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don’t know, she wouldn’t say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why’d she have to go?
I don’t know, she wouldn’t say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away

Hehe, nigga
I'm nasty
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
No, no, no


I was looking for affection, so I decided to go
Swing that dick in my direction, I'll be out of control
Let's take it to perfection, just you and me
Let's see if you can bring, bring, bring the nasty out of me
N-n-n-now sock it


Ooh ahh, sock it to me like you want to, ooh 
I can take it like a pro, you know 
Do it long bro with the back stroke 
My hormones jumping like a disco 
I be popping mess like some Crisco
All you gotta say is Missy go
And when you say go I won't move slow 


I'm at your house around midnight , don't fall asleep
It'll just be me, me, me on a late night creep
I'ma show you thangs that you can't believe
Jump in this b-e-d, and won't you sock it to me?
Oh no, s-sock it to me


Ooh ahh, sock it to me like you want to, ooh 
I can take it like a pro, you know
Do it long bro with a back stroke 
My hormones jumping like a disco 
I be popping mess like some Crisco

And when you say go I won't move slow 

Ooh ahh, sock it to me like you want to, ooh
I can take it like a pro, you know
Do it long bro with the back stroke
My hormones jumping like a disco

And when you say go I won't move slow 
Sock it to me

Ooh ahh, sock it to me like you want to, ooh

Do it long bro with the back stroke
My hormones jumping like a disco 
I be popping mess like some Crisco 
And all you gotta say is Missy go 
And when you say go I won't move slow


Uh
Why Missy be socking it to niggas like Ree-Ree?
The baddest industry bitches of the century
Hit hard like penitentiary dick
Finally admitted that we the shit combination is lethal
Popping Patron with Missy in the 600 with no see-through
Suffer the repercussion fucking with shit like this
We parlay puffing
Constantly making niggas suffer the consequence
Gotta get these ends bitch
House in the Chi with a Caddy, crib in Atlanta with a Benz
Niggas been huffing and puffing but ain't try shit
Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick
Besides, kid wanna bust?
Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me
Jealous because I live more plush
Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush
Bring the ruckus, plus...
I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits
For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it
Socking it to niggas and rocking it
Dropping 'em on the spot
Heat up any block or record shop
Knocking you off of your socks
Guaranteed platinum, watch two of the coldest bitches get hot
I be the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
We some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?
I'm the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
And we some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?


I'm your nigga for life, baby 
Let's continue to drive all this motherfuckers crazy
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, Timbaland, I see you, baby
I feel you, sock it to 'em, goddammit
It's 9-7, this the motherfuckin' bitch era

Dash light dripping on your sun tan skin
Radio playing that song again
Just pull me in, pull me in
Cut off shorts and a vinyl seat
Slide on over here next to me
Let me pull you in, let me pull you in girl
Ooh, if you didn't know by now I'm crazy about you
And I know the perfect place to stop


The smell of honey suckle on a river bank
Fireflies, sweet tea, and the summer rain
Pouring all the way, all the way down
Cherry red lips calling out my name
Two-tone Ford and that parking brake
Pushed all the way, all the way down
All the way down


Middle of the middle in nowhere now
Go ahead girl, let your hair down
Just close your eyes, it's going to be a damn good night
Cut off the engine, toss the keys
Ain't nobody here, but you and me
And a little moon light
Out here in the country side
Ooh, I gotta feeling that you're crazy about me, too
Girl and don't you ever stop

Who can tell the gauge of its veil?

Eternity's past was repeated in time
The eternal knot will be unbroken

Where does the moment go when it steals away?
Who will pen the pages of time?
Who will be the audience when the curtain rises?

Yet the glowing wick will not be quenched

Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men


In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away

Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through

Maybe this time I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell

To shadows of the past
Take a breath and I scream attack

A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb

As the boy became a man
In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand
So lost in ego, didn't notice when the time had slipped away

Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We're simply sociopaths with no communication, baby

Hope my wheels don't abandon me now
Seein' that I'm out here alone
I'm runnin' out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice
Guiding me to her arms
Mother, I'm alright
It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind
Before a blow to the head
By the gavel of time to wake up
Won't you wake up?
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
Was now the only solution for them keeping the score?
Just wake up
Can't you wake up?

So now it's time to execute, aim for the chest it's you
Nothing's cool, when you die, knowin' you kept it true
But if you didn't, broken wings
Let it be written, we ain't kiddin' to quit and
My missions smellin' my menace
Sittin' back, stacked off, spittin' and sippin' yak
These fakers play us, gettin' papers so blackjack
Perhaps, it's what we all, wanna do
Dreamin' and schemin' on livin', Untouchable


Well it's the O.U.T.L.A.W's, and we untouchable
Bringin' the ruckus to all you fuckin' bustin' bubble crews
'Cause nowadays spots we blaze
With dirty nines and Glocks on Yak's waistline always
The crime on these streets of this world is like a maze
Searchin' for more stunts, and blunts to blaze
Hustlin' to get paid, many different ways
Bodies drop on the other side, and the guns smokes haze
Fuckin' wit' outlawz, it's crazy, these pause don't break me
They cut like scissors, who is it, it's Yaki Kadafi
The grand wizard trump tight
To exquisite, to fuck with cowards
Best to duck quick, and run for safety
If you're shaky, heard about me lately
But ain't no jail to straight me
We untouchable

Sunrise showing every flaw
Paying for the nights before
Dark eyes, scanning every vein
Exploding cannot stand the strain
Standing on trial, scrutinize me
Questionize my strong denial


Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain


Windows, illuminating stains
Breakdown closing in again
Free fall as I close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Changing my course blurred and scorched
Breathing exhausts we distort
By gravity of such G-force




Breakdown close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Stained glass bursting in
Shattering my world again
Free fall never can
Ever reach the ground again
Dark eyes scanning in
Feel my mind explode within
Wanting much more implore you
Near to death's door to ignore
The screams of all
Who fall before

Your life's flashing before your eyes
And soon enough you will realize that this is goodbye
But what if I gave you a chance?
You just have to sell your soul


Look around, what do you see?
The choices you never had the guts to make
I'm sorry you never could be, the man that you wanted
But regret is wasted on me!


I can feel air inside my lungs again
All because of you
I can rebuild my life and start again
All because of you


This feeling's amazing, I know
But be careful, you know not what you wish for
Granted life again but now you've cheated death
There's nowhere to run when you run from yourself!
But fear not for as long as you live you are mine
And even in death you will find
You've lived with regret for so long but now is your chance to change what has been wrong!


I can feel air inside my lungs again
All because of you
I can rebuild my life and start again
All because of you


And I know that my destiny wasn't written in the stars
It was just a part of satellites and it's all because of you
And it's all because of you!
Don't ever trust the devil, bitch!
I never wanted this

I should have know my time was up


I can't feel air inside my lungs, I'm dead...
All because of, you!
All because of you...

Looking for familiar faces in an empty window pane

Listening for the secret, searching for the sound
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds

Willow sky, I walk and wonder why
They say love your brother, but you will get it if you try

Roll you down the line, boy, drop you for a loss
Ride you down on a cold railroad and nail you to a cross



November and more, as I wait for the score
They tell me forgiveness is the key to every door

A slow winter day, a night like forever
Sink like a stone, float like a feather








Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the sawhet owl
Oh, out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the wind howl

Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of the sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me

Just through the phones...

Woke up, seen Daddy in bed with another woman
Thought that was Mama, ""hey ma""- hold up, that couldn't
Be her, what I'm thinking, cause she just went to work
It was a naked look-a-like and Daddy there with no skirt
See, Daddy was getting busy when I barged in
Then when I said ""mommy?"", he chuckled and grinned
Then I soon realized that the  crust in my eyes
Had the chick looking like Mama love from the side
See, Daddy was a player and I wasn't surprised
He would holla at the girls when we rolled with the guys
Should I hate or embrace these ties?
I mean, I praise this dude, god's sake, he's fly
He couldn't do no wrong in my eyes

Wasn't tryna fit in my uncle's Timberlands, he was dumb
His shoe was too small to fit my big toe in
Ain't wanna walk in his shoes, he was just hoeing
He stayed broke, them bitches provided for him
Whether skinny, fat, black or tyrannosaurus
He was a gigolo, and never minded whoring
Guess the money gave him new ways to ignore it
Pussy is pussy, and new clothes the way he saw it
This ain't Enyce nigga, what she brought in?
To see him kiss her ass made me nauseous
Then he'd give her sloppy hugs like my baby gorgeous
He was just doing that for the new forces
All this fucking bullshit that had my brain distorted

Took a lil' black baby 'way from mom and dad

The mind of a slave, at a young age
Can't talk to a girl or know how to engage
He think being a gentleman is wrong and gay
But he feel that way cause that's how he was raised
He watched dad diss mom, she got play
And your uncle only had a girl when he got paid
All this shit put my life in a maze
Then when I grow up, marriage in a haze

It got a hole in the ceiling
Partner in the hole for a metro, I think it's silly
Shawty sucked mine so damn long, I got a hickey
She know she prettier than Ricky
She step in blood when she walk
You know them rich niggas in prison
Try to FaceTime ya and talk
This is the greatest of all
Don't want no haters involved
Hold up, I'm taking this call



My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch

Them kill Lumumba for his own-a-rights
But them can't kill the Rasta Man at all, 'tall, 'tall
Them can't kill the Rasta Man at all


That's the strangest man I've seen

Having the mark of a Nazarene

He carries a prophetical message

Borning out of time and out of age



The Rasta come from Zion
Rasta Man a Lion

The Rasta come from Zion
Rasta Man a Lion



Remember Jeremiah children

Or even Isiah

Moses in the pit of mud

Trodding from Buzrak with his garments dipped in blood



Oh what a dread, dread whola one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a strange, what a dread, but a righteous man
The Rasta Man, him come from Zion
What a dread, dread up-full one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a dread-black, dread-lock one
The Rasta Man come from Zion


Lightening!
Seven years years of famine for seven years of plenty
Is like two grains of wheat for one bale of barley
A hand-full of corn shall be on the hillside
And with that you've got to be satisfied


It was Elijah who prayed that it did not rain

He prayed and the rains came again

It was Joshua who commanded the sun stand still

He did that according to his Master's will



What a dread, dread whola one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a strange, what a dread, but a up-full one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a black, dread up-full one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a strange, dread-lock one
The Rasta Man come from Zion


What a dread, what a dread, what a whola one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a dread, dread lightening one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a strange dread, dread earthquake one

You're crazy man!

You know what? When you said that last time
I was kinda trippin' right, but now
You're right, I am crazy
But you know what else? I don't give a fuck


Check it out
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
Rather be buried than be worried, livin' held down
My game plan to be trained heavy, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin' in the cemetery
Cryin', I've been lost since my adolescence, callin' to Jesus
Ballin' as a youngster, wonderin' if he sees us
Young black males, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin' in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin'?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitchin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my beat bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight


Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight now
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight

You gotta snatch some collars and let them motherfuckers know you there to take them out

The love's been lost, the gloves is off, so figure
What side you tryin' be on, the barrel or the trigger?
A gang of niggas talkin' the talk, but ain't walkin' the straight line
They tryin' to hide behind the one time
Fuck being scary and constantly with security
I ain't afraid of whatever you faggots try to do to me
Shoot at me, try to corner me, orderlies try to get at me
Flip it like fake identities, stickin' it to my enemies 
And have you runnin' for your motherfuckin' lives
Till they put me in a courtroom fightin' for mines
The only reason I got foes that used to be friends
When niggas mumble under they breath, I'm under their skin, so then
I pray for the strength to handle what my city bring
Better stand for something, or your bound to fall for anything
The pitfalls, the potholes, I spit flows that generate straight crack sales, we got those
One hitter quitter split a nigga like a embryo
Bring it to your crib, to your kids, to your video shoot
Give me the loot, my dues all paid up
The half-assed gettin' rat packed and sprayed up
You say what? Speak up punk, I can't hear you
You're transparent, Reynold's wrap, I'm seein' clear through
Pray for my downfall, talk like hoes

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made


But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh

""What's a little bit of hunger?""

Yeah, what happens when it's too good to throw away?
You either let it go bad or go away



Take my time , take my time, I'ma take my time

I'm single again 
Told her we'll be better off friends 
Baby, I should just focus on me 
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again 
Told 'em that we better off friends 
Blaming you is just so easy 
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again 
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be 
Maybe I should spend this time on me 
Maybe I should spend this cash on me 


Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave 
Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need 
Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
Got me feeling like, ""I don't fuck with you""
Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
You fucking with the new me 
Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me 
All the trust gone, seems like all you say is, ""Prove it to me"" 
And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me 
Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad 
Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em back 
Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
Who knows? 


I'm single again 
Told her we'll be better off friends 
Maybe I should just focus on me 
And slow down, don't rush romance

Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time


What have you done for yourself?
What have you done for your mental health? 
I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
Short term fix, that breaks everything else 
And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled 
He said the major key is to be strong on your own
Lose your other half, you're never off balance 
Lookin' for the love in somebody else
That I probably should've gave to myself
Cycles I need to break in myself
If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so 


I'm single again 
Told her we'll be better off friends 
Maybe I should just focus on me 
And slow down, don't rush romance

Ein Sturm kommt auf
Und es wird Nacht

Wo willst du hin?
So ganz allein
Treibst du davon

Wer hält deine Hand
Wenn es dich
Nach unten zieht?

Wo willst du hin?
So uferlos die kalte See
Komm in mein Boot
Der Herbstwind hält die Segel straff

Jetzt stehst du da an der Laterne
Mit Tränen im Gesicht
Das Tageslicht fällt auf die Seite
Der Herbstwind fegt die Straße leer

Jetzt stehst du da an der Laterne
Mit Tränen im Gesicht

Komm in mein Boot

So gnadenlos ist nur die Nacht
Am Ende bleibe ich doch alleine

Damn she hurts the morning after
Drunk on thinking I could have her
Strung her out long like lights on a balcony
Come Wednesday, she don't care
Tuesday night I had her here
Like beads and feathers, it was heaven her hanging on me


She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras


Trashed my heart just like these streets
Her perfume's all over me
Just reminded me of a night I can't forget
She paraded me around
Swirled eyes, not I had a crown on my head till she left
Thought she'd stay, but instead


She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras

She ain't looking for love
No she's just looking for a real good time
And you can't change her weather
She's a hurricane every time

Is she ready to know my frustration?
What she slipping inside, slow castration
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me
Did she come here to try, try to take me


Did she call my name?
I think it's going to rain
Oh, when I die


Was it something I said, held against me?
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing
I can help her but won't, now she hates me


Did she call my name?
I think it's going to rain
Oh, when I die


She won't let me hide
She don't want me to cry


Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me
Could she love me again, or will she hate me
Probably not, I know why, can't explain me

Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam

Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning

Sometimes it makes me question
Sometimes it makes me saddened
Always it makes me angry
But when you can see it happening
Madness that's all around you
Nobody seems to worry
The world seems so powerless to act


It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day a new toll


Another assassination
The same day a new creation
But what are they coming into?
Security of a world that brings
One day another killing
Somewhere there's someone starving
Another a savage raping
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us

Each day it goes on


Blood on the world's hands

Tomorrow another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a ceasefire
They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day it could be happening to us

Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, roam and reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too 
Don't fuckin' take me for some kind of fool

Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views

I told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliché to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretchin' the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or they depressed, eatin' yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, wait and make 'em pay double
I'm anxious, when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was runnin' L.A., now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward, dog, I'm tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis, ask 'em

All we do is do it, all we do is do it 

All we do is do it
And all we do is it, all we do is do it

Suckin' on titties since I was eight

So don't be talkin' to me, pussy
Runnin' your gums like you be Loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than infant fabric, I won't have it

Freelance for God but do the work of Satan

Cut straight to them credits and hit you with a Uzi
Peel off in a dullies, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, poke on some coochie

But I bust heads for real, go 'head—

How you gon' dance with the devil with two left feet?

Talkin' out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street

Unless you David, remember, my nigga, I'm not Goliath

Are we desperate creatures crawling in the dirt?
Or are we lonely preachers hiding our beating hearts?
We sow the wind and reap the storm

Am I just a victim drifting in the raging sea?

Then is this all in vain?

Do I, do I, yeah, ooh

Put me on the jury

It's only temporary
Whenever we fight, it's only temporary
It's passive-agressive
When you say that you don't need me


But you know what we got together is real special
Now why you wanna go and lose that, boy?

Reject, are you no one?
Fear you're nothing
You know, I'll bet you think
You have a good reason to be living
In the limelight of the fortunate ones

You're too weakened by the poison
That they feed you in the living lie
They don't believe you, call to no one
Trust in nothing, little impotent one

Can you hear me
Or are you deaf and dumb to my language?
Do the real words seem to hurt you?
Well, put em' up, motherfucker

'Cause you'll feel it
When I stamp it on your forehead
So you will never forget that you're a reject
And you're no one and you're nothing

Go with it now and let it overcome you

Your mind is racing


I don't understand why you don't like me
Why don't you like me?
Am I so different from you?
Now does it scare you that I'm able to discern
What to love and what to burn?
I'll add your fuel to the fire, now

Stand back, brother, take your hand back
Leave it and I might crack
More than a smile or two you see
You don't judge what you don't understand
You can't deny what has been given to me

Went from chicken shit ho to magnificent pro
Shoppin' bags at the grove, MCM on the coat
Had to clean up her nose, had to dream up some goals
Swimming in Fendi business that's probably owned
I was walking down 6th, she pulled up in a 6
She said ""Hop in this whip,"" I said ""Bitch, you the feds""
She said ""Baby, don't trip,"" then she rolled me a spliff
Showed me pics of her kids, then she slid me some bread like


It's yours, babe, cause I got big money
So if you need something, don't be ashamed
It's yours, babe, cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin', I said okay
I said okay 
I said okay 
I said okay 
I said okay 


And now
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey

I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach 


It's too good to be true, I ain't got nothin' to do
I got keys to the coupe, I just spent all this loot
She said ""Get what you want,"" she said ""Live how you do
But If I catch you with other bitches, your throat - I'mma slit""
I said ""It's yours, babe, I put your name on this dick""
But I was lyin' of course, I'm slammin' chick after chick
Soon as she gave me the Porsche, I bang her right on the strip
I copped some white on the 5th and pulled up right on a bitch like


It's yours, babe, cause I got big money
So if you need something, don't be ashamed
It's yours, babe, cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin', I said okay
I said okay 
I said okay

I got gold, I got ice, I got Polo and Nikes
I got lean, I got Sprite, 'bout to spend a couple racks in one night
And mothafuckas wanna tell me take it light
Mothafuckas wanna tell me take it easy
I don't need no one's advice, niggas all wanna be me
I was riding down 6th and got stop by the pigs
They said ""Hop out the whip,"" I said ""Fuck did I do?""
They said ""Pop up the trunk,"" I'm like pop up this dick
They said ""Don't make us shoot,"" they said ""Don't make a move""
I was high as a kite, I had Xannies and white
I looked up at the light, like what the fuck is my life
They said my plates ain't legit, so they opened my shit
And when they opened my shit, it was snow in a fridge
I felt dumb as a brick, I had no idea
She had stolen the whip and this bitch had warrants and shit and
This bitch pulled multiple licks and this bitch had bodies on burners
And when I called her from my cell, the only message I heard was



I mean you gotta do what you gotta do
Don't scr... don't say a fucking word

No, you don't say shit
Now I'm gone, I'm on a plane, babe

But no, you wanted to spend the money
You wanted to live, you know, wanted to live large
You got new sneakers and all that
So now you deal with them bricks

Na-na-na-nah, nah, I can't do nothing for you
I told you I'm on a G5, I'm gone

Wearing your black dress, red shoes
Makeup, perfume, and diamonds
You always impress, turn heads
The second you walk through the door
You're like a real life work of fine art
Baby, you're priceless
And I just wanna get on, get that black dress down on the floor

There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's all I wanna do

Then you got that look in your eye
""There is something you've got to know""
And you said it as you started to cry
""I've been down the wrong road tonight
And I swear I'll never go there again""
I've seen this face once before
And I don't think I can do this again

There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say

I saw another look in your eye
And even though it hurt like it did
I couldn't let this be your goodbye
You say that you're sorry

Is there something here to believe
Or is it just another part of the game?

And the way they use to gaze into mine
The moon up above brings back memories of love

Never again but these words I can say
I'll try not to love and stay out of your way

I met a girl, snowball in hell
She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell
I got her to come on and move in with me
And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity


Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby stay


Her mama called me a thief
And her dad called himself commander-in-chief
I fought him off with my love
But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above



She had a dream, woke up in shock
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
I split the scene, the globe'd been spun
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me
With a message from the sun

'Cause that girl walked by with a rhythm
She had a walk with a runway swag 
High-heel shoes and a Bourbon bag 
She had a limo outside for her
Takin' her time and draggin' her fur
She was high-maintenance, you could tell
A thousand-dollar-an-ounce perfume you smell

Some people don't say what they're meaning
Maybe you should know, time for me to go
So, for now I gotta say 'El Passo'""

And that's her hook
She might appear soft but inside she was rough
A four-digit IQ, seven-digit bank account
She was good with money 'cause she'd never be without
You might think you're fly 
But it takes a certain guy 
That will sit your booty 
Make my mark all over your 

Don't stop, keep it real
If you're gonna roll around
Straight ignore that sex appeal

One says ""Dad, so how'd you do it?""

Chi c'e in un amplesso o il profumo di un fior

E giunta l'ora della fine ormai
Di quel famoso lunedi
Quando incomincio
Questa storia qui
Che non potremo piu raccontar

Gli uomini amavano le tenebre
Piu della luce che e nel sol
E le loro opere
Di malvagita
Hanno oscurato l'umanita

L'uomo, nasce
L'uomo nasce libero ma come uno schiavo
Vive
Vive nella sua malvagita

Quando nascevano
Gli uomini erano liberi ma
Li imprigionava la societa
Volevan essere
I padroni degl'altri e poi
Erano schiavi ancor di piu

Schiavi piu dei loro schiavi
Eran degli schiavi
Piu dei loro schiavi
Eran degli schiavi
Piu dei loro schiavi
Eran degli schiavi
Piu dei loro schiavi

""Lui"" quel giorno li
Mentre moriva sulla croce
Voi del popolo eravate li a guardarlo
E volevate assicurarvi
Che il suo sangue versato per voi fosse la fine sua
Quel giorno li
Con le sue spine volevate
Cancellar dai vostri cuori il volto suo
Perche per voi
Che nelle tenebre vivete
Era come un tormento la sua verita
E da quel di
Voi non avete ancora smesso
Di ucciderlo e la vita ch'e in ""lui""
E che da lui
Viene la dolce sensazione
Chi c'e in un amplesso o il profumo di un fior

Schiavi piu dei loro schiavi
Eran degli schiavi
Piu dei loro schiavi
Eran degli schiavi
Piu dei loro schiavi
Eran degli schiavi
Piu dei loro schiavi

Sucking nuts and giving hickies

Only dicking then I'm dipping
Call your man to come and finish
Woozy Medz and Oddy Nuff
Got my team, you down to fuck?
Film it, make a couple bucks
Fuck me while I sip this mud
Won't say your name up on the tape
Demonstrate, then penetrate filthy ass bitches
Always got to keep that trojan, magnum holding
Bend it over, hoe, and bust that pussy open
No exposing, just deep throating
Sipping on that purple potion
Grab that lotion, grab that camera

Girl, I thought you were the one
But a tundra status motherfucker like me can't be spending up my funds
For a little bit of fun with a dumb honey
Bitch, get off my money
Ain't got no diamonds, but I'm shining like I'm outside
And it's sunny
Now I'm chilling with a bitch on Pluto
Yeah right, motherfucker, like you know
Driving drunk by the lakefront
In my trunk is a bunk-bed, we can go hump
Yeah, girl, we can try judo
Who knows?
Maybe I'll buy you a chain
I know that's why you came to the show
No way it was to blow me on stage
Bitch, get off me, get out of my way
I'mma find me a new hoe
Kudos
Turn up, fuck that, I'm too low
Bitch, come hop in the two door
Getting head from a female Sumo wrestler resting her ass on my dick
Kick 'em to the curb, swerving back to the crib
No one's home, so I jack off thinking about your mom, you motherfucking bitch

Wild beast
Matisse mode
Squeeze on them butt cheeks
Slow down on that coke dosage
Hen-Dawg on that nightstand
Hit the coochie
Make it pop
Spread gams, then slam dance
Bobblehead she swallow cock
Until I pop and lock and bust a nut
Eat her up—I'm 69ing
Poke that bitch until I'm Joker smiling
She laser-beaming that bag-a-blow
With a big straw for that powder snow
Obsessed like Stinkmeaner
Rough sex with that sweet diva
Hit the cutty with the meat cleaver
Chop the coochie then eat the beaver
Beat that shit like Liam Neeson
Don't cuff a bitch—I ain't a precinct
On her knees, she yoga queen
Tiger clutch, she hold the D
Puffing nigga and swigging up
Then throwing up in this bitch
Giamatti, I strut the party
I'm Sideways in this shit

Put your hands on ya, hands on ya

Outlawz in this muthafucka

There go my enemies, my heart beat, pump with ease
So I bust instead of waiting for you punks to squeeze
Give you all of my 3 pound rounds, so you can fall
Bit the fact that Outlawz just kicked down your door
Bitch niggas be fouling out, hacking me with them wack rhymes
Grabbing ya .9, shooting scared, tryin' to take mine
I'm putting pressure on you niggas when I mobb
Deep bringing the heat to your dirty ass squad
You can ride, point blank range, peep game
From the , contaminated criminal Hussein
Bitch nigga I'm caught at project steps with the Tec
Murder next, and rob any nigga any set
Hussein, the type of muthafucka dying with trey pounds
Ghetto types we drown, hollow points from the waist down

Now, as I approach the scene, from smoking green, got my eyes closed
Niggas I call 'em my foes, I make 'em die froze
Watch me make 'em bleed, makin' G's, Lord help me with it
Got me painting pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
See me and pray for options, but the pressure's non stop
Niggas get to pistol poppin', then watch the body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit yo set, flash on
Blast on them bitch made niggas with my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seeing demons hittin' weed, got me hearing screams
Scared to go to sleep, I watch the scene like a dope fiend
Probably be punished for it, although you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas past the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for, I got the secrets of war

Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us

Down with no rounds left up in the pound when it sounds
Squeeze the lead off!, I blow his motherfuckin' head off!
Signal all the other Outlawz, as soon as shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain’t a cop here to stop me
These streets is black Hockey, your MOB? weak and sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass pre-style grammar
Locked in the slammer while I’m layed cocked cocked back like a hammer
Y'all newly wed’s throwing honeymoons, well times about up
Dummys I Leave no trace found with you face down stuck
Your biggest cannons couldn’t come close to touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt puttin' in work on your block tipsy

Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus

Check the murder rate percentage, niggas is finished
Getting blood checks from clinics, this thug shit is in us
Flowing through my system, you a victim, blunts.. I twist them
Fuck the whole world it’s us against them
You got the heat? Pull it out, and cock the hammer if you with it
Don’t make no difference here, with a 25-to-Life sentence
We already doing life on the street, like Al G
Niggas be heated when they walking the beat
This shit is Flakey, making fags shaky, Niggas hate me
Scared to face me, knowing that the Outlawz raised me!
Put me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I flex my money muscle, all the cheese got doubled

This is the Witching Hour


I can see the way you look at me
You can’t see beyond the veil
I can tell the way you run from me
I’m not your perfect fairy tale


Watch me burn
Can you feel me
Watch as I turn
What do you see



Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames

Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith
This is the Witching Hour






Don’t you see the way I look at you
I can see behind your eyes
Can’t you tell the way I reach for you
I wear my halo in disguise


I watch you burn
I can feel you
I watch as you turn
What did you do



Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames

Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith

I've wasted a lot of time and effort on motherfuckers like you
Now it's my turn

Fuck you!


You can run away from anything that you have ever done
You're a victim to the system, you're a knife and I'm a gun
You want to be a martyr but you can not take the pain
You're a voice without an echo, you're a drop and I'm the rain


You want me to just turn the other cheek
Want me to admit that I am weak
Want me to submit? That ain't me, that ain't me


You're so self righteous
And you're never going to change
You're sick and spineless
You're the fake and I'm the fame


You can't convince me life is fair
'Cause you were never even there
In the end it doesn't matter, matter at all
That's why I never really cared
'Cause I was never really scared
In the end it doesn't matter, matter, matter, no!


I want to run away from everything I've ever said
It's hard to really care when everything I love is dead
Can't take away a single thing that I have ever done
I'm learning from the burden and that's just half the fun


You want me to just turn the other cheek
Want me to admit that I am weak
Want to wear the crown? Learn to bleed, learn to bleed


You're so self righteous
And you're never going to change
You're dead and lifeless
You're a pawn within the game

Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends
I seen your ass up on TV,  touched up on them twins
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, whoa

I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy

I don't even have time for everything in my head
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot
Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots

So deep that call each others mamas' mamas

You need a bag


I know I gotta get this money 'til my dyin' soul
By the low, I come from the trenches, we was by the store
Baby, no, I don't wanna buy your love, but my heart is cold
Gotta roll, all my homies old and I keep 'em close
Lucid dream, ridin' that hemi thing, swear I do the most
Brand new fiend, she drink anything, she might need a Coke
Never sleep, gotta get to this bag, I ain't goin' broke
Wanna kick it with me, but I ain't got no legs, I been on the go
I don't go with no plan, better stick with your plan
Did you hear what I said? I don't know what you sayin'
And you know I'm the man, let's get to the deads
Let's get to some bread, better hop out in your bag


When you want a bag, you get a bag
You need a bag, you get a bag
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh 
You want a bag, you get a bag 
You need a bag, you get a bag

Pssst... psssssst... heyyoo...
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever
Tell me, which one ?


They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin to pieces, am I guilty?
I pray to the Lord but he ignores me unfortunately cuz I'm guilty
Show me a miracle I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off marijuana smoke
With every toke its like I'm losin focus
Fallin to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin nutty
And reminiscin bout them niggas that murdered my buddy...


The motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggas don't like me cuz I'm thuggin' and everyday I'm a hustler...
Lookin to get paid


I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anythin for money
Where am I goin I discovered, can't nothin save me
My next door neighbor's havin convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everydoy's dyin am I next -- who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they killin me while I'm sleepin, two to the head
While I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin suspicious
Of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway -- see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her




The bitch tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her like no other
Now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth a Hennesey I don't think it's healty
I see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfukers pass
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm loosin homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head -- and say a prayer...
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?




Then tell me am I lost cuz I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror -- and on one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and on one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay thuggin with a passion, forever blastin
I'm bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well hell can't be worse than this cuz I'm in hell now
Don't make me hurt you I don't want to -- but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
I love it cause in Heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin you now, you motherfuckers don't know me... you don't know me

Everybody knows that it's moving fast

Are just a shining artifact of the past

Before it blows and everybody knows

Was a nice middle-class nigga
But no one knew the evil he'd do when he got a little bigger
You'd often find him blazed, for puffing on a Newport
Plotting on another way to catch a case
Was only 16, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas, but you the only one ain't tellin'
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commence to money-makin' tactics, uh
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My finger's on the trigger
Tell the Lord to make way for another straight thug nigga
I'm sitting, getting buzzed, looking for some love
From the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug

An adolescent nigga standing way higher than six feet ten
He carried weight, like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on playa haters, if them mothafuckas act tuff
Then that's when, a lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast, pull the trigger
Could take the life of a young nigga, guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the nigga's all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Been laced with this game 'til it's a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear, and that ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm tryin' to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark, getting buzzed, looking for some love

No fear of what's to come

Find myself to prove I could feel love without end
I'm all that I have. I am the aftermath!

Show it no mercy, cause it cannot hurt me
No more will I bite my tongue
Tired of worthless fighting with purpose
No longer will I stay numb

We are living through such trouble times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own

Another soul is gone


And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness, or giving up, or suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing

The pain forms a circle
With a light at the center
I can see it from here, the end is coming
And all the wait, it was for nothing

I covered you in royal jelly
I made you queen and you forgave me
We'll be given the world in the right time
But we made our own and left it empty


This will be ours
'Cause we're the concept
And we're the flawed
And we're the answer


You said to me, ""It won't be long now
You'll leave the world and you will join me here""
My flesh is afraid but I am not
'Cause love now is only the pain of needing

They took your smell, they took your shadow
And I'm searching through faces for someone familiar
I clawed and I clawed, but I couldn't find you there
You wouldn't wake, I couldn't sleep for years


This will be ours
'Cause we're the concept
And we're the flawed
And we're the answer

And we're the stars
It won't be long, now
It will be ours
It will be ours


'Cause we're the cause
We're the stars
We're the cause
We're the flawed


Creation was the only word
That made you feel you never were
An endless hope is all it was
And holding sacred all they were

And don't forsake the way we were
And don't tell me you never would
And we don't need physical things to make us feel
And make us dream

When earth cracks open and swallows
Then we'll never be tired again
And we'll be given everything
The moment we realize we're not in control

And all you know gets older when
The sun goes down
And everything begins to fade away
The waves have come and taken you to sea

Never to return to me
Never to return to me
Never to return to me

Perhaps it's the colour of the sun cut flat
And coverin' the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama, you been on my mind
I do not mean you trouble, don't put me down, don't get upset
I am not pleading or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor, bowed down and bent, but yet
Mama, you been on my mind


Even though my eyes are hazy
And my thoughts, they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me, or bring me down with sorrow
I don't even mind where you be waking up tomorrow
But mama, you been on my mind


I'm not asking you to say words like yes or no
Please understand me, I've no place I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can pretend that I don't know
Mama, you been on my mind


When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind
As someone who has had you on his mind
Mama, you been on my mind

Years ago, my heart was set to live
And I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on
But guns they wait to be stuck by, at my side is God


And there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round
Ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round

There's people around who tell you that they know
And places where they send you and it's easy to go
They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row
But you know you don't have to, you can just say, ""No""


And there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round
Ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round
And there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round
Ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round


I've been built up and trusted, broke down and busted
But they'll get theirs and we will get ours if we can
Just hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on


Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh
And I've been trying hard against strong odds
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on
Well, I'll fall if I don't fight
And at my side is God


And there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round
Ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round
And there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round
Ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round

Well I came from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee
I'm going to Louisiana
My true love for to see
It had rained all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The sun so hot I froze to death
Susanna don't you cry
I got a long way to go
I sure feel it now
Deep down in these dusty clothes
Through another town
Backed up with capricious souls
I got a long way to go
I got a lot left to say
To the empty seat
The stood beside me through the fray
To the midnight moon
Who saw it fit to light my way
I got a lot left to say


But where do I got from here
When I'm lost out on the road
And the way's not clear
To find my way back home
I need to hear
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you


I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna
Coming down the hill
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
Says I'm coming from the south
Susanna don't you cry




Soon we'll be in New Orleans
Then I'll look around
And when I find Susanna
I'll fall down on the ground
And if I do not find her
Then I shall surely die
And when I'm dead and buried
Susanna Don't you cry for me

Okay
This is a song about how I used to get really scared around girls
And it goes like this


Won't you please let me
Back to your heart?

Won't you please let me 

Back to your heart 


'04, seventh grade
High top Adidas and I thought I had game
But it turns out that I didn't and I learned the hard way
When I walked up to this girly and I asked her ""What's your name?""
She said ""Don't, stop! Why are you talking to me?
You're the new kid in town and you look like you're three
And it's easy to see by your pale-ass skin
That you're always home alone, McCauley Caulkin""
I need consultin' for all of my fears
'Cause I didn't have another girl for four more years
And they gave me every one of their gracing chances
Paid no attention to all their advances
But freshman in college I found my first love
And I took her out to dinner and I thanked the gods above
But when she went to give me a kiss had a pain in my stomach
Too much food, had to vomit




Won't you please let me
Back to your heart

Won't you please let me 
Back to your heart

But they say ""nice guys finish last""
So I gotta be an ass if I win my class

Give a rapper a chance
Somebody make sure that she's hearing this

Sent me to the army of Brooklyn, those bastards

They couldn't survive the heat
Just like the mavericks
And I dont buy wolf tickets from niggas
But niggas be wolfin so i walk around on my clippers
Some of my people was alive from my struggle
But ain't lived to see my success
They wanted to see me make it, but got stripped naked
And layed in the mall cuz of death
So yo now im successful how can i celebrate it?
They died early, so in their eyes I never made it

Brook a mirror, i ain't get 7 years of bad luck

Put my hat on the bed when i walked in the room
Swept my feet, and i ain't even spit on the broom
What im try'na say is, Im not supersticious
Akon what am I ?

My right hand itchin, been havin money kid
I even opened the unbrella in da crib
Bought my girl some shoes, she ain't walk outta my life
No bad luck, I skipped the po twice
No superstition, just wise intuition
On the battle field get killed or do the killin
By the way my good luck charm is a bisquit

I am a critic
Of my only critical need to define myself
With wine, and words, and lovers
And friends who don't understand
So there, I just said it
You know that admitting the problem is the first step
Towards repair, ""We all recover, ""
Say the friends turned to wine-drunk lovers


Smile, tell me I'm alright
With a goodbye
You are so misleading
A kiss or a gun fight
High-noon or midnight
Darling, I don't want to know
If I'm just a short sight on a cold night
The canals are freezing
So tell me I'm alright with a goodbye


Am I a villain?
Cast among heroes with all of their
Underwhelming overbearing struggles
To become what they'll never be?
Friends to the wicked
Caution is calling, but nobody's home
The lights are off, the party's over
Now you're stuck plucking three-leaf clovers




You've got the high ground
And I'm on my best defense
But I dare you to come down
I'll give you an eye for an eye
If it makes things easy...




Smile, tell me I'm alright
With a goodbye

"In days of old, when ships were bold
Just like the men who sailed them
And if they showed us disrespect
We'd tie them up and flail them
Often men of low degree
And often men of steel
They'd make you walk the plank alone
Or haul you 'round the keel

And your money we shall have

Of all the pirates on the seas
The worst of them was Blackbeard
So damnable a fiend from Hell
He was the one they most feared
Any man who sailed with him
Was taking quite a chance
He'd hang them from the gallows
Just to see if they could dance

Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up


Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language

You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it


Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills

Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around

With this new haircut
What am I to do?
Just another ringing alarm

Something lustful bores a hole
Formed from doubt and worthless plans
Oh, this blight takes all

Are we homeward bound?
I know what can be blessed
When I heard that lost song

Be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you?

And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself


You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well, I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth, I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath, I think it's a lot of yearning

To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out

Than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
Than to burn in the spotlight 
Turn in the spitfire 
Scream without making a sound 
Be up here and without looking down 
Because we're all afraid of heights

See the evil spread disease and fear to all

Through the centuries
Blood shall be the key
Now a leader of our destiny

As his army rose

From the battle he will rain fires of hell from the sky

Bringer of the fire
For the great empire
Rising power of the fallen warriors' souls

Steel crushing steel, see the great fire descend from the sky
Never surrender, one day we'll be free
Flee from the swarm, through the forces of terror
No sacrifice 'til the end

From beyond the grave
Crush them into dust, a life of worthless slaves

Now we shall avenge a thousand warriors' souls

She's the kind of trouble that I don't mind


She yells at everybody just come on along
Party at my place just follow the truck
We'll be cutting a rug until the sun comes up
She's a little slice of heaven, hell on heels
And never going to walk the line
Oh but she's the kind of that I don't mind

Let's talk about loneliness
You know sometimes it can fool you
Into believing you're on top of the world
No one can top you or stop you
And everything you've ever wanted
Is right at your fingertips

But, as always
Reality steps in and shocks you
Right back into the present
And all you can do is ask yourself over and over
Why?

What happened to the love that brought us both
So much joy and happiness?
Oh hey, I know things change
People change
But this hurts
I mean it really hurts

I guess it all boils down to the fact
That we never really knew each other anyway, huh?
Yeah, I know
Say, wait a minute, let me tell exactly how I feel, ok?


Today I'm just a lonely man
But tommorow I'll be a king
Blessing all my subjects
Cast afar and securities
The whole wide world will watch me
As I walk up to my throne
Nights in shining armor
Stand around to heed my call


But wait a minute
I'm still lonely 
I guess anyone can dream
But when you lose someone it seems
So unimportant
Although every person changes
Different times and differrent ways
But never all the same


Why 
Have I lost you 
Why 
Tell me ooohhhhhhh
Although every person changes
Different times and differrent ways
Why 
Tell me ooohhhhhhh

Why?
Why have I lost you baby?

I've been so lonely

In you, baby

She said what she wants is a man to be faithful
A true heart somebody willing and able
To stay by her side through thick and thin
A tender touch every now and then
She's not hung up on fairy tales
Or some dream at the bottom of a wishing well
Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things


That's what she gets

Stare at her laying by my side
Knowing there in her heart as she sleeps

Do you remember the story of the boy and his first date?
She took him to the lake and he fell in love
She spent one summer waking up between his arms
She told him how good that felt, told him he was the one
And then she went away, his calls were not returned
He went to see her, but her eyes were burning a different stare
The focus was somewhere else
And that feeling had somehow disappeared


Do you remember when they both drove out of state?
Stealing kisses behind her cousin's back
With a love so strong, tell me who could wait?
When it seems so right and it feels so right
Man, it had to be right
With a love so strong, tell me who could wait?
When it seems so right and it feels so right
Man, it had to be right 


With a love so strong, tell me who could wait?
When it seems so right and it feels so right

And I'm pretty sure that boy is staying in tonight

Ran out of chances when I ran out of luck

Riding with a head full of buckets of red
And when they said still stuck in the head
A thoroughbred thoroughly bled
And led to the land of the mental combats
Following a front attack so you can never run from that

The planet sizing up the horizon
Smaller than a fly stand, I'm a lyrical lamp
The power that I got on my cynical hand
With a pen, once again

Swimming in the center of the hit or the miss
Reeling in my thoughts getting lost in the mist
Realizing one not the size of the fist
And the killing of the killer with a flick of the wrist


I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them

I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head


The second it's gone
The weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
Eternity-you have not- So in that, you can't fight nor flee
Still, you'd be around if it wasn't for me

Way back first whatever my friends
That you see the attraction of the payback
Don't want me to say that, playback the thing now
Getting lost in the chaos tossing it down

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic in my confine

Hungry for a head full of hectic

My box is full
And my mouth is full
And my life is full
And now my memory's full


In how many ways and words
Can you say nothing
Millions of ways and words
To say nothing


What'd I say? I'm empty


I bought the thing
I taught the thing
And I fought the thing


They said it's normal
But they're keeping me dumb and hot
You're missing something
Keeping me dumb and hot
You must be missing something
Keeping me dumb and hot




And I'm sending it back to you

When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world


In the morning from the minute that I wake up
What if I don’t want to put on all that make up?
Who says I must conceal what I’m made of?
Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem
Whose job is it to straighten out my curves?
I’m so tired of that image, that’s my word
What if today I don’t feel like putting heels on?
Who are you to criticize when beauty’s only in the eyes…
Of the beholder, so behold her
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, why, oh?


When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world


Uh, uh, I’m so secure with insecurities
Why is being unique such an impurity?
Why are the numbers on the scale like a God to me?
All of these indifferences are based on our appearances
We please to be appeased
The truest pleasure is the fact that we can breathe
Think it into existence, do it, then achieve
A fairy tale reality, beauty was with a beast
Ah, ah, ah, I’m the image of your reflection
Uh, uh, uh, you’re the image of my reflection
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, why, oh?


When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

If there's a God
Do you think he's looking down, curled up on his couch right now?
As we fail to figure it out, does he turn down the sound?
Is he proud? Are we proud?
Guess we forgot how to live a life with no filter
Making boring people famous
Let's pretend they're fascinating
Let's tell little girls that pretty girls are better
Or that pigment or religion really matters


We're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created could make for some good TV


Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs
I know you're tuning in up there, way up there
Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made
Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days


Does he hang his head at all the greed that we possess?
As the anti-social media perpetuates the mess
Maybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the loose ends
Stressed like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us
God, or is it Mr. G to me?
I hope that through the static, you’ll show us the clarity
'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet
Wonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep
Do you sleep in peace?


'Cause we're in some trouble
Mr. Maker, but don't turn away from your screen
At least the bubble that we've created has made for damn good TV

Would you care to answer my question?
Oh, the land of poor taste
The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made
Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days


Don't touch the remote, we'll be back in a moment
We are not hopeless, we are just coping
The mayhem is rolling, but it ain't showbiz
Reality's potent, chaotic, I know it
But we're growing, have some hope in us
And were we worth all the time you gave up?


Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs

Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit'cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha


Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha


I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha

To the young mothers
I feel ya, I know how it is

Don't nobody understand
I feel ya


She was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls
A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
Was only fifteen, should have been a beauty queen, still
See her cryin' by the caskets when her parents got killed
Little girl don't cry, cuz even though they died
You can best believe they're watchin' over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery, but look at what you're gettin'
It's a blessin' in disguise when you find out you're pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you're all alone
You gots to do this on your own, so baby gone
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when you're fightin' the world
Facin' all this drama when Mama's just a little girl


And mama's just a little girl



At sixteen
What a beautiful thing, the very essence of a jet-black ebony queen
And who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age?
She didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise
Hey, got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate, I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited
Though it takes time to build a body and a mind
She reclines nine months then finally it's time
What do we find?, little growin' boy of mine
With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime
Had no time for the growin' stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police, don't come home, why?
Cuz Mama's actin' crazy at the hospital
'Bout to have another baby
Like a rose from the concrete, growin' within
Blessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men?
So we began, closest family, such insanity
A happy home, from one act of inhumanity
Plus Mama said the seed was corrupted
Used to rub her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us
Now, Mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint Schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops 
How could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama
Cause Mama's just a little girl



Mama's just a little girl



Now, will she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot
Now, look here, I see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt
Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfilled prophecy
But who could stop the grief I walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me
I'd probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse?, nothing but pain, since my birth
Only functions at the Pen', cuz everybody's in
Payin' back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted
I wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it
Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried
Worried and scared, knowin' I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares
No! It ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share
In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand
Mama told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want? 
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my Mama in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl



See mammas just a little girl

Mama's just a little girl
Facing all this drama, cuz mama's just a little girl


They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do

They wonder why we hold such little worth for human life

To ask us why we turn from bad to worse
Is to ignore from which we came

You see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals

On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses

This is the concrete

And these are my damaged petals

Don't ask me why

Thank God, nigga

Ask me how

You see, Mama's just a little girl

The whole world done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, aww shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, thug nigga
Stressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die

Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven

The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires stroke his precious pavement
The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes
In Volkswagen vans with full running boards
Dragging great anchors, followin' dead-end signs into the sores
The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore
Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain
She rubs against the weatherbeaten frame and asks the angel for his name
Off in the distance the marble dome reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown

And the outcome will be the same every time

Dead bodies and silence, give it to you raw

Shootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin' crazed devil
Mash shit from here to here, day by day, year to year
Made niggas on your motherfuckin' tear: I'm a made nigga


Call me a Bad Boy killer, murder motherfuckers daily
Know the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli
Gettin' lessons from niggas in penitentiaries
Game, when applied, help me survive several centuries
Lock me in a cage, I'll display my rage
Surround the court buildin' with the gauge and spray
They wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced
On my knees to God, beggin' for repentance
I'm so convinced that I'm a thug
They got me fiendin' for my cash
Like a fiend when he dreams of drugs
Diss the dada and I'll kidnap your daughter
Kill your wife and hit the funeral
And tell you just who gave the order
Makaveli the Don 'til I'm gone
I maintain my army of lunatics that stay armed
'Til the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga
Outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga

Get into the mind of a made nigga, I can't be touched
My adversaries get fucked, feel me?

Roots dig deep while we sleep
Snakes in veins, valves decay

Cast the first stone from behind the throne
Crown of thorns now overgrown
All our wants and needs bring us to our knees
Can't turn back now, the seeds are sown


Seven billion, one of a kind
Collide together, intertwined
National lines used to define
Where we draw the enemy lines


Cast the first stone from behind the throne

I've dodged the flame of love, my heart's been slippery and cold
I always thought I'd walk this path, at least until I was almost old
Those sweet lips and eyes of green cut me like a blade of steel
Pull my heart like an eighteen wheel running up a Tennessee hill


I was a rolling stone, my feet never touch the ground
She was the only one that ever could tie me down


Feel like I left behind, trapped to an angel's wings
Bounded to a new born love, tied up in the apron strings
I used to live alone, never needed anyone
And she turned my head around, I didn't even try to run




Looking back, I realize happy is not what I was
When you run across a woman
It's your true love that stronger than a moonshine buzz

Was on my mind

And she was taking her time


What if she came to me
Would she be kind?
And if she stayed with me
Do you think that
She'd like to do anything
I would, or would she leave me?


Lately I've found myself
Losing my mind
Knowing how badly I need her
It's something hard to find

Does she want to go?

Does she want it?

I hope it can work out tonight wasssup
I know we been seein' each other for a long time
And  I'm hopin' tonight can be the night
Yeah, that's right


Another shady mission, had enough of shady tricks
You're so suspicous like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I'll die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, ‘cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one, or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right


If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night


I'm always in the mix
Life is full of tricks
I guess, tryin' my best
Nothing less, before I lay to rest
My quest and future I'm mourn like a new born baby
Intense and seldom to the world I'm so crazy
My daddy raised me to be a man, do the best I can
He said you won't succeed in life without a plan
It's hard to take my people trade me
With Indian hate, can't wait better change before it's too late


They got me at the bottom of a deck, searching for my Ace
I can't take too many chances, ain't much love in my place
Full of torment and soul, and it's written all in my face
Hollow inside, a crooked smile is the only trace
A mission slightly incomplete
Misconceptions of success and defeat
I roam these dark streets alone
Searching for yo homie, smokin' til I'm gone
When I need someone to kind of lay my burdens on


If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night


December 30 in nineteen-ninety feen yeah
My reincarnation steps in, born into a world that don't love itself, but the love is wealth
My little nigga listen closely, if you don't remember nothing else
Just remember that life ain't nothing but a game
A gamble, and how you play yo hand will sho' explain
For what's ever
In times you gone journey into a crossroad, get lost tho'
Keep on bailin' and let 'em see you up in floss mode


Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams
It's all wrong,  Pop too long gone
And now way it seems I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in a zone
Protect my throne
Pow like king Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Living life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton
With my future behind me, livin' with these snakes
Sent here to blind me, one day I know my future's gonna find me
Am I crying?


If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night


Would you be patient, and you take your time
And you finess it, 9 times out of 10

But if you rush and you just be manhandlin'

I think that's why this song means so much to me
When I was young
My dad would say
""C'mon son, let's go out and play""
Sometimes it seems like yesterday
And I'd climb up the closet shelf
When I was all by myself
Grab his hat and fix the brim
Pretending I was him
No matter, how hard I try
No matter, how many tears I cry
No matter, how many years go by
I still can't say goodbye
He always took care
Of Mom and me
We all cut down a Christmas tree
He always had some time for me
Wind blows through the trees
Street lights, they still shine bright
Most things are the same
But I miss my dad tonight
I walked by a Salvation Army store
Saw a hat like my daddy wore
Tried it on when I walked in
Still trying to be like him
No matter, how hard I try
No matter, how many years go by
No matter, how many tears I cry

Sing a call to a morning dove
Over the prairie, through the hills
I hear it still in the singing of the bread
From your lips which splashed my dull house
With music


I went out walking in the wood
By a river which never sleeps
All I bare, all I sieve
I thought of you so presently


I dreamt of the warmest days of love
Which knew not sorrow nor betrayal
When truth was will in the singing of the gale
But when I lay in a verdant field
None could stay my rising


I went out walking in the wood
And the light casts long from the moon
And life is short as a breath half-taken
I could not wait to tell you the truth


I have been waiting on you

I got one more piece to show you, my Derringer
I keep it in the small of my back
It's a two shot, it's chrome, my initials engraved in it

Look at you now, you had to get it
Your BM? I'm takin' it, shit, you don't need it
Park it where I can watch it at and see if it got low jack
Then take it to the chop shop to my Man Kojak
He gon' give me more cream so I can cop mo' gats

I was at Coachella, leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it, 'cause, baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin', they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night


'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time


I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven 
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it 
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend 
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question


I was at Coachella, leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds


What about all these children and all their children's children
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way


I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven 
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it 
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend 
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question


A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for?

And all you did is cut me dead

Hold one's peace or should I shout?
Hold it in or let it out?

I have gone through a bad spell
Now listen to me

Please stop asking me how I am today
This is nothing I would call fine
This was the last time
In this battle of mine

I will let it out

Am I still the cold winter morning?

If you ask me: how are you?
I would always say quite well

I have gone through a bad spell

Completely shattered; that's the price we pay
Sometimes the truth makes everything else seem like a lie
Makes everything seem like a lie

And my galaxy came raining down
Still looking for a life, but I'm still alone

If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood


As soon as the beat drop
Within two bars, you already said I'm hot
They savor, my fruits of labor
My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo
To go against me you gotta be more than professional
You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
And I be fucking all these bars
We be sexing I'm a nympho
For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it
Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap
Take this and take that from the machine
Got this money up, with no caffeine
Prepare me is Kerosene struck by a bunch of lightening
You looking at me then your sight seeing
And what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate
I'm authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood


I see the future better than your computers
Apple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger
Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
Leave them dead inside the sewers
Shoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer
Burning up the very sun, the rapture
The god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster
I'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield
The nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on
Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb
Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect
If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check
Preach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying
King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
Because I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Soundwave and he gives me beats by the batch


I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood


My flow cold, like Aspen
I love to show off when I'm in that Aston
Look I act a ass, but I'm not jack
A east side nigga I can get you popped at
A hundred rounds nigga stop that
You can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back
I'm too gutta nigga top that
This is lyrical homicide, not rap
So don't get it misunderstood
Say my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood
With 45 goons 45 shugs
Chase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof
I see you big dogs, all I hear is woof
Loud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss
I'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life
Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night
I just might...


...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
For the top dog catalog, that means everybody
Several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers
Damn I hate rappers, don't call me that
If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
I don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real
Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
Hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill

Put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head
Tell them about the g-code, like eskimos

Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer


And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire


And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town


There's no one left in the world

Don't give a fuck if I go

There was Adam, there was Eve
And there was someone else around
Yeah, I think his name was Steve
And he was passing through town
When he heard a snake a-whispering

""Take the fruit, it's good for you""
Steve said, ""I beg your pardon
I know it's not my business
But will you just hear me out""


He said, ""I wouldn't lie
You should not go to that tree

Oh, you want what you can't have
But you've got all the things you need""

Don't risk it all for a taste
Oh, what a waste
To have everything and give it all away""


Adam looked around and as he wrestled with his fate
Steve and Eve rolled up their sleeves to wrestle with that snake
In the midst of all the chaos
Steve was still screaming out

Run up on a real motherfucker and get tossed
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin' jimmy
Broke hoes runnin' round yellin' ""Gimme!""

Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK
So how about hittin' a motherfucker on my pager
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later
Fly how I fade her, played her like a game of Sega
Fuckin' with the player that done made her, huh
And I ain't sleepin' caught you creepin' for my money
Got the dick and now you get the pistol honey 
She get the bozack, knockin' hoes back, keep my dough stacked
So where the motherfuckin' hoes at?

Holdin' on to a dream, unknown destination
Feels like a thousand miles 'til another station
Woah-oh
Far out beyond the prying eyes and neon sky
The answers quickly multiply
And ideas begin to fly



How many journeys on this trip?
I say, how much time 'til I live to R.I.P.?
I don’t wanna die, just give me six
Six more lives 'til I feel equipped
Take the names of the sycophants
Smash their dreams into little bits
I don’t wanna die, just give me six
Six more lives 'til I feel equipped


Not for the faint of heart
It will not be painless
You’ll take your licks and you’ll never come out stainless
Woah-oh
Outlandish dreams can come to pass, it happens so fast
There’s no end to what you can achieve
But first you gotta believe



It wasn’t overnight, it wasn’t do you right
It was A to B and those label fights
Oh yeah, money tight, five appetites
Have you seen those guys? They’re quite a sight
Now here go the sweat, here go the set
Hear all the songs in our alphabet
Almost 30 years of blood sweat and tears
Still got the drive, still got that gear


Be sure, a discouraging word will be heard
It doesn’t matter what they will say
The naysayers will do what they do
But to thine own self be true


This is what we came to say
The forces that be are on our side
The truth is something you can’t hide
Give us what we came for
Give us what we came for
On the right side of history
When we first came with the unity
Give us what we came for
This is what we came to say
It’s what we came for, it’s what we came for
It’s what we came for, it’s what we came to say

We will not lose heart
Even though this present age will waste away
We will surely suffer, but it's a slight momentary trouble
The deconstruction is painful, but the transformation is beautiful
When we the children of God are crushed under the heavy affliction of this world, be reminded that it's weightless in comparison to the eternal measure of God's glory
We have lost our eyes for the unseen and have swallowed the false hope of the visible
We must realize the empty grave and revel in the certainty of His resurrection with assurance of renewal, considering it worthy to suffer for the faith
So we will worship while we wait

I like my steak well done, my taters fried
Football games on Monday night

I don't like caviar, sushi bars

In the pouring rain
I will be the same
When you're wandering
You and I will still remain
You'll run to hide
Deep in the night
Give up the fight
I am always on your side


In the pouring rain
I will never change
When you feel afraid
I am there to bear the weight
I'll turn the tide
Open the sky
You'll be alright
I am always on your side


I am enough, always enough
You are enough, precious and loved
Morning will come, sure as the Son
I am enough, you are enough
You are enough


In the middle of the pouring rain
I will call your name
When your soul sways
On and off and on again
You'll change your mind
But still be mine
We're intertwined
I am always by you


I am enough, always enough
You are enough, precious and loved
Morning will come, sure as the Son

I'm usually strong, keep love far away
A wall around my heart, so it won't have to break
But you take me some place that I've never been
Now don't know if I'll find my way back again


'Cause you've got me right where I want you
And there's not a thing I can do
Completely consumed, all about you
You've got me right where I want you


When I close my eyes you're looking at me
You wake me at night, walking around in my dreams
The wind blows the smell of the roses in bloom
And all I can think of is last nights perfume




And I never thought that I would get caught
But here I am wrapped up in you

And there's not a thing I can do

When thugs cry
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Got us dyin'
When thugs cry, times is hard


Born thuggin', and lovin' the way I came up
Big money clutchin', bustin' while evadin' cocaine busts
My pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity
They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family
The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried
I got a line on the D.A. ‘cause I'm fuckin' his secretary
I black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panic, and bitches duckin', I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
I'll probably be an old man before I understand
Why I have to live my life with pistols close at hand
Kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad
They even raped her, so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out, on every block
They puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops
I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin'
What is the meanin' when thugs cry?


Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God 
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?


Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
Where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggas I used to love, enclosed in Penitentiaries
But still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel
To lose your life, over something that you did as a kid?
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song
To help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches
We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine, mayne
See, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See, you gotta get high or die, ‘cause even thugs cry


Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?


And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures
Bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
‘Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don
I write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?
So merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams
Leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood
Clownin', takin' pictures later
Laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches
Regulate my area, the terror I represent
Makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went
Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer!
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes; when thugs cry


Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise

For my dead homeboys and my prison peers
Y'all ain't never heard my cries
Now you wonder why would you die?


Ayy Nas, remember that shit you said? I don't know what magazine you said it on... Some shit about we're sending thugs to whoever & whenever. You need to go to the record store and check out some of the albums you've been putting out, because you been spitting this thug shit for a while now.

"Told a lie about yourself
It felt so good to decieve
You pulled the wool over everyone
Told them whatever they'd believe

You missed the train and now you're gone
To join the faceless everyone
You're a name on a phone list I've crossed off
I've pushed you back to square one

And if I fall then I'll stand back up
Because learning how to run is half the fun
Somehow I know that there must be something better
No one's gonna have power over me

If there's a sign above the door 
That says you have to hang your coat
But you're wanting me to pay the doorman with my soul
I think that I'll be moving on

Your witch's web is hanging over my sleep
My one half lies awake, the other in a dream
Somehow I know that there must be something better
No one's gonna have power over me

A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused?
All included but you, alone

Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen and change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue

Be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way


Flowers watched through wide eyes bloom
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon

It comes this way, it comes this way
To drown this ache
To reinstate 
 Take your place

Tryin' to keep it just like before

At times when I never even thought to speak
Don't want to tell you what it is
Ooh wee, it felt so serious
Got me thinkin' just too much, I wanna, set it off, but..


It's this one thing, that got me trippin'
It's this one thing, that got me trippin'
 It's this one thing my soul made me feel it
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh
It's this one thing, that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
It's this one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh


Hey, we don't know each other well
So why I keep pickin' up my cell?
Memories, just keep ringing bells
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh
Hear voices, I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clickin' towards your door
Oh-wo-wo-wo-wo-wooo



Bridge :
And maybe I just can't believe it
It's this one thing you did
I can't deny, time and time, even left door
But to keep on seeing you
I'm hoping you can keep a secret

Did what you diiiiiiiiid, yeah

Oh-oh-oh-oh-OHHH 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-OHHH 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-OHHH 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-OHHH!


Slipped up, let you in my space, got a chick stuck
Close my eyes, see your face, that's a bit much
I ain't the type to get strung all out
Now when I sit and dial your number, got my tongue all out
Wouldn't never tell you though, emotions I would never show
Gotta keep it to myself, gotta keep it low
You got me trippin', who you thought it would be?
Keep it knockin' with E-V-E and Amerie, c'mon

"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling, cold towel, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind

The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one


Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh, ""It's the madness in his eyes""
As he breaks the night to cry:


It's really me
Really you and really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you and really Me
You'll lose me, though I'm always
Really free


And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud


And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand


And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
""Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down""
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face

Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground

Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles

And point away from the past

And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes
Must meet the dawn
And if I see the day
I’d only have to stay
So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone

Oh, every thought that’s strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung
But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes
It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung
But the time ain’t tall, if on time you depend
And no word is possessed by no special friend
And though the line is cut
It ain’t quite the end
I’ll just bid farewell 'til we meet again

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me

And the point is slick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick

I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best

Culminating just to be this well-versed leader before you

A course of a lifetime you'll never forget
I'll show you how to in eight easy steps
I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best


How to lie to yourself and thereby to everyone else
How to keep smiling when you're thinking of killing yourself
How to numb a la holic to avoid going within
How to stay stuck in blue by blaming them for everything

You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
So I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So I'll play it dirty until your body is breaking


We've got to make love, the time is right
We've got to make love tonight
Because we're burning up


You make me greedy, you won't feed me my food
But I'll make out easy, because I see straight through you
You cool me off and hot me up and that's not right
Because you'll get hungry in the heat of the night


And then we'll make love, just when it's right
And when we make love tonight
We'll be burning up


I know you feel the same
I know you feel the flame
Staring deep inside of you
Burning you up, breaking you down
Breaking you out in a cold sweat
And as you lose control, of your very soul
Your desire takes over
You'll feel the heat sway
You're round to my way
And suddenly you'll know that you're burning up
You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
So I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So I'll play it dirty until your body is breaking

A Tribe Called Quest came to drop jewels wit' ease
Plus make you party, we do this music thing for everybody
Black, White, Latino and Asian, we cold raisin'
The stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau
To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
A god-fearin' folk cos we all from the yolk
Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed
Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence
Even though not too long ago I was a truant
Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics
From man's obsession with money to holy prophets
Like Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky
Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats
Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat
But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?
It's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable
I be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet
And fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it


Now every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year
All you gat pullin' MC's could never come near
All that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest
It's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess
So I even start to  when you know you have no 
Wit' your simpleton , your light-hearted 
Step back, me no have no time for dat
I'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots
In a world where you have like a zillion MC's
Ninety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs
Bitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know
I be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low
 I label myself as The Boss 
Same height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross
Queens representation, son, you know how we do
While Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest
I be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat
Yo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that
My motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop
Come on party people, you must give me my props
Cos y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered
So head for the border you peasy-haired bastards
Before I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?
Queens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner

From the fire of this place

I'mma freak from the door way, love a short stay
Takin' trips on the hot sands, I got plans
Champagne all the top brands, let's lock hands
Let me teach you all the right moves, wit ice cubes
It's a nice view, sex'll make you skip night school
And though I like you, also like the things you do
The way you chew, how you move when I bring you through
At the cafe, sippin' on some Crist & Zae
Four course entre, wit the fish fillette
So what you feel when I'm close to ya, keep it real
Who the nigga mean the most to ya, what the deal?
Let's enjoy it while we still here, handle wit care
And we can do this like a Willie affair

CHORUS

Alright... alright... yeah, ah, e, ah... come get your love tonight...

Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, I'd rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine 'cross the line
My two 9's go BIYA BIYA when I shoot 'em
Korean motherfuckers was crooked
So niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas
.. uhh, straight take his life
So don't sleep when my team creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip cause we did 'em
Lickin off shots for Latasha, that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now?
I packed a 9 last year, in '99 I'm packing two now
And even if they pull they triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothing's gonna stop the plan of true niggas


 Yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us
 Yeah, niggas
Cause bein a nigga means you love niggas, haha
 I was raised in this society so there's no way you can
Expect me to be a perfect person, cause I'mma do what I'mma do

 HA!!! Uhh..
Aiyyo!


My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em Bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is headshots
Your last words'll be, damn, what's all these red dots?
Niggas nowadays they worry me
My bars is therapy, as long as you usin 'em thoroughly
Muah 'til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be
And I'm a product of the 70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin wit'chu I'm probably beefin wit'chu
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin wit'chu
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin you keep it wit'chu
Cause unfortunately I'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol
And know what the llama do
Shady/Aftermath, Ruff Ryders, D Block, and of course Amaru
Lot of people honor you, probably cause the way
That you used to bring the drama to, whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But, anyway, life goes on
So I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do


 Yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us
 Yeah, niggas
Cause bein a nigga means you love niggas, haha
 I was raised in this society so there's no way you can
Expect me to be a perfect person, cause I'mma do what I'mma do

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice , nice

Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fuckin' right 
In your thong, smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song 
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch, I'm tatted out my shirt, so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt, then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, aye


Ohhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Nooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhh, fuck is you talkin' 'bout? My shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole
For eternity, so they can reap what they sow
Ohhh, I don't think I can do nothin' but flow
Nooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhh, I don't know why you in love with me, ho
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
I'm in the zone, I'm all on my own

Hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right
They're playing out a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
Always taking, baby, but that's okay
What they're giving maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once, you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face


We are screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace


Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load


We are screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace


So you wait it out, bideyour time
Rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it, but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever, then I tell you I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate


We are screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace


Screaming, screaming vengeance
Screaming, vengeance, screaming

As we were talking outside, it was cold
We were shivering yet warmed by the subject matter
“my wife is in the next room. we’ve been having troubles, you know. please, don’t tell her or anyone, but I need to talk to somebody”
You said “Wouldn’t it be a shame if I knew how great I was five minutes before I died? I’d be filled with such regret before I took my last breath”
And I said “You’re willing to tell me this now, and you’re not going to die any time soon”
And I said “I haven’t been eating chicken or meat or anything”
And you said “Yes, but you’ve been wearing leather”, and laughed and said “We’re at the top of the food chain, and yes, you’re still a fine woman”
I cringed


I was hoping, I was hoping we could heal each other
I was hoping, I was hoping we could be raw together


We left the restaurant where the head waiter, in his 60s, said “Goodbye, sir. Thank you for your business, sir. You’re
Successful and established, sir. And we like the frequency with which you dine here, sir… and your money”
And when I walked by, they said “Thank you too, dear”
I was all pigtails and cords, and there was a day when I would’ve said something like “Hey, dude, I could buy and sell this place, so kiss it”
I too once thought I was owed something


I was hoping, I was hoping we could challenge each other
I was hoping, I was hoping we could crack each other up


I too thought that, when proved wrong, I lost somehow, and
I too once thought life was cruel, and
It’s a cycle really, you think I’m withdrawing and guilt-tripping you
I think you’re insensitive, and I don’t feel heard, and I said
“Do you believe we are fundamentally judgmental? fundamentally evil?”, and you said “yes”
I said “I don’t believe in revenge, in right or wrong, good or bad”
You said “Well, what about that man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency room bleeding after beating his kid, and she threw a shoe at his head. I think what he did was wrong and I would’ve had a hard time feeling compassion for him”
I had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged


I was hoping, I was hoping we could dance together
I was hoping, I was hoping we could be creamy together

And as my footsteps drew me closer
I could smell the sweet fragrance of flowers

It look like a family reunion
Had my eyes not counted the tears
And an old man sat by a graveside
I haven't seen Mary in years

Hold my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary

We had such plans for our child
But for no reason I started ramblin'
Like the four winds I just ran wild

If I could live our life over
I'd bring Mary such cheer
Now she's gone where she'll never meet me

Hold my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here

I just want to thank President Agent Orange

For perpetuating all of the evil that you've been perpetuating throughout the United States

I want to thank President Agent Orange for his successful attempt at the Muslim ban
When we come together

We the people



We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-brother mood
When we get hungry we eat the same  food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a brother gettin' commas
Brothers in my hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, so it's not no hole
Trendsetter, ayo, I know it's cold
Top 5 yo if I could be so bold
But now you


All of the bad folks, you must go

All of my poor folks, you must go

And all of them Mexicans, you must go

Muslims and gays

Boy, we hate your ways


All of our rap folk you must go


Phife Dawg!


The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the - block


Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop


All of my black folks, you must go

All of my poor folks, you must go

And all of ya Mexicans, you must go

Any different people can apply to drop the funk
It's not a country club review board steady talkin junk
Many people would have it others go put and grab it
Some trip over toots and say fuck it I'm sunk
I put it in a limerick and kick the slick nick verbs
I am the one who scores the herb
When we're on the road P-Nut rolls it up
Throw me a joint on stage what's up
I will tell a cop that I know my fucking rights
And we can match wits all night for real
He said if I had nothing to hide
Then of course I wouldn't mind if he looked through our ride
Uh, no I'd really rather you didn't
And no we don't have guns hidden
We stood there for a while continue to
Decline
Firmly, I didn't lose my mind
I didn't let him break me he's just another human
Not a bit of shame in what we were doin' that day
He couldn't make us stay
We had our shit together
It don't matter whether
We sport the dread locks or a shaved head
Or if we have a sticker from the dead
I said a better verse rehearsed about the roughneck curse
Last week I keep an even keel and bow in place
And face the music every minute


Never could see my homey comin' till he passed
Funky gas by my way all the day I couldn't laugh
Oh by now I'm chill with it
Bare ass in my face I'm ok but Chad's like ""Uh-uh no he isn't""
So I proceed to hear him get loose with the
Fartin' all over my face sometimes my tummy
He fucked with my flow although I thought it funny
I probably wouldn't care if I smoked more kind bud
But that wouldn't do me shit cuz then he'd fuck me more up
Crazy ill and chillin' rude but I'ze a real cool dude
He didn't believe the day would come when he would get his too
But then one day right in front of his face I got him
He looked over said ""God damn get me some water""
The one time I hadn't wasted till I got mine
Smeared his nose with my armpit funk slime
So you get it the picture just how sick we were then
But before I jet ""Hey yo Chad sniff my finger man""


I can see a lot of people who feel like I do
I can see a lot of people who feel like I don't
I go on step lightly even when I'm heavy
High jump the slump open up for the Reverend Horton Heat
Sweet what am I displayin' forgot what I was saying
I know I must be laying a pipe you got a gripe
With the way I get high
Graffix bong sing along with a cry of a
Mandatory sentence for a crime with no victim
When everybody knows jail terms should be picked in
Order of the pain that they cause
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
Until you violate the rights of another
Respect the space of your sister and your brother
The war on drugs may be well intentioned
But it falls fucking flat when you stop and mention
The overcrowded prisons where a rapists gets paroled
To make room for a dude who has sold
A pound of weed to me that's a crime
Here's to good people doin time y'all

You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Mama... 
Dear Mama... 
Mama, yeah...


Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Mama... 
Dear Mama... 
Mama, yeah...


Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Mama, yeah...

I do not fuck with the middlemen
I do not fuck with you little men 
Causin' a massive attack 
Off of a track with my synonyms 
Nobody holdin' me back

With the weed, I'm smokin' on grade A

Long ago I wandered through my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusion!


Soon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusion!


Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears


So I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah, when you're gone!

I thought I knew you, took the time to throw my love into you
Screw you, 'cause now you got me sitting in the sewer
I'm through with all them roller coaster rides
See I ain't forgot about the knots that you've been tying with my insides
I dropped my pride, without you I was sure to die
I tried with cash and all I could to make it last
Now I accepted that was in the past
I know you love me, love me like a piece of trash
But at first you were so sweet
Couldn't go without seeing your face for an hour, so sour
It all became a hassle you were even living in my castle
Just to use me and verbally abuse me
That's not the way I'm running my shop
It took a while to see the light before I stopped and you got dropped off
It's over, probably I'll be sweating it
But in the long run you'll be the one regretting it
Maybe you won't, maybe you will
But baby you're still about as real as a three dollar bill


There's no one to blame but you
And who gets the blame? Me
There's no one to blame but you
And who gets the blame? Me

With all that anger that I'm feeling bitch I think it's heat
Another split tail, just another split tail
Thanks for the lesson now get your shit and hit the trail
We know I'm coming from the old school you damn fool
Intensity is something that I'm made of
And certainly I'm not afraid of a little smack in my face
Thanks for that taste

Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation, an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation and now my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win


I'll have you know that I've become


Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent tend to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war


Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now, for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
A declaration embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life


You will be shown how I've become

Why they all want to get rid of me?
Everybody's my enemy
Several try to disguise the devil in them
Wanting to get into my cerebellum
But I'm ready and willing to tell them

Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling

Do sick stuff on my porn collection on television

To pull the wack talent off the stage

Something about the way you move, it got me...
Hooked on you, no matter, what I do

Stack up, every penny, money over these broads
Back up, against the wall in a riot or brawl

And till I die, I'm a ride with my niggas through thick
And thin, playin' him, we playin' to win
Steady ballin', soarin', long dickin' these broads, and..

I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down


Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?


Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well

Daddy, please hear this song that I sing
In your heart there's a spark that just screams
For a lover to bring a child to your chest
That could lay as you sleep
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet


Blister please, with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine
How he'd love to find your tongue in his teeth
In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep
Wrapped in boxes so tight
Sounding only at night as you sleep


And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I'll love you
For the rest of your life when you're ready


Brother, see we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames
And you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth
Push the pieces in place
Make your smile sweet to see, don't you take this away
I'm still wanting my face on your cheek


And when we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
When we break we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life


Two headed boy, she is all you could need
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
And retire to sheets safe and clean
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave

Outrun  the law or spend my life in jail

When the days all seem to count for nothing
Is the hope that I hold onto now gonna count for something?
When the nights all feel like they're running together
That's when I keep on dreaming about things getting better forever
All the days that come and go
Across miles so far from home
All I find roads that ramble on and on and on


There's a life, there's a life that I'm missing
So much more than I can see
There's a life, there's a life that I'm chasing
That always stays one step ahead of me


Out of reach but I know that I'm getting closer
I believe that as long as I breathe that the dream's never over
Inside myself I try to find a way to keep this hope alive
I hold the line that keeps me hanging on and on and on

Here’s the misery that knows no end

To make sure I never love again

I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof

If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh

Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don’t know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?

A whole lot of prayin' on the backside of a stage, scared to death
Wondering what's next


And I take the long way around every time
As fast as I can through the comfort of night and it's a fight
The people who love me, they suffer the most
See me on TV and all they see's a ghost of someone they knew
They're tellin' the truth

Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

Leave a message in the dust just for me

The sky is fallin’, fallin' down

Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

I knew I could have, life is not a punch card, make the best of what you have


Don't wait, just go, and when you find yourself please let me know
It's not too late, just let go


Forget everything just for tonight
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
Cause I've been waiting for the night to say 
Let's believe that if we all stand together
We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once we're doing something right when we say, 


In the end it's not about what you have
In the end, it's all about where you want to go
And the roads you take to help you get there
I hope you think that's fair
Cause you've only got one life to lead
So don't take for granted those little things
Those little things are all that we have


Forget everything just for tonight
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
Cause I've been waiting for the night to say 
Let's believe that if we all stand together
We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once we're doing something right when we say, 


I said whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Everything, everything

Cause I've been waiting for the night to say
Whoa, Whoa

I remember we were on the bleachers sharing secrets when we look up, it'd be ""Where did the time go?""
And I remember you would hold my hand and call me baby while we dancing in the parking lot so slow


Bittersweet, those memories
When I see, you with her now


And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart to see you happy, without me


Oh I remember we would stay up late after the game look at the stars up in the sky in the nighttime
And I remember when you used to call me in the morning just to see if I was good and I slept right


Bittersweet,  those memories 
When I see,  you with her now


And it breaks my heart, yeah it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart to see you happy


Yeah, I remember when we would cut class
Go to the park, just sit in the grass
Send me the spark 'cause I light up the gas
Telling you that I'm ahead anyway
I wish the feelings would just go away
I still be thinkin' 'bout you to this day
Sometimes I call you from private and just remain silent 'cause I do not know what to say 
I know you stuck with the pain 
I feel so f-- ashamed 
Girl let's be honest I told you, I promise that I wouldn't do it again 
I know you stuck in your ways 
So much just push me away 
Now that I got a new flame
Glad that we're feeling the same yeah


But the sun will come again 
Maybe one day in the future 
You'll come runnin' right back again

Maybe one day in the future

,
But I feel a little bit dumb, just a little bit sprung
Just a little too late
Oh you call up those other chicks
I can't stop thinking it's lame missing you anyway


And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart to see you happy, without me
 And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart to see you happy, without me
I feel a little bit dumb, just a little bit sprung, just a little too late
Now you call up those other chicks
I can't help thinking it's lame missing you anyway

Yo, Red Spyda  is that 50 Cent/Pac joint ready?
 Let me know, holla 


There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future


Yeah nigga! Haha
Let's go nigga, this is what it is
2Pac cut his head bald
Then you wanna cut yo' head bald 
2Pac wear a bandanna
You wan' wear a bandanna

2Pac put a cross on his back
You wanna put crosses on yo' back
Nigga you ain't 2Pac - This 2Pac!


Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained
Military mind of a thug lord, sittin' in the cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, everybody's listenin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight


'Till Makaveli returns, it's ""All Eyez On Me""

And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be
You should've listened, I told you not to fuck with me

Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see



Now since you're crying for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nothin' left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not  - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
God made men the same boy, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playing with guns
While your momma had your punk-ass playing tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly-hearted, you couldn't make it on your own
Fuck The Source, I'm on cover of Rolling Stone

Old mister fun is back
Wonder where he's been hiding at
Hanging round the edge
Walls unfortified, inside

No different, patchwork hack
Toil away on an unlaid track
Falls closing in, got nowhere to hide
This time


Finding ceilings low
I'm too big or this room's too small
Why's my ceiling another's floor


Past twisted, expected warp
Attention span increasingly short
Hard to breathe, this altitude will get you high
I've tried


Finding ceilings low
I'm too big or this room's too small
Why's my ceiling another's floor


And nobody can tell you
It's a moment in time
That defines and deforms you

Now I just sit on the ground in your way


Now if it's time for recompense for what's done
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun
And the clouds will roll by
And we'll never deny

Please show me your second game
Please tell me your second name

"I never really had a problem because of leaving
But everything reminds me of her this evening
So if I seem a little out of it, sorry
But why should I lie? Everything reminds me of her

The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette
Of the sun on the steeple
And I gotta hear the same sermon
All the time now from you people:

'Why are you staring into outer space, crying?
Just because you came across it, and lost it...'
Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her...

Resist the temptation
This song go out to the Underground Railroad..
Digital Underground..


Resist the temptation of the beast
You slip and loose your grip, and forever fall asleep
The venom is contagious, be wary of its spell
What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell
I wonder if she knows, the devil's taking off her clothes
Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control
Poppa's doing worse, a victim of his deadly curse
Wouldn't be the first, to leave the ghetto in a hearse
Oh and how it hurts, the children pay the biggest price
Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life
Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
Someone from the top, supplying us with plenty crack
Keep 'em in a daze, don't let them see the other way
Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day
See, they never got a breath of the sunshine
Now the kid's addicted and only hit it one time
We're destined to be dead as a nation
Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation


From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation


Gamble for your soul with the devil
You wonder how low, can you go, before you finally reach the lowest level
As everybody sit and stares
There's no use looking in your eyes cause there isn't anybody there
And though it may make you wanna cry
Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why
I guess you think they'll understand
You feel cold, cause you sold your soul to the dopeman
Oh now there's no turning back, in fact
It's decided, that would live and die for the crack
You got no friends cause you cheated 'em all
Feel lonely, low, defeated and small
No one was there when I took the wrong path
And nobody'd care if I died in a blood bath
But is this my destiny?
Tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me
Cause I'm ready to end it all
One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all
I didn't mean to be a bother
A failure as a son, a husband and a father
I wish I could turn back the time
Go back and find, why I let it crack my mind
And my only explanation, it came to this
Resist the temptation


From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation


Your death left family behind
Your wife and your son find a gun, and pieces of daddy's mind
On the door and on the floor
Now her husband is dead, what else is she living for?
So now she picks up the gun
Now son is the only one
Grows up in adoption homes
Gets older, bolder, and cold cause he's left alone
To him, nothing is funny
Mind set on one thing, making his money
Since I was left with no hope
I want money and gold ropes and so I slang dope
Now I'm the neighborhood dopeman
And as long cause they smoking I'll never be broke man
I live the life of a trifle
Following a cycle, so I'm just a psycho
But if I had a better life
I would have lived a good life and did more things right
Hard to resist temptation
With all the aggravation and the frustration
Of living in the ghetto
Your mind gets twisted, just like a pretzel
So it's time that I check out
But one nosy cop, just won't let me get out
They got me trapped once again
With a choice: shoot the cop, or live life in the pen
I can't stand the frustration
Resist the temptation


From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation

Keep pressing, he's guessin'
Please, I'm in the cut wit a bottle she's blessin'
Where I been that's the key question, niggas yellin' keep reppin'
I must to left some kind of deep impression, peep the essence
I speak in lessons if you seekin' reference
Never leave your weapon, see me if you need connections we insessin'
Built aggression only brief deception
I mean my niggas filled with flexions
So believe he's resting, leave the message
Fuck with me niggas will beat you breathless, leave you naked
I keep it gully like the Visa question we perfect this
That's probabtion got us extra hatin'
No explaintion for the murders this just rap-a-lations recreations
This rap shit got us celebritin'
Like we saving, we in hell with Satan, jails are waitin' smell probabtion
Serve time got us telemaking
Legendary now niggas can't tell me nathin'

Yo, at fourthteen my hot ass was chasin' bitches
At fifteen my brother told me get them digits
Told me every penny count nigga hit them trenches
Don't floss to hard, don't burn no riches
Don't trust no bitch when your dough get heavy
And don't smoke with her if the blunt rolled already
No ass bettin', if you show it you betta blast it
Math class on the corner yeah I passed it
Die right now take twenty from you bastards
Fuck it throw a fifth of Henny in my casket
Never got my ass kicked, never had a pitbull
I just went to high school with the clip full
First nigga act get a clip full
Mama raised me but the streets made me
Rum got me hazy chasin' this cream
Fuck a dollar and a dream hundred grams and a thorough team
And I'mma make the block work
Sos re-ing me up got the hood on clockwork
Bedstuy nigga, you know it's on
Gotta flow so strong you could put it in a bomb


When I die I'm gone go in fashion, guns blastin'
Cash inside coffins, Memories get lost when you die
The legacy, an eye for an eye but overall I will survive nigga

Jump out the drop top
Catch you why you coppin' at that weed spot
Speak not you know them bitches be your weak spot
I'm in the trenches that's where ya'll niggas scared to come at
Where all the guns at, where my shorty flip them ones at
That's where my son's at, you speak of war but you don't want that
I blew the Timbs out and got the GS wit the rims out
I air your Benz out baby moms and her friend's out
I knock the lens out, I bring the Boyz and them Mens out
I leave you laced up, you paralyzed from the waist up
I'll fuck your face up, when I finish tossin' cakes up
I'm eating the Kris up, I iced the finger, neck and wrist up
If it's a mix up, look at all the ones that I fix up
I mean I fucked up, fuck around you getting stuck up
You press ya luck up, back this motherfucking truck up
I'm bout to black out, it's up to me to close this track out
I pull the Mack out, I blow your chest and your back out
And knock the Glock out, air this whole fuckin' block out
I knock a cop out, fuck a high school drop out
Attempt murders, two to sixty on a cop out
I'm fuckin' with my nigga's up north on a lockout
The M A S A, you run your mouth we smack the tast out
We blow your face out, pay the judge to throw the case out

Check the game and the cats that play in it
Quiet money youngest lieutenant
Yea world it's been a minute, I'm in it
Till my heart stop or blood touch the concrete
Beyond deep, these streets got me gripping my heat
Losing sleep, breaking day sling crack to fiends
W.D. forty to sixty having backwards dreams
The cash the cream, from the cradle to the casket green
Got the game tied up we the nastiest team
We flash we steam if its on then we mash your beam
Yellow tape the sidewalk and leave a nasty scene
Your back is spling ya brain, face and chest get sprayed
The desert the miss the spot when it bust your way
We touch we lay in the streets it's a must we play
We cook, we chop bust pots down and clust the way
From light to day its only right that we cock and spray
We speedin' off, could spot a snake from a block away
I told you A what the game need is a change of speed
Visulize the realism I'm a dangerous speed

"In a minute everything you have can all be straight gone
In a minute things you thought were tied can come straight undone
How about some knocks on wood some so far it’s so good
Any day what you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out
To the north and south that’s what plates are about
Nature has no conscience no kindness or ill will

The dreams they had make me sad because of the vibes of them
When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened
To me and my family my bro’s and I were driving
The RV bleeding flames us leaping through fire surviving
Zoned with no home there was fire all on it
Umm let me have my life I want it

I’m gonna let you know that I said
We’re coming in kill we’re coming chill
We’ve comin in how we will
Gone to tell the whole world what’s the deal
And I say know no critical boarder cuz
We do what we want
Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font

Not one to get over sounding like the norm
Friendly to the radio all that shit is corn
All we coming with is a little bit of swing
And we go on like it ain’t no thing

Omaha stylee did not think there was one
Where you know the radios weak and the shows are more fun
But you know we fuck up the dancehall since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state
Still we’re down like that
Still we’re down like that
Still we’re down like that
Makin the funk that smells of skunk


Such occasions occur back in the day
It begins you’re a raw kid all the way
Son of a gun but they you drifted
All are endowed but few are gifted
At the break of dawn behaving like a spy
Lampin in the light the cold world awakens
Deeper is the light to open up the sky

Look into my eyes see the dialatin’
Omaha Stylee is the shit we come with man
Embedded in our souls it breathes out from this band
We always knew that we could
Thank you if you too felt we would

Not one to get over sounding like the norm
Friendly to the radio all that shit is corn
All we coming with is a little bit of swing
And we go on like it ain’t no thing

Omaha stylee did not think there was one
Where you know the radios weak and the shows are more fun
But you know we fuck up the dancehall since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state
Still we’re down like that
Still we’re down like that
Still we’re down like that
Makin the funk that smells of skunk

We will arise explore these worlds and find the grass roots
How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew
My dude on the one come off like Teflon
Rock your shit and you will rise on

If you’re a farmer outstanding in your field say
Do as you will do as you wish follow your bliss say
We travel round the world giving it our best
Like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest

The hammer and the chisel and the rule it compass
We forged the sword chariots of war our battle axe
There’s much power in anger but loves a bigger banger
Complete props to my crew this is what we do

Step by step
We trudge on
On this scarlet road
Adrift and immured
Keen and uncured
Grimly walking the will of the one


One foot in front of the other one
On this steep road paved with our blood
Step by step we march a long walk
And breath by breath we just plough on


And I long to wake
Come up for air


But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand


One truth after the other one
Given and served we swallow down
Day by day we drink the blood of our sons
So they will walk this road again


But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand

Never could ever find the words to tell you, babe
How I felt so deep inside
Didn't want to be too bold, didn't want to hate on your girl but now I
Can let you know that it's wrong what you're going through
You deserve the same love I see in you
Given back a hundred fold, baby, I would do
Show you love that you've never seen, never knew


So hard to believe she left you alone all alone
I know babe you can come with me, though
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone all alone
I know babe you can come with me, though
I know you're alone you can come with me, though
I know you feel pain you can come with me, though
I know you feel hurt you can come with me, though
It wouldn't be the same if you come with me, though


It won't be the same
If you come with me
If you come with me, if you come with me, if you come with me
You won't feel no pain
If you come with me
If you come with me, if you come with me, if you come with me


So hard to believe she left you alone all alone
I know babe you can come with me, though
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone all alone
I know babe you can come with me, though
I know you're alone you can come with me, though

I grew up just west of the tracks
Holding me to hold me back
Around your door she's calling out my name
I come in at 5 AM
And she is waiting for me
She said, ""Where have you been?"", I said, ""I was out!""
She said, ""You're no good cause you're running without love""


And I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell 
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh and I'm gonna burn it down, baby


The black widow and the ladies man
Met down at the laundromat
And tried to make me understand
And just then, her mother bursts in
And said, ""You're the son of that bitch in the wind
Get out of my house and hit the road""
And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones' song


'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell 
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell


The stars came out and warned me so
As I walked on down the road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase steered me clear
She took my hand as we walked into the sun
A new day's promise had just begun
We'll make it alone whether you like it or not
And I turned around and shouted ""Help me momma!""


'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh yeah, I'm going straight to hell
Ooh just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell

"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That mean's he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but

When I open my eyes, I wish to see you
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew
Isn't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue
You sit in your room and you listen to tunes
And I'm feeling embarrassed, it's true
You out there in Paris with who?

Who don't know the life of a soldier, I'm older now
The world's a lot colder now

Passion, Pain and Desire just like my big bro'
What you didn't know it's this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low, he's invincible
So much soul that he redefined inevitable
So it'll never go
So the sun never set at all instead of setting slow
And as the legend goes Syre lived forever on
And never and forever alone, Syre

Saying that we'll run away
I doubt that we'll ever go

I have never been a hero
I have always been a zero
Baby, you should be the hero

Poets say he ascended to the Gods
Skeptics say he pretended to be gone
But I say that he's eternally lost

Did you see that man in the limousine?
With the pretty girl, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill


Did you see that man with a fat cigar?
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer


'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle


In the middle, in the middle, in the middle...


But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend


'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle

Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be

With insatiable hunger the godsent avengers
They feed on the volatile and evanescent
Raving across the face of the Earth
Cheering the gods in untamed frenzy

Feel the bite of the flames, cathartic firestorm
The seas of flames dance in ecstasy
See the billows smother cleansing away
Pruning of all filth


Voracious blaze
Engulf and erase
In one colossal feast

O deep blue flood
Roar your symphonia
Until there's nothing left


Like a relentless wolverine the ravenous unleashed
The blood-red swarm is devouring
Inferno divine
Revelling in sanctity


Voracious blaze
Engulf and erase
In one colossal feast

O deep blue flood
Roar your symphonia
Until there's nothing left


Mine is the fury
In my hands is justice
I bring atonement
And herald a new dawn
I ring the knell
I bring to life
I am the healing
I am the erasing


I am the beginning
I am the end
The end


With insatiable hunger the godsent avengers
They feed on the volatile and evanescent
Raving across the face of the Earth
Cheering the gods in untamed frenzy

Feel the weight of the waves, the cleansing storm surge
The invincible shall pacify
The wheel shall turn as it is foretold
Exult and rejoice


Voracious blaze
Engulf and erase
In one colossal feast

O deep blue flood
Roar your symphonia
Until there's nothing left

And all the colours bled away
And that was that

You're half out of your wits
And though your wristwatch always works
Your necktie never fits
Now it's so hard to pick the receiver up
And when I call, I never noticed you could be so small
The answer was under your nose
But the question never arose

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me

When the head and heart of it finally elope

With you back against the wall, be somebody to hate

You gotta push through it all if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers

"Io che ho pianto per te
Pregandoti
Di stare con me
Mi pento, perché
Non ti voglio più
Non ti amo
Non ti credo e perciò
Stai lontana da me
Non ti voglio perché
Non mi voglio così
E le strade sono piene di donne
Uguali a te...
E io che vivevo per te
Scordandomi
Chi pianse per me
Mi pento, perché
Non ti voglio più
Non ti amo
Non ti credo e perciò
S'è ormai chiusa per me
Questa storia perché
Io ritorno da chi
Già sapeva che sarebbe finita
Certo così...
Non ti voglio mai più
Non ti credo
E perciò stai lontana da me
Non cercarmi perchè
Io ritorno da chi
Già sapeva che sarebbe finita

"My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name 'til the fever broke
When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black
That the darkness hums

I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind be good to me
An awful noise filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere

A woman's voice
I quickly ran
Into the trees
With empty hands

A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no words, no sound he made

His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone to end his pain
What caused the wound
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes were watching me

The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life I didn't have
Dear, in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers
Of joining you

I clutched my life and wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet
How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something
In the woods somewhere

"You thought that it could never happen
To all the people that you became
Your body lost in legend, the beast so very tame
But here, right here
Between the birthmark and the stain
Between the ocean and your open vein
Between the snowman and the rain
Once again, once again
Love calls you by your name

The women in your scrapbook
Whom you still praise and blame
You say they chained you to your fingernails
And you climb the halls of fame
Oh but here, right here
Between the peanuts and the cage
Between the darkness and the stage
Between the hour and the age
Once again, once again
Love calls you by your name

Shouldering your loneliness
Like a gun that you will not learn to aim
You stumble into this movie house
Then you climb, you climb into the frame
Yes and here, right here
Between the moonlight and the lane
Between the tunnel and the train
Between the victim and his stain
Once again, once again
Love calls you by your name

I leave the lady meditating
On the very love which I, I do not wish to claim
I journey down the hundred steps
But the street is still the very same
And here, right here
Between the dancer and his cane
Between the sailboat and the drain
Between the newsreel and your tiny pane
Once again, once again
Love calls you by your name

Where are you Judy? Where are you Anne?
Where are the paths your heroes came?
Wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away
Was I, was I only limping, was I really lame?
Oh here, come over here
Between the windmill and the grain
Between the sundial and the chain
Between the traitor and her pain
Once again, once again

I wonder where you went
Losing light to early nights
'Cause summer’s gone again

A broken promise in disguise
The stars have got their fingers crossed
I’m underneath the same old sky

'Cause you're always on the hunt, looking for serenity
Some of the times are gonna be rough
But no matter what it brings
Just lean into it, yeah, lean into it

I was thinking bout the way that we began
I started out just to be your friend
As time went on my feelings began to grow
Because you blessed me with your touch and your embrace
Now when I think of all you've done for me
Baby your love it rains down
All over my world and
When I think of all the things you've done for me
Your love rains down
All over my land

Chorus:
You promised me your love
I promised you my time
We can take this love to heaven
If you just put your hand in mine
Girl my life never began
Until you showed me how to trust
At times I was afraid
But still you showed me
True love
True love, baby

Verse 2: 
I promise I, I promise I won't change
Babe I'm gonna be, I gotta be the same man you met
But that won't work unless you're here with me baby
Cause you complete, you complete the man I am

I'm the man I am today because of you
I am not the man I used to be
Was blind, but now these eyes can see
This love will keep us strong throughout the years

A pilgrim on a pilgrimage
Walked across the Brooklyn Bridge
His sneakers torn
In the hour when the homeless move their cardboard blankets
And the new day is born
Folded in his backpack pocket
The questions that he copied from his heart
Who am I in this lonely world?
And where will I make my bed tonight
When twilight turns to dark?


Questions for the angels
Who believes in angels?
Fools do
Fools and pilgrims all over the world


If you shop for love in a bargain store
And you don't get what you bargain for
Can you get your money back?
If an empty train in a railway station
Calls you to its destination
Can you choose another track?
Will I wake up from these violent dreams
With my hair as white as the morning moon?


Questions for the angels
Who believes in angels?
I do
Fools and pilgrims all over the world


Downtown Brooklyn
The pilgrim is passing a billboard
That catches his eye
It's Jay-Z
He's got a kid on each knee
He's wearing clothes that he wants us to try


If every human on the planet
And all the buildings on it
Should disappear
Would a zebra grazing in the African savanna
Care enough to shed one zebra tear?

Real verse illiterate, I'm still on that tequila shit

Ventriloquist, hand in some clitoris
Would never float on foreign land I'm unfamiliar with
Did the dealerships, every year, iller whip
Dream from that killer shit, remain as a lyricist

In retail since Pete and C.L. did Reminisce
Peace to Jena Six, Emmett, Bell, my nigga Nick

Love me a witty chick, that's pretty, don't penny pinch
Warm kitty could do the Diddy on the liqourice

So deprived I could cry when I mention this

Wake up in the morning, roll a blunt and then I count bank
Pull out the garage, hit a button then the top faint
You ain't from the ""A"", all you really did was migrate
Asking me if I'm great, yeah bitch I'm great
Swerving down Peachtree, yeah bitch I'm straight
Every day my birthday, yeah bitch I get cake
You better get dough, ho you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a love letter
Came up off Ball and G, growed up off Bun and C
Got me a Chevy swapped feet twice the same week
Shawty say she want me, shawty know I run things
We used to wear the mask like Friday the 1-3
Then I found out I had that pimp in my bloodstream
Got me one ho and then I got me a whole team
Had a starting five with a bench on the side
So for every bitch I got, she got a bitch on the side

 x2
Pimp all day I even pimp in my sleep
When I wake up I smoke a blunt before I eat
Ho don't violate, bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a little letter



I got money on my mind, I got cash up on my brain
I got green up in my eyes and I ain't finna pass it mane
Never let a penny pass, never let a dollar disappear
And if you don't understand me bitch I'll make it crystal clear
Coming down the Gulfway, passing by the Scale Co
Candy on the car, nigga pop my trunk they have no
Choice but to watch the neon lights with my name lit
Pimp a ho, stack the dough, yeah I'm on that same shit
Lames sit your ass up in the stands and eat a hot dog
This is for the big bosses boy and you are not hog
Never been a eagle man, I never seen you soar
Through the sky, looking super fly cause you paid off a whore
You're not a pimp, put that on Pimp, you a fraud
Buying pussy on the side instead of tryna break a broad
We don't do that over here, matter fact we never did
So keep your distance from the circle, we ain't with that tricking shit
Bitch




Your eyes wide open, scopin', ropin' hold that thoroughbred
Pussy wet like April shower, twerking power, thorough head
Get deep in the mind of a pro, take her where she never been but where she wanna go
Unless she in the comfort of a monster with a mouthpiece, then I reach her on stroll
Pimp shit get rich and quick, tell a bad bitch how I feel
Never laid back, gotta make a quota, if it ain't a high roller keep that pussy sealed
So motherfucker can you buy that? At the rhythm of a bass drum
Hit the club buy the bar like a star take that other nigga bitch like dare that nigga say something
I seen pimps and you ain't one, you're not close to me I'm everything a real nigga supposed to be
You act like you did everything you could, but she was supposed to leave
At her neck like rosaries if she ain't where she supposed to be, I put her on game
She devoted to the notion of roller coastin', and that won't change
With my trunk on bang, sun on shine, break a bitch down like a Garcia y Vega
Fill her up with the gumption to hit the ground running, and go and get me some gators
Yeah suits with the tailor, that fit the frame of a nigga all about his paper
Forever pimping, never slipping, forever recruiting these top notch hoes in the majors

Is how the boy don't always get the girl

But that wasn't enough

When times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through

Late nights feeling sick you my remedy
I remember every moment every memory
Sipping on you fuck sipping on the Hennessy
Have you living in the hills, out in Beverly
Yeah we coulda been forever been a legacy
But you tryna fight  claiming that we enemies
Thinking 'bout the jealousy forgetting all the chemistry


Whatever happened to together till we 70
We moved apart girl  now we living separately
I remember you, can’t you remember me
Loving you my speciality , you my secret recipe
You helped me find my self a part of my identity
My love my oxygen to me you a necessity
I hope this reaches you if not its my serenity
Bars on my mind like I’m convicted for a felony
And ahh that was a hard time
Its been a while since we talked its been a long time
I been on my phone, checking if you online
Stalking up your page, wonder if you’re on mine
Been a couple years, thought that I'd be over you
Still hold the tears, when I think of holding you
You left and disappeared, I can’t get a hold of you
I can’t believe you’d me wrong
Was someone else controlling you?
'Cause after all the times, everything we been thru
Every time you lie , I’d always defend you
When I saw you cry, id just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple
So tell me did you love me? Or did you pretend to?
Every time you touched me, was it even special ?
Was I priority ? Or squeezed into schedule
Baby you angel same time you the devil
After all the times, everything we been thru
Every time you lie , I always defend you
When I saw you cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple

Eyesight is a gateway
To a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet
On a airplane yelling, “Mayday”
With a good girl gone bad girl
Who went gay ’cause of date rape
That's a metaphor for the US
'Cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized
Put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised
For the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it
With my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! 
This for Trayvon and Tree
Burn the bush and chronic, speakin' honestly
We livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies
Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States
Talkin' about “let's make a fort”
Talkin’ about “let’s make it great”
If the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot

Find a way to get on and get up and get out the crib
I was just looking into the mirror
Tryna dislocate my fear 'cause you broke my heart
Let me dry my tears
So serious, I'm so neglected
In the wrong direction with a long erection
Got no protection but it's fuck the world
When she bend it over, being over-sensitive
But did I mention that my real intentions
Are on me really dealin' with the consequences
And I see your tone is very condescending
When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it
And I pity the fool
Been tryna vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
Just stop brushing me off to the side 
Oh say, can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
By the dawn's early light, double Sprite and a R.I.P. tee
So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blaow in the night time
Of the slum house, little drum bump with the one thousand
Come-come, here they come

When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
Baby, there's a time to stand your ground

Take you down to Hell
They don't give a damn for any kind of life


Phantoms bring evil, destruction and death
Night after night, the same old game
They all look so harmless
But deep in their hearts
Satan is lurking and he will break out

Always someone at your back
Only waiting to attack

Phantoms of death
Phantoms of death


The empire of deceivers is built upon your fear
You have to leave it, cause the end is near
Warheads, armies stand to strike
I know it isn't right
I wanna get out of here
I don't wanna die

Infernal destruction and fire you'll burn
Then you'll be helpless
But it's not too late
Stand up right now and you'll be the winner
Or Satan will get you, take you forever

Genocide everywhere
Where's the saviour of this world?

Phantoms of death
Phantoms of death


Where is he, the promised saviour?
The one who'll save the earth
Perhaps he'll come to bury us
But then it'll be too late
Who are they?
Who are the phantoms who will end our life?
It's you and me, you and me
Open up your eyes


Phantoms bring evil, destruction and death
Night after night, the same old game
They all look so harmless
But deep in their hearts
Satan is lurking and he will break out

We are all parasites of this world
We shall die

I'm torn apart and you know

Cold case love

"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings

And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung

And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me

""Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink""

""There,"" calls the mariner, ""There comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?""

See... onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

Death and she life in death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
Then... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... she, life in death
She lets him live, her chosen one

""One after one by the star dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men

With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one.""

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on

And then we pin the tail on Tuesday
Watch those strings go up and down
The elephant in the room begins to dance
The cameras zoom into

Those hateful words he uses

Divided into reasons why

The residue from the price tag
On the tip of my tongue
The words don't come they go
How many likes I gotta get
Before I know the truth
And the truth is
Season three will be a great reason
To forget all about reality's
A slippery slope
Watch the TV scream and shout it

Deserve anything

And the good guys always win

"When Leonard finally came to California
He was twenty-one years old as I recall
He loved to write a song and pick the guitar
And he came to hang a gold one on his wall

The town in which he lived is not important
But you'll know which town I mean by the time I'm through
He soon became a famous entertainer
But Leonard was a name he never used

He was on his way to having what he wanted
Most of all his dreams had been 
Hey, once he even followed Elvis Presley
And he wrote a lot of country songs for me

But he laid it all aside to follow Jesus
For years he chose to let his music go
But preaching wasn't really meant for Leonard
But how in the hell was Leonard suposed to know

Well, life began to twist its way around him
And I wondered how he carried such a load
He came back again to try his luck in music
And he lost his wife and family on the road

After that he seemed to bog down even deeper
And I saw what booze and pills could really do
And I wondered if I'd ever see him sober
But I forgot about a friend that Leonard knew

Well, Leonard gave me lots of inspiration
He helped teach Hag how to write a country song
And he even brought around a bag of groceries
Hey, back before Muskogee came along

Really I'm not trying to hide his showname
Or the town in which this episode began
Just had to carry on a song for old Tommy
If just to see the smilling faces of the band

When Leonard finally came to California
He was twenty-one years old as I recall
He loved to write a song and pick the guitar

Through the lost mountains endless
So far away from home

Crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high
Forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight
On towards our destiny we travel far and wide
Journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die
In the flames of hell we fire at will, the fires of doom has come
With the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
Far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
When the time has come for battle now we follow with the horde

We will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
In the land of long ago forever in our souls
Fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
In ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again

Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home

We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home

Fallen soldiers taste the steel of death, the daylight dawning
Sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
As you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
You feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
There's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day

In the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left, no place to go

Still searching for the answers, for the right to understand

Back to the days when she drove me crazy


I said ooh
I may be drunk, but what I thunk is
How she touch me means I'm lucky
She wants the D
She wants the D from me
And I said ooh
With all that junk up in her trunk
It still got room for me to stuff it
She wants the D
She wants the D from me

How could you let your girl get off your arm
Knowin' she's so fine

I was born in a beauty salon
My father was a dresser of hair
My mother was a girl you could call on
When you called she was always there

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on
It will only drive you insane
You can't shake it or break it with your Motown
You can't melt it down in the rain

You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain


I've looked behind all of these faces
That smile you down to your knees
And the lips that say, Come on, taste us
And when you try to they make you say Please

When you try to they make you say Please
When you try to they make you say Please

You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain


Here comes your bride with her veil on
Approach her, you wretch, if you dare
Approach her, you ape with your tail on
Once you have her she'll always be there

Once you have her she'll always be there
Once you have her she'll always be there
Once you have her she'll always be there
Once you have her she'll always be there


Ah but don't go home with your hard-on
It will only drive you insane
You can't shake it or break it with your Motown
You can't melt it down in the rain

You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain


So I work in that same beauty salon
I'm chained to the old masquerade
The lipstick, the shadow, and the silicone
I follow my father's trade

Yes I follow my father's trade
I follow my father's trade

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on

Moving like everyones watching

Goodbye for a lifetime

Cause everything you are disgusts me

I miss the days when I had a smile on my face and
Wasn't so caught up in all of the small things
Wasn't so adamant that I could handle everything alone
And wasn't so cautious and always exhausted
And actually listened to things that my heart said, heart said
Ridin' my bike, just ridin' my bike
Not overthinkin' my life
Not always wonderin' if I'm a likable person
Or someone that nobody likes
Not always stressed about money or losin' my job
Or scared I ain't makin' a flight
Not always goin' to bed every night
With this knot in my stomach that never unwinds
What happened to me? Yeah, what happened to me?
When did I start to believe I wasn't worth it
Then question my purpose to breathe?
Wonderin' who I should be
Happiness out of my reach
Scared to get back on my feet
Need to get rid of what's detrimental, but it's hard to let go
When the thing that hurts you help you get to your dreams
See, I miss the days when I wasn't so faded
Love wasn't always invasive, I could embrace it
Just innocent, waitin', not always livin' in anguish
When did I break and become overtaken?
What was the moment I caved and
Gave away all of my faith and made a replacement?
I miss the days when, I miss the days when—


I miss the smiles we had when we were young 
I miss the memories of feeling love 
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun 
Staring out the window when the rain would come 
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah 
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah 
When we had joy and we were innocent 
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again


Give me my mind back, yeah
Give me my mind back
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I fall flat
Yeah, fall flat
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I'm off track
Back when my imagination wasn't in a cage and it was free to run fast
Yeah, give me my mind back
Yeah, give me my, give me my mind back
Before it was hijacked and wasn't described as
A place of limitation, always indicating I can't
Handle everything from my past
Handed anything it dissects 'til I'm depressed
I know I'm blessed, but I'm cursed too
Take me back when I was happy, but I wasn't actin'
Vulnerable but didn't see it like some kind of weakness
Or a thing that's unattractive
Had emotion, but I learned to mask it
Didn't know what I was runnin' after
Didn't know the older I would grow
The more I'd lose control and take in all the baggage
It's really sad when everything you thought was stable crashes
Everything you thought would take the sadness
Really only made it deeper, got me off the deep end askin'
Will we ever feel like we imagine?
Will we ever feel like we adapted?
Will we ever feel like we did back then?
Just take me back when, just take me back when

They have the same fears
Shed similar tears
Die in so many years

In every continent - coast to coast
Now our lives are in the hands of The Pusherman
We break it all down
In hopes that you might understand how to protect yourself
Don't make no profit for The Man

How The Man take your money
He's shrewd as he can be
In such a way you'll never see
It's a terrible thing inside
When your natural high has died
The weaker turn to dope
And put all aside their hope


And I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me


Twinkling twinkling grains
They do all sorts of things
While your inner mind is pleased
Your conscience is only teased...


More and more you feed
Until you grow another need
Playing fantasy
You have no reality


I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high

I'm so glad I've got my own

Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson


And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip


Landing on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage 
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge




Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping

I know you too well
Sounds like you're on your way
The highway's on your voice
Three exit signs away
You know how I think
I'll play it tough and cool
Try and shut you out
Like I always do


Then you knock, and you'll come in
If you come in, you'll sit down
If you sit down, I'll pour us a drink
And if we drink, then you'll be laughing if we laugh
We'll get closer, if we get close
We'll lose our clothes, and then we'll
Fall back in love for a while
We always go in cycles
On and on in cycles


We can't be together, sure can't be apart
Every last goodbye, is just another start
You gone and grab your things
And walk out the door
Say the hurt is over, and that we're done for sure


Then you knock, and you'll come in
If you come in, you'll sit down
If you sit down, I'll pour us a drink
And if we drink, then you'll be laughing if we laugh
We'll get closer, if we get close
We'll lose our clothes, and then we'll
Fall back in love for a while
We always go in cycles
On and on in cycles


We're made for each other
Till we ain't made for each other


But then you knock, and you'll come in
If you come in, you'll sit down
If you sit down, I'll pour us a drink
And if we drink, then you'll be laughing if we laugh
We'll get closer, if we get close
We'll lose our clothes, and then we'll
Fall back in love for a while
We always go in cycles
On and on in cycles

"I got a question mark
You got a need to always take some shot in the dark
I don't have to make pretend the picture I'm in is totally clear
You think that all things have a way they ought to appear
Cause you know you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know
You know I don't
I dream
Don't know what you mean

Panic called you out and took you in
Giving you an easy game and letting you win
Giving back a little hatred now to the world
'Cause it treated you bad
'Cause you couldn't keep the great unknown from making you mad
'Cause you know you know you know you know
You know you know you know you know
You know I don't
I dream
Don't know what you mean

Said your final word, but honesty and love could have kept us together
One day you'll see it's worth it after all
If you ever want to say you're sorry you can give me a call

Watching the ships roll in

Watching the tides roll away

Headed for the 'Frisco bay

Everything remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes


Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone

Just to make this dock my home

Yeah, for those that's locked in Comstock
My peoples sittin' in San Quentin and Clinton
Rikers Island, Rikers Island, Cracker's Island


I wake up to them rappin' tunes every afternoon
I be home soon, I see the board some time after June
Met a couple of convicts that's way beyond sick
It seem they dig my style 'cause I be on some Don shit
Laid back, I ran into some brothers from way back
Those I dug we hugged, besides that, black, I don't say jack
I stay in tune with the sun, stars and moon
'Cause behind bars you're doomed if your mind can't consume
Plus, spiritual pain can bring forth physical reign
And without knowledge of self, how else can a criminal change?
And being locked up just ain't the life for me
Shit is way too trife for me
""You're comin home soon"" sounds so nice to me
Plus, you can bet I'm bouncin' out with mad props
And if I get chopped or not, baby pop
My world don't stop





And in here it makes all end up the same from blowin' backs out
5 to 15, seein' the bean until they max out
Misbehavin', actin' uncivilized like cavemen
I witnessed brave men that gave in
Sodomized and turned to gay men
Nobody's playin drama, prisoners be posted preyin'
On some low shit layin', sleep, get your whole shit banged in
Hangin', plus who's to warn you
Out of the hell these inmates gone through
From three halves of a four group doubt if anyone is normal
And over all it's hard to call who would try to play you
My kid from my tomb's caught a carved spoon through his navel
Nothin' can save you, even C.O.'s'll try to grave you
It's painful to even know those who most faithful'll betray you
I lay low-key, cause I ain't Hercules
Tryin' to get out early on work release
Prayin' the system work with me
'Cause I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot
That ain't my plot, baby pop
My world don't stop





So until that day, I'm discharged and set free
Fuck who's gonna sex me
My mind's more based on makin' my next G
Now let's see, left alone me as a juvenile, no more movin' foul
The penile possessed me with a smoother style
Blessin' my mental with mathematics to map shit through graphics
Fuck it, I ain't with hustlin' backwards
A wiser man with ideas and liver plans
More mature and for sure done saw all my eyes can stand
Sittin', tryin' to design these words of mine
To define what occurs when you're servin' time
Stress just blurs the mind, behind bars, scars are signs of hard times
I'm trappin' myself in between these lines
But I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot
That ain't my plot, baby pop
My world don't stop





Yeah, representin'
For all the fellas on lock-diggedy

When the fists of winter fly
Driving bones into the snow
Blackened frostbitten nights
Vodka running dry

The statues cloaked in white
Migrants from museums
Losing all the feeling now that
Sunrise is outlawed

Strangers plant themselves
Down in the cold hard ground
Later when the harvest thaws
Snow drops will be in bloom

Crossed out on city maps
Prospekt Mira reveals
Shadows drinking antifreeze
Neath the underpass

Ordered once a gulag’s march
Now cities send the call
Falling from the rooftops fast
And frozen against the wall

Where strangers plant themselves
Dead souls of the underground
When February thaws
Snow drops will be in bloom again

Bloom again, bloom again
Bloom again, bloom again

I was listening to the sound of the waves breaking
And I thought of all the words that they were whispering
And it kept changing
I was standing in the midst of a great company
Listening to the voices in ecstasy
And I watched as all creation was sang into being
And it kept changing
And it was changing

And all at once I caught a pulse and felt a rhythm
And I thought of the song of the ages
Then the balance slipped and opened up the season
And I felt like raging

I was staring at the clouds, the rain began to fall softly
Filling up the rivers in Texas
And I thought of you and maybe you once thought of me
We were changing
And we kept changing

And all at once I saw a hole into the future
And I thought of the bells of creation
I heard the voice of God coming in the music
And I felt like Satan
And I felt like Satan

Listening the sound of the waves breaking
And I turned to you and said ""we should never leave""

As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
Two two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped


Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young


Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
You ain't shit without your homeboys


Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young


Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at 8D, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggas be together
Ain't shit without your homeboys


Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young

There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you tell to me alone
I can't reach things I can't see
You don't see this strange world quite the same as me
Don't deny me what I am
Nothing hidden, still you fail to see the truth
These are things you can't reveal
These are things you can't reveal


We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man?
Infernal sacrifice of Hell
Fire breathing, lead the way
Mounds of bodies, as they all burn into one
Revenge is living in the past
Time to look into a new millennium

Spiral path leads through the maze
Down into the fiery underworld below
Fire breathing, lead the way
Lucifer was just an Angel led astray


Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries


We are not worthy in your black and blazing eyes
We gather demons in the mirror every day
The bridge of darkness casts a shadow on us all
And all our sins, to you, we give, this day
Others wait their turn, their lives were meant to last
Use yours wisely, as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught, I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us


We are cast out by our bloody Father's hand
We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world, the only one we trust




Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none


Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth


Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now, grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding, corrosive subsiding
That withered and waned till the world seemed all drained fills the bay


Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none

Took a little breather of my own
I might be too far gone
Little fragments of my life
I'm slowly dying
Trying not to be so far from home
But will I be there alone
Fragile pieces of my mind
I'm feeling paralyzed
Compromise


So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight til I'm not breathing
Let it out, taking hold
Just let it all find a way to be
So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight til I'm not breathing
Let it out, taking hold
Just let it all find a way to be

Critical decisions took too long
My promises are strong
Watching loyalties divide
So I'm taking back my life
Golden visions from now on
Can't carry you alone
No more explanations why
I've erased the dramatized
Neutralize


So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight til I'm not breathing

With bushels of bad habits

Preached the devil in the belfry

The high road is, the life I live, the life I'll give
To my MSFTS if they were ever questioned
Stand back and watch the re-election
Little joker


Uh, me and Teo are still tweakin the hook a little bit
So here's the second verse


What is this?
Watching pigeons fly
Wearing some vintage clothes they got from the dentist
Don't ask me, I'm just a witness
Watching 24 fitness close
Put on some clothes before I can say a sentence
My dad complain about my wind-tints
Say that they gon pull me over on the verge in this
Man, you talking about the equinox
Well yeah we turnin this
Money, yeah we're earnin this
Oil, yeah we're burnin this
Kylie  lookin' at me saying ""Jaden, why you learning this?""
Hotter than some furnaces
Man, I'll never learn to fit

Man, I'll never learn to sit
Man, I'll never learn to quit

If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow

We put it in writing
But who you writing for
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle 'til this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity and this guitar case

Yes my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
And who you dying for
B - I would have died too
I'd have liked too
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war

Like the radiance from all the galaxies
In a single massive fire

Of delusional complexity
And I find every war 'cos I have to be
The savior from insanity

And into systems undefined

Bring our salvation
As we cross the speed of light and time
Gonna blast through like a satellite

And there's nothing left to magnify
Momentum

What you feel right now is your liberty
And the absence of the liars
Though the world was alight in a blaze of flames
You were always in denial
If fate was a game and a strategy
I would stake it all in destiny
I will reap what I sow I am set to be
Free to reject the jealousy

We crossed the line between the world of space and time
And into systems undefined

Bring our salvation
As we cross the speed of light and time
Gonna blast through like a satellite

Like the universe is unified
And there's nothing left to magnify

I see the chance of a lifetime for my creation
I override the unstoppable shutdown

We crossed the line between the world of space and time
And into systems undefined

As we cross the speed of light and time
Gonna blast through like a satellite

"L-O-V-E
Al Green
By W. Mitchell, A. Green, T. Hodges
From the album 'Al Green is Love'

I started to write this song about you
And then I decided that I would write it all about love
And it appeared to me
That you wasn't happy
And that's for sure, positively
That's what the world is made of

So give me more L-O-V-E, love
Love is a walk down Main street 
Love is an apple that is so sweet 
Love is something that can't be beat 
L-O-V-E is strange to me, Oh

I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
It's all in the heavens, can't you see
You can always depend on me

To give you love
Love is a flower in my soul 
Love is a story that just can't be told 
Can't you feel it burning more and more 
Stop and look at the big wheel roll

I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story
About love

I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story, I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together
And I can be such a happy fella

About love
Love is something that is so divine 
Love is a feeling that's a friend of mine 
It can't be measured by no sign 
In your heart or even in your mind
About love, Love is as bright as the morning sun

I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me


The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling


Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up




These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me


Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming, through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing

"I was walking in New York City and I brushed up against the man in front of me
I felt a cardboard placard on his back
And when we passed a streetlight, I could read it, it said:
""Please don't pass me by - I am blind, but you can see -
I've been blinded totally - Please don't pass me by.""
I was walking along 7th Avenue, when I came to 14th Street
I saw on the corner curious mutilations of the human form
It was a, a school for handicapped people
And there were cripples, and people in wheelchairs and crutches
And it was snowing, and I got this sense that the whole city was singing this:

Oh please, don't pass me by
Oh please, don't pass me by
For I am blind, but you, you can see
Yes, I've been blinded totally
Oh please, don't pass me by

And you know as I was walking I thought it was them who were singing it
I thought it was they who were singing it
I thought it was the other who was singing it
I thought it was someone else
But as I moved along I knew it was me, and that I was singing it to myself

It went:
Please don't pass me by
Oh please, don't pass me by, yeah
For I am blind, but you, you can see
Well, I've been blinded totally
Oh please, don't pass me by
Oh please, don't pass me by

Now I know that you're sitting there deep in your velvet seats and you're thinking:
""Uh, he's up there saying something that he thinks about, but I'll never have to sing that song.""
But I promise you friends, that you're gonna be singing this song: may not be tonight
May not be tomorrow, but one day you'll be on your knees
And I want you to know the words when the time comes
'Cause you gotta have to sing it to yourself, or to another, or to your brother
You gotta have to learn how to sing this song
It goes:

Please don't pass me by
Ah you don't have to sing this .. not for you
Please don't pass me by
For I am blind, but you, you can see
Yes, I've been blinded totally
Oh please, don't pass me by

Well, I sing this for the Jews and the Gypsies and the smoke that they made
And I sing this for the children of England, their faces so grave
And I sing this for a saviour with no one to save
Hey, won't you be naked for me?
Hey, won't you be naked for me?
It goes:

Please don't pass me by
Oh please, don't pass me by
For I am blind, oh but you can see
Yes, I've been blinded oh, totally
Oh now, please don't pass me by

Now there's nothing that I tell you that will help you connect
The blood tortured night with the day that comes next
But I want it to hurt you, I want it to end
Oh, won't you be naked for me?
Oh now:

Please don't pass me by
Oh please, don't pass me by
For I am blind, oh but you, you can see
Oh yes, I, I've been blinded oh, totally
Oh please, don't pass me by

Well I sing this song for you Blonde Beasts
I sing this song for you Venuses upon your shells on the foam of the sea
And I sing this for the freaks and the cripples, and the hunchback
And the burned, and the burning, and the maimed, and the broken, and the torn
And all of those that you talk about at the coffee tables, at the meetings
And the demonstrations, on the streets, in your music, in my songs
I mean the real ones that are burning, I mean the real ones that are burning
I say

Please, don't pass me by
Oh now, please don't pass me by
For I am blind, yeah, but you, you can see
Oh now, I've been blinded oh totally
Oh no, please don't pass me by

I know that you still think it's me
I know that you think that there's somebody else
I know that these words aren't yours
But I tell you friends one day

You're gonna get down on your knees
You're gonna get down on your knees
You're gonna get down on your knees
You're gonna get down on your knees
You're gonna get down on your knees
You're gonna get down on your knees
You're gonna get down on your knees
You're gonna get down on your knees
You're gonna get down ...

Oh please, don't pass me by
Oh please, don't pass me by
For I am blind, yeah but you, you can see
Yes, I've been blinded oh, totally
Oh please, don't pass me by

Well you know I have my song and I have my poem
I have my book and I have the army, and sometimes I have your applause
I make some money, but you know what my friends, I'm still out there on the corner
I'm with the freaks, I'm with the hunted, I'm with the maimed
Yes I'm with the torn, I'm with the down, I'm with the poor
Come on now ...
Oh...
Ah, please don't pass me by
Well I've got to go now friends
But, please don't pass me by
For I am blind, yeah but you, you can see
Oh, I, I've been blinded, I've been blinded totally
Oh now, please don't pass me by

Now I want to take away my dignity, yes take my dignity
My friends, take my dignity, take my form, take my style
Take my honour, take my courage, take my time, take my time, take my time
'Cause you know I'm with you singing this song
And I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would go home with someone else
Yeah, wish you'd go home with someone else. I wish you'd go home with someone else
Don't be the person that you came with
Oh, don't be the person that you came with
Oh, don't be the person that you came with
Ah, I'm not going to be. I can't stand him. I can't stand who I am
That's why I gotta get down on my knees
Because I can't make it by myself
I'm not by myself anymore, because the man I was before, he was a tyrant
He was a slave
He was in chains
He was broken
And then he sang:

Oh please, don't pass me by
Oh please, don't pass me by
For I am, yes I am blind, oh but you can see
Yes, I've been blinded totally
Oh please, don't pass me by

Well, I hope I see you out there on the corner
Yeah, I hope as I go by but I hear you whisper with the breeze
Because I'm going to leave you now, I'm gonna find me someone new
Find someone new

And please don't pass me by

When I cry
I'm always looking to tomorrow
As you mourn the days gone by
You always tread
On my toes
But my guiding hand of love
Is helping everywhere you go

You're always right
But I can see right through the lies
To the never changing light

Rain on me
My arms are cold

But there's water on the road
And if I do
You will not change

In an orbit that is strange

Get your arms inside my head
And stop me thinking for a while

Hung on a sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am a king

A king of everything and nothing
I'm on my way to heaven...

I'm always here

When there's nothing left between us

With a voice who wants to sing

A nigga gotta pay the fuckin rent


Crazy, I gotta work with what'chu gave me
You claimin I'm a criminal and you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this holocaust headin for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war
And got a busted jaw for sayin fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm mad check the record
What's a nigga gotta do to get respected?
Sometimes I think I'm gettin tested
And if I don't say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay testin
I keep a vest on my chest in case the cops are gettin restless
Walkin around, ready to light shit up
But since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust, huh
They make a nigga be a killer; I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see who's realer
Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me
And I wonder if the Lord ever heard of me, huh
I need loot, so I'm doin what I do
And don't say shit until you walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nuttin left to lose, so I'm singin nigga blues


Why'd you slang crack? I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin rent


Poppa need brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do?
My little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war, but I ain't old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, huh
And you're hooked on my ""I Don't Give a Fuck"" look
Make your rules, I'mma break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em, you show me bacon I'm take 'em
So don't you ever tempt me
I'm a fool for mine nigga and my pockets stay empty
To my brothers in the barrio
You're livin worse than the niggas in the ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police?
Don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We ain't free, I'll be damned if I play the trick
For a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, caucausian bitch
Down with my homeboy Rich, huh
Fuck a snitch and a groupie-ass bitch
And the nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home
So he can go out and bone, huh
And you wonder why we blazin niggas
Cause you punks havin babies can't raise the niggas
And they bound to be fuck-ups too
Drinkin forties of brew, huh, singin nigga blues

Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end
They looked at me and said, ""I heard that you're a heartbreaker""

Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker

I'm that type of guy you won't cuff
I'm that type of guy your daddy won't let you go out
Cause he thinks I sell drugs

I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time
Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
That I can do

Gotta keep my baby girl laced in the latest and the fliest suits
Never one for none, let's stay caked up, hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like I are the dude
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now




See I'm that type of guy that like kissing
I'm that type that will pop the clip and
I'm that type of guy that put you in your place
If your bougie just start tripping

I'm that type that will let you go
I'm that type that will let you know
That everywhere I go I can find a pretty ho
But there ain't too many know how to get that dough

That's the type of girl I want around me
Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free
Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
Look like something you would see on TV

She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words, it don't matter
But this time they wanna see us together
Look at us now




You're not for sure
Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go
Because of you, all the girls is staring, taking notes
And I realize being with you girls bring more girls
And that's just what I'm attracted to

And I'd rather go all the way
Love her long time, till the break of day
I won't let her ever leave my bed
Till she sees the color purple like Anna Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she's smoking on
I'll be long gone before you can say, ""Look at me now""

"Ma non ci siamo già forse visti
Scusa credevo... mi sembrava...
Però hai un modo così strano
Di ondeggiare quel tuo bel sedere...
Dove vai... con quell'andatura...
In mezzo ai guai... così sicura?
Con quello spacco che quando s'apre
Mi sento ridere tutto dentro
Mentre consumo le mie idee
Tra il reggicalze e le tue mutande
Dove vai... con quell'andatura...
In mezzo ai guai... così sicura?

Tu stai camminando come se nel mondo
Tutto andasse bene... mentre sta scoppiando
Una terza guerra che farà sparire
Quei due bei seni che tu porti in giro

Perché ogni albero che buttan giù
Sarà segnato con il sangue tuo
E dai tuoi turgidi capezzoli sgorgheranno le città infette
Infette dalle bustarelle comunali
Come quella dei promessi sposi
E allora lasciati un po' andar...
Finché siamo ancora in tempo

Si così... i love you
Sento nelle vene
Scorrere come un fiume
La tua primavera

Che mi trasporta dove splende l'arte del rinascimento
Mentre vedo avanzar sulle acque del lago di Lecco
Un uomo con una vanga
Che comincia a scavare
E a seppellire
Tutti quanti i mangioni
Dell'anonima edilizia...
Che in nome del profitto
Hanno maciullato l'Italia
E raso al suolo Milano
E quel ramo di Lecco
Riducendolo come un colabrodo
Da Palermo a Como
E li vedo sprofondar...
Sprofondar giù nel buio
E l'uomo sai chi è?
Un certo Alexander
Che Manzoni fu
Quando si respirava

E la sua vendetta...
Nasce dai tuoi baci
Dal tuo candore...
Da questa tua sana sensualità
Che riscalda il sangue
E rinnova
Ciò che sta morendo

And you know we had some laughs, couple giggles hearty har

Then sometimes fall back in all over again

All you have to do is give me that smirk
And the whole days trouble melts away
And a firey passion stirs itself in me
You pull me back when I'm standing on a brink
Oh girl you make me stop and think

But I got to think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play 'cause I play them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you the door


Well, I gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!


Baby I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please, don't go away
'Cause you're giving me the blues
Baby, your mind made all the word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy blues
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you that door


Well, I gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Get the fuck up!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!
I gotta have faith!
Faith!
Faith!

The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do

And foolish though it may seem, to me that's everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near you

I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love

Nigga, this is not a fictional tale, this shit real
We was sittin' in the Bookings? Charged, direct sale
Third shootout… we was fightin’ for positions
Shell casings out my 9 flyin’ through your mama kitchen
Paper we stack it, pistols we pack it
You fuck around, we’ll blow your heart out the back of your jacket
Bitch, get down or lay down, my work is at Chach' crib
‘Cause he got big, now he lieutenant so he sit there and watch
I swear to God I think I had the same vision that Cat had
Woke up sayin’ “we gon’ turn them corners to Baghdad”
Yeah, we was young, but we had guns, we started juxing niggas
All you hear is Boo-Boo fuckin’ with them Brooklyn niggas
I had supreme schemes, Corley Wall thoughts
Start shootin’, I bet I’ll clear off the ball court
I want it all, that’s just how I fuckin’ feel, boy
Get in the way, you gon' take your trip to Gilmores


I’m dreamin’ of…
My dream of freedom…
Financial freedom


Consist of big bags of bread and some coke, nigga
You can get with the program, fam’ll get smoked, nigga
We was a school of sharks - a bunch of young soldiers
Open your head when you’re half dead – you see? I told you
On the island, got that burner, got the flamethrower
A couple niggas got blown, I got my name known
Over the phones, soon as I’m home, the game’s sewn
I got connections – look, bitch, I’m connected
And I ain’t givin’ niggas no passes, so respect it
Or get dealt with, I’ll break you off proper
You ready to die, huh? Too much Big Poppa
Easy – nigga chill or get laid out
I’ll put a hole in you then find out what your gang ‘bout
I do my dirt, I’m hardly ever by my lonely
I got that tech with that cooling system on me
You think you want it, you don't want it with me homie




We stackin’ paper ‘til we strong then we takin’ over
Grab a gat, bring the crack back with baking soda
Bridge the gap, get slapped, actin’ like you know us
North Pole, nah, Southside produce the colas
We’re the last of our litter, this is what they taught us
We’ve got to kill what we eat, that nigga came up on us
If you ain’t gamblin’, get the fuck out the spot, boy
Shoot an ace off your foot, that’s some shit you should get shot for
Fuck it, when I win I’m a winner – when I lose, I’m a winner
‘Cause to my niggas y’all niggas lookin’ like steak dinner
You screw your face the fuck up, you gon' do what?
The strap big enough in my truck to chew your crew up
Nigga stand down or get manned down
Mack, two clips, 30 rounds plus 30 rounds, flip it around
You gon’ fuck around and get jammed up, blammed up
Hit your spine, a standup nigga can’t even stand up

But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes
It rises above me so bright and so blue

For your love has found me and it feels so right

Around the scars they swell
In flame with a sedative

"-Tearz Of A Clown -


""Start from the intro""
I can't though, it's gonna be too painful
To speak of all the evil obstacles my people came through
""Equality?""
Is not true, I rush to beat the curfew
I guess nobody told us that the people gotta eat too
""The system?""
I laugh, cause I don't see no truth left
Addicted to that crack or raised too high to fight for Yusef
Can't blame 'em, they slumber, come here ya Casanova
Just because Mandela is free don't mean the freedom fight is over
The beaches, Howard, Virginia and the others
Ya let 'em lynch the brothers and no one will love the mothers
""Confused?""
You shouldn't be, my facts are stated clearly
But my raps contain no ""wild thing"" so I guess no one will hear me
""They're killin' us?""
But what's new, cause nobody will yell out
They're all too busy livin' lavish lives of a sellout
""The police?""
A big joke, the only time their gun smokes
Is when they murder brothers after every bone has been broke
""Huey?""
A hero, although he never tried to be
Died and since his death he's still a victim of society
""Well, what's next?""
Unity, respect and love your sisters
We joke and call 'em bitches so the crackers try to diss her
""We'll kill them?""
That's not the way, it's time to use intelligence
""Turn the other cheek?""
Never again, it's time for self-defense
""How come you're so angry?""
Cause I'm tired of bein' kept down
Now it's time to wipe away the tears of a clown




""Why ya cryin'?""
I told ya, I'm tired of livin' life low
The rich can beat the lotto, while the poor stay in the ghetto
""The president?""
Elected, but I don't know how it happened
Better qualified for rappin', with his gift for senseless yakkin'
A day for Martin Luther King, now his soul is put to rest
Turnin' over in the grave next to him is Malcolm X
Forgotten too quickly, it makes me want to hate them
Forgot about his wisdom, he's the latest fashion statement
""Red or Blue, what set ya claim?""
Does it make a difference?
One day we're gonna work it out and overcome this ignorance
""Education?""
Propaganda, taught to me in class
How can we control our future if we're kept from our past?
We better live a better way or we won't see another day
You can heed the words I say or don't and kiss your life away
Not tryin' to preach or teach, it is my wish to only explain
So many died before me, can I let their lives be in vain?
So now we've come to this point, it's time to make decision
Do we live in self-destruction or escape the realism?
They ask me why I'm angry, cause I'm tired of bein' kept down
My people, let's unite and wipe away the tears of a clown




""What ills the children""
The future, for them, I see such sorrow
The least that we can do is let them live to see tomorrow
Too many have been killed, it's time to stand up for our rights
How can the people ""Fight The Power"", if they can't fight for their life?
Instead, they fight their wife, beat up if she's not silent
Time to fight for principles, the brothers get nonviolent
The government is so crooked and liberties a hypocrite
""The Star Spangled Banner?""
Just some patriotic bullshit
Destruction of the Panthers another sneak attack plan
Couldn't stand to see the strength and peace within the Blackman
""Where are all the heroes who we thought were so untouchable?""
I see 'em pushin' dope and rollin' 'round in BMW
How can it not trouble you to see a dyin' species?
The world must find peace or find itself ripped up in pieces
Afflicted with the teaching's, that make ya feel inferior
Some say the government invents it all, that they just scarier
Polly want a cracker, but cracker want a sister
How come they could see her beauty, but brothers persist to diss her?
Revolutionary generation on an uprise
Never will they see another tear from this clown's eye




Livin' the life I live, I have to be positive
Hell's my reality, I chose not to ride in it
I did want to live fast, I just wanted much cash
But punks were persistent, they hunted with gauge blast
So I wasn't the violent type, I had to protect my life
Lovin' my brother, but if he steps, I'mma shoot him twice



Psychotic society
It's hard to find love with those who treat us like enemy
They call me a lunatic, I say realistic
Beware of their politics, it's sick as the sick get
The son of a Panther, see pain in my mama's eyes
Cause nobody thanked her for givin' them better lives
""Assata Shakur?""
Another auntie, I miss her though
Please thank Mr. Castro for keepin' her safe bro
How many more of us die before we can see the light
It's time brothers work it out, unite for a bigger fight
We're still in the same hole and now it's the 90's
Seems everyone's livin' large, but I ain't got mine G
But I got a bill for all the ill ya gave me
Society slavery, who's gonna pay me?
""Has anybody here seen Yusef Hawkins?""
I thought I seen him talkin' with Malcolm walkin'
""Where, over the rainbow""?
Naw, over the track
Another murdered brother, now where's the payback

"You can't mix Angels and Alcohol
I don't think God meant for them to get along
When it takes control you can't love no one at all
You can't mix Angels and Alcohol

You can't blend whiskey with a good women's love
They don't go together, loves already hard enough
You think you can handle how it feels or what it does
You can't blend whiskey with a good women's love

You can't chase lonely with a bottle of wine
It might ease the heartache for one short piece of time
In the end you have to face what's hiding in your mind
You can't chase lonely with a bottle of wine

You can't mix Angels and Alcohol
An angel once loved me and I traded it all
I let the bottle drive my life into a wall
You can't mix Angels and Alcohol

Where'd you go? You were there by my side
Keep believing it's my turn to hide
In a place where we don't have a prayer

Take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent
Stay where you are
Ever, after
Chasing things that we should run from


Will we ever get away from this place?
It's an image that's burned on my chest
For a moment you need me to stay
Cold-blooded and drifting away


Trade our places
Take no chances

I'm not hard as a rock, I'm just not easy to break
But don't take it as an open invitation to try
Cause I'm just hopin' this time that it's all in my mind
I won't find that there's anything to worry 'bout


I want you to be yourself, I love it when I see you having fun
I don't wanna be your shadow, sadness taken away the sun
And you can call me a fool, but I just wanna see my baby smile
I don't wanna kill the mood, I don't care if I'm in denial


It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show

But don't turn me into someone who'll break down and cry

None more than I can take
Oh none more than I can take
Kindness is what you showed to me
It holds me 'til I ache
Overflow, and start to break

Oh, I'm kind of hoping this will turn me round

Is what you showed to me
It caught me by surprise in this town of glass and ice
Kindness, so many people passed me by
But you warmed me to my core, and you left me wanting more


Oh I got a feeling this'll shake me down
Oh I'm kind of hoping this'll turn me round
Oh I got a feeling that however small
Oh I'm kind of hoping this will reach my soul

Verse 1: 
You know I like it when you get low
Bouncing up and down like it's a rodeo
Hotter than them chicks in the videos
From your pretty head to your pretty toes

I know you like it when I hold tight
Every little touch feeling so right
Baby I can spend the whole night
Dancing here with you under the low lights

Pre-Chorus:
Something bout you makes me wanna lose control
I can feel it in my body and my soul
Girl the way that you're dancing, and moving it on me
Got me hooked can't let you go
Feel the rhythm feel the flow

Chorus:
Right to left, left to right
I can watch ya shake it all night
Face is tight and your body's just right
Put it on you tonight I just might
Left to right, right to left
Babygirl you look so hot to def
Break it down but you don't break a sweat
I can keep up, make you lose your breath

Verse 2: 
You know I like it when you whine slow
Dancing like you're giving me a private show
Glowing under red lights but I'ma go
Cause your giving me the green light so I'ma roll

I know ya like it when ya feel me
Pressing up against you, you're a lil freak
In about an hour girl I will be
Giving you my love on top of silk sheets

Looking for a peace at the end of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself, fever's high
I'm all at sea and so unwise
I'm so afraid I'll lose your love, as time goes by
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright
The sunset built a memory, our love sign
And all at sea we come alive
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home
A place called home
And take me to a place called home
Home
I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I design
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all at sea we say goodbye
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home

If it ain't about money nigga, you ain't sayin' nothin'


Pull up to the club 'bout a 100
It's a lotta Pirus and a couple bounty hunters
I'm whippin' in that Wraith with my gunners
105 west with some shooters right in front of us
Got that meth lab up and runnin'
Rest in peace to the big homie buntry
Rest in peace to young thug, lil homie
From Centerville to Fruit Town, we gettin' money


You don't bang bang, you ain't gang gang
You ain't never slang, choppin' 'caine
With a bad bitch from Spain
Talkin' slang off the promethazine
OHB, bitch, new whip
Stashed with rubber grips
Stackin' chips
Some of my homies Bloods and some bangin' Crips
22 rims with my brims and some lady friends
Stackin' ends, niggas in my way, that's one to the chin
Pockets on swole, I got a bunch of bands on me
All these model bitches, they can't keep they hands off me


Oh you see the new gang comin', new gang comin'
Got that new gang comin'

Bitch it's OHB, yeah we comin'


Pull up, pull up if you 'bout it nigga
Where I'm from, we body niggas

On 12 o'clock, you ain't ridin' with us
I got killers that do what I say when I need
Bullets spray, follow the leader
I got homies pullin' up in broad day
And set this bitch off like Keef
Smokin' Khalifa
And you was the one sayin' you ready for war
Now you on the ship, you sound like a bitch
Can't fuck with you boy
This that new gang
All my niggas wear new chains
And I put my bitch in a Mulsanne
OHB in a black Lamb' like Bruce Wayne

Pardon me but I don't usually talk a lot
If you ain't talkin' money, nigga what you talkin' 'bout?
The drop head take up multiple parkin' spots
Nowadays gotta keep most shooters in Harvey got
All about my presidents, hustle, never hesitant
Fuck who you invested in cause me, my niggas next to win
Money be my closest kin, I consider it my fam
Keep the drummer like a bam and bein' broke, I never can
Money's all I understand, I speak that shit fluently
Every way, you never there, we call that shit truancy
You speakin' that foolery, this money's nothin' new to me
Ain't worried 'bout who's hot, I was cool before it was cool to be
Fuckin' with a triant god, welcome to the tribe mob
Plus we out here ballin', bang it down like the LeBron lob
Championship rings for me and my fellow squad

"Why would he come
Back through the park
You thought that you saw him
But no you did not
It's not him who'd come across
The sea to surprise you
Not him who would know
Where in London to find you

With sadness so real
That it populates
The city and leaves
You homeless again
Steam from the cup
And snow on the path
The seasons have changed
From the present to past

The past
The past
Turns whole to half
The past

Why would he come
Back through the park
You thought that you saw him
But no you did not
Who can be sure
Of anything through
The distance that keeps you
From knowing the truth

Why would you think
Your boy could become
The man who could make you
Sure he was the one

The one
My one

Up through the doorway as the sideboards creak
With them ever proclaiming me

"What a Friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit
O what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness:
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Are we weary and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our Refuge-
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He'll take and shield thee
Thou wilt find a solace there

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, ""I love you,""
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true

It's nothin' personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry

I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm takin' my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favourite girl

It's hard to say it though
I close my eyes, knowin' it'll be alright 
But even if they understand
They can't hold my hand, no

The feelings, they make it hurt
Don't wanna listen to someone like this
Well, then I need a better world

Convinced that I am gonna be a writer and a movie star
I've a picture of dad here sitting, hair down to the ground

We've played games of fate and chance
We were caught and made to dance
Sold our souls to slavery
Lost our way and prayed for death

The first thing I remember
I was lying in my bed
I couldn't of been no more
Than one or two

I remember there's a radio
Coming from the room next door
And my mother laughed
The way some ladies do

When it's late in the evening
And the music's seeping through


The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah

And down along the avenue
Some guys were shooting pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella groups, yeah

Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah


Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke
Myself a ""J""

And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began
To play

And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away


The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do

Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way that I loved you

And it was late in the evening
And all the music seeping through

Killing us one by one
In one way or another
America will find a way to eliminate the problem, one by one
The problem is the troublesome Black youth of the ghettos
And, one by one, we are being wiped off the face of this Earth
At an extremly alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact that we are not fighting back
Brothers, sisters, niggas
When I say ""nigga"" it is not the nigga we have grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But, to me
It means ""Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished"", nigga
Niggas, what are we going to do?
Walk blind into a line or fight?
Fight and die if we must
Die, like niggas


This is for the masses, the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're superior
Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that that refuses to respect us
Emancipation Proclamation? Please!
Lincoln just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy
The constitution, yo, it don't apply to me
And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me
This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin'
But its wrong to keep someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching children
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty


This is definitely uh... words of wisdom
AMERICA! AMERICA! AMERIK-K-KA
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence?


Words of Wisdom
Based upon the strength of a nation
Conquer the enemy armed with education
Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do
Know thyself, teach by what we've been through
Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that?
’Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime
But forget it, cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable
They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe
’Cause it will strangle ya
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
You swear to your mother that you living in equality
Forgetting your brother that's living here in poverty
Thought they had us beaten when they took out King
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
The battle ain't over 'till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom


NIGHTMARE! That's what I am
America's Nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and the evil that you gave me
I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people
For four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
Ha, but you can not escape fate
For it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you will fall
By my hands
America, you reap what you sow

Everybody screamed
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was


Taken by surprise 
When I kissed the teacher 
Couldn't quite believe his eyes 
When I kissed the teacher 
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher


One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright


I was in a trance 
When I kissed the teacher 
Suddenly I took the chance 
When I kissed the teacher 
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher


One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright


What a crazy day 
When I kissed the teacher 
All my sense had flown away 
When I kissed the teacher 
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher


 When I kissed the teacher
 When I kissed the teacher

The dam broke in her blue eyes
When that goodbye
Slipped off of my tongue

""In no time, you'll be moving on""

But looking through the plate glass
Of this bar

Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me shakin' my head, good god man
I must have been blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
Boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
No signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight

So I could do things
Anything that I want
Thought I was gonna fly high
Turns out I couldn't be more wrong

This heart full of regret
Forever left behind
With this picture in my head


Of her up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me wishing that I was that mic stand
Man, I was so blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
The boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
And no signs of her putting them brakes on

When I waver on the attuning
I kill a magical child

When vitality is far gone
When the spark is out, uninspiring

I had a dream last night
I was floating down that black water
Kick back on the Mississippi
On a raft with ol' Tom Sawyer
He got restless down around Memphis
That's where he left me
Said, I'm one rambling man
I was gone before you met me


And there I was back in my hometown
That's just how dreams go
Thumb in the air, wanted out of there
Had my eye on the road
Well I hitched a ride with this beatnik guy
Said, looks like you read me
My name is Jack Kerouac
I was gone before you met me


You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
Your fix that roof, put your roots in the ground-boys
Pink house, the white fence
Pretty little woman, two point five kids
Dang right, it's a good life
But boys like me are born to run the wild side
Like the restless wind you'll never catch me
I was gone before you met me


And just before I awoke
I had a bad nightmare
I was on some lost highway and you were nowhere near
Someone took your hand I wasn't that man
Girl, it sure did hit me
I was cussing fate but it was too late
You were gone before you met me
Yeah, I smelled that coffee
I heard you singing in the kitchen
Walking in got a kiss, you said the sink’s still dripping
Thank God I'm still driven


You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
You fix that sink, put your roots in the ground-boys
Blue house, the white fence
Sweet little woman, rocking that goodness
Dang right, it's a fine life
This restless heart found a heart I can call mine
I was smart enough to let love catch me


So Tom and Jack just ramble on without me
'Cause I was gone before you met me
Gone gone, gone before you met me
Gone before you met me

'Cause all we have is here
If your eyes are open
If your heart's not frozen
Don't let it all disappear
'Cause all we have is here


Essential dedication to the pace of life
Open your eyes, how will we survive?
Survive
Deep in your heart, you know the truth


So scream it loud, loud
Scream the truth
If they don't listen, scream it loud, loud
Scream the fucking truth


If your eyes are open
If your heart's not frozen
Don't let it all disappear
'Cause all we have is here
If your eyes are open
If your heart's not frozen
Don't let it all disappear
'Cause all we have is here


Downtown is on fire
The final hour approaches you
Caught in the headlights, guilty of murder
Deep in your heart, you know the truth

"Non si gioca coi sentimenti
Non ho giocato mai...
Ma se dai retta a quel che senti
Quanti guai

Io non volevo ferir nessuno
Eppur l'ho fatto sai
Chissà cosa darei...
Ma è troppo tardi ormai

Ciò che è riamasto, quel che c'è
Io l'ho già dato a te
E ho ricevuto, lo sai anche tu
Molto di più

Tu sei arrivata quando io
Non ti aspettavo ormai
Sei la mia vita tu...
Tutte le donne tu...

Ancora vivo
Sì, ancora vivo
Esagerato dentro e invece fuori schivo
Emozionato, innamorato
Ma con un fondo opaco un poco addolorato

Mi piove dentro
Il tetto è aperto
Il mio passato chissà com'è non ha il coperchio
Ma io ti amo
Tu non sei sola, la tua presenza adesso quanto mi consola...

L'entusiasmo che avevo quan'ero bambino
Ogni tanto ritorna e mi esplode nel cuore
Specialmente se a volte mi vieni vicino
E mi sento arrivare ondate d'amore

Ancora vivo
Sì, ancora vivo
Esagerato dentro e invece fuori schivo
Emozionato, innamorato
Ma con un fondo opaco un poco addolorato

Non si gioca coi sentimenti
Non ho giocato mai...
Ma se dai retta a quel che senti
Quanti guai

Io non volevo ferir nessuno

Chasing my goals cause you know I'm a dreamer
Friends turned up on me, you know I believed ya
Out in the jungle, they hunt like hyenas
Thought you said, you said you loved me


Indie Jones, part two, don't ever call it a sequel though
Unexpected, baby, you respect it, baby
Or you gon' get all your speakers blown
Wanna say hi to the haters now 
Oh I got love for me haters now 
Y'all gon' make all of us famous nows
I pull up, they all wanna wait around
I rap like I got a chip on my shoulder
But the truth is I probably got a few
Seen too many friends switch up
Round the time I finally got a view
I finally got a clue
This rap thing is really similar to
The worst parts of being in high school
Tryna figure out what I got myself into
Everybody gotta fit, that's a part of the process
Never been around so many men that gotta gossip
Now I'm seeing everything and all of my options
Why would I dumb it down if I had already lost them
Huh? You ain't never had no answers for me
What? You must wanna be a crash course dummy
I ain't never seen a people live so reckless
Don't oppressors get the message?
They gon' have to form a task force for me
I'm a problem so, never been kinda dope
Yea, I'ma talk my, talk my 
For whoever want that smoke


Chasing my goals cause you know I'm a dreamer
Friends turned up on me, you know I believed ya
Out in the jungle, they hunt like hyenas
Thought you said, you said you loved me


Play pretend, they play pretend
This is family, ain't no friends
Ain't no ends, ain't no ends
Tell 'em, you don't want no smoke
I'm on ten


I be feeling like, I been working like
Twice as hard to get half as far
All these rappers aren't really real
What you're really seeing is their avatars
'Bout facts first, never pack words
They be criss-cross, sitting applesauce
I'm a young vet, make the sunset
But never gon' threat to these amateurs
Ryan Vetter be a beast now
He got me on them beats now
I refused to stop getting paid
But you could get worked in a freestyle
Shout out to Sicily though
This is my Italy flow
They gon' keep actin like Chief
They don't want beef
But I got that Hickory smoke
Who the Lamb of God
I'm a fan of God
Yes he woke me up, I was comatose
I don't wanna be so self-absorbed
Detox 'fore I overdose
So it don't really matter what I be feeling
God could really do it if I be willing
God could really do it and he revealing
Whenever I'm broke, he stay rebuilding


Chasing my goals cause you know I'm a dreamer
Friend's turned up on me, you know I believed ya
Out in the jungle, they hunt like hyenas
Thought you said, you said you loved me


Play pretend, they play pretend
This is family, ain't no friends
Ain't no ends, ain't no ends

Chasing my goals cause you know I'm a dreamer
Friend's turned up on me, you know I believed ya
Out in the jungle, they hunt like hyenas

Roll with my girl like we Martin and Gina
Treat every show like a sold-out arena
I only need the ones who love me

You proably heard Ma$e tried to join the team
Cause Puffy's too busy selling pimple cream
What Puff sell next is Maybelline
Or dance next to Joc to try to get hot
This is the quiet before the storm, the warning before it's on
50 back on that shit, 50 finger to flip


They don't do it like this, concentrate on the wrists
I got see-through rocks on a Chronoswiss
I got rich real quick, now I'm sipping on Cris'

On the back the clip, thats the hammer on the pound
So you better 
I'm on the Greyhound and now I'm on the run
Cause I ain't doing time for no damn murder one

These hoes get down when I show 'em my wood
Niggas get down cause they knowing they should
And when them thangs spit rounds they flow through the hood
If you's a hard nigga you feeling you gotta prove it
I run with the Unit, please man don't do it
Act tough now, you have to duck down
You hit the lotto last week, you out of luck now, nigga


I get money, money I got
The strawberry deck could be the same color the drop
You can see a nigga clear when I put down the top
Sunlight hit the watch, you see the shit down the block

Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty old truck

And another one in the dresser drawer
Just in case the one in the closet
Didn't make a big enough hole

She had his breakfast ready every morning
And his lunch in a box sitting out by the kitchen door
She'd make sure he had everything he needed
And hug his neck and tell him how much she loved him
And it was beautiful
You should have seen it

Then she'd make herself a pot of coffee
Just the way she liked it
And sit down and enjoy the quiet of the house all alone
About two o'clock or so every afternoon
The quiet would start getting to her and she'd watch
The clock until he came back home

And she understood just what he needed
When he came home every evening
Was a couple of beers and a couple of minutes
To cuss about his day
So she'd fix him a nice hot supper
While he ranted and raved about one thing or the other
And she never once told him what he was going on about
Didn't add up to a thing

And she never touched that gun in the closet
It was his, and it was there just because he wanted it to be
She didn't get out much, so she never knew what it was
That made him so afraid

Most women today would say she was a disgrace
Most men would say she wasn't much to look at
And they'd all say she'd be a lot better off
If she cared a little more about what they all think
She could have a life of her own if she had a little pride
Some silicone implants, and another man on the side

But she's got a loaded gun in the closet
And it's there anytime she wants it
And her one and only man knows it and

First it was me and my pistol, but since the last mistrial
Spin up a Cristal, I'm living it up
My lawyer, K.O.'d the case, checked the lawbook for my name
I sit in courtrooms and throw signs like I'm a Mason
Money is power, envy is cash, breed evil
I could be robbed with the jewels I drop
Came into the store a year ago
I decided to stack chips on the whip
Push the hoot, now I be sitting on Beach Huevo
Contemplating coping the Coupe... Hmm, should﻿ I?
Ghetto as I wanna be, I say ""What up dude?""
When I breach you serve you bricks, through time to beat you
Send you back if you headed to your people
Threw out my chest when I make power moves like I'm right on the L




You wanna, party with me, come on, party with me
Oh, you don't wanna party with me, it's aight with me
Shorty, what's your favorite champagne, Cristal, Moet or Dom P?
Lighten up, get a bottle boo, but it ain't on me
I'm caught up, in my ghetto way of thinking
From the ice, to the minks, to the champagne we drinking
Big boys is playing Benzos with AMG kits and 20 inch Lorenzos
Follow me, round and round, the club
3 and a quarter drop-tops with hard tops
20 whips for chip; that's it. Average joes who flip bricks
My team flash keys like they grow on trees
When it's hot, park the whips and ride bikes
If you  through traffic on the turn-bikes, aight

""No thank you"" is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come


One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And ""no thank you"" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong


But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?

You're hard to hug, tough to talk to
And I never fall asleep when you're in my bed
All you give me is a heartbeat
I've turned into a statue
And it makes me feel depressed
'Cause the only time you open up is when we get undressed


You don't love me, big fucking deal
I'll never tell you how I feel
You don't love me, not a big deal
I'll never tell you how I feel


It almost feels like a joke to play out a part
When you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
You know I'd rather walk alone than play a supporting role
If I can't get the starring role


Sometimes I ignore you, so I feel in control
'Cause really, I adore you and I can't leave you alone
Fed up with the fantasies that cover what is wrong
Come on, baby, let's just get drunk, forget we don't get on


You're like my dad, you'd get on well
I send my best regards from Hell


It almost feels like a joke to play out a part
When you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
You know I'd rather walk alone than play a supporting role
If I can't get the starring role


I never sang for love, I never had a heart to mend
Because before the start began, I always saw the end
Yeah, I wait for you to open up, to give yourself to me
But nothing's ever gonna give, I'll never set you free
Yeah I'll never set you free


It almost feels like a joke to play out a part
When you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
You know I'd rather walk alone than play a supporting role

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you


Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming


Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you


Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it


Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you


Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing


Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you


And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow


Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me

You still sit here on your fleeting throne
So busy with your own little feuds
And your own blinker crowns

And we are free at least by now
So take the fucking plunge

Arise
United we'll stand

Impetuous furor
The bite of our blades
Let them see our freedom's ensign
Let us raise our clenched fists in pride

What benefit will it be
To save your crowns but forfeit your freedom at last?
We are one folk and we can make a stand
So lay down your crowns now
Rise and unite

'Cause I hate to spend
My life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time! 
How it start? How it start?


Started off with, runnin' from coppers
Duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life, if the judge don't like us
Am I clear as pictures? I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF, state feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us? Was it bitter or sweet?
See if a, nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat
On these streets livin' do or die, circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for G's
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped, with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time; stranded in the county in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls...
Lost souls, nigga, for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul


Just wait until rain turn to sunshine

Roll wit' it, nigga; roll wit' it, nigga


My brother Sean, first on my list, he came home
Went back in and came back home again
And he just violated parole
Now Uncle Sam wants the time he owed
Back to the system, Black and trapped in a prison
I miss him, it's just my brother don't listen to nobody
He hardheaded, stuck in his ways
Won't change for nobody, all I could do is pray for him
And I'm praying for myself
Trying to beat the odds with the cards that we was dealt
Young niggas need help, the suicide rate is up higher than ever
Rest in peace to granny, send my love to KRS and the family
We need to try to make it through the struggle as family
They say rapping don't pay them bills
Trappin' gon' pay them bills 'cause this ain't how we tryna live


Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
One time, one time, one time


I've been waiting on the rain to turn to sunshine for a long time
Stuck up on this grind, still want mine
Lost a couple homies, miss some comrades
But ain't no looking back when you gotta keep it crackin'
Just had another birthday, guess I'm lucky
Triple 7's, momma's still here to hug me
My baby on the way, she need a whole lot
She gon' get what she need, that's on pops
I used to love the shit, but man, the shit changed
It's a shame, niggas paid to be lame
But, uh, some of the realest, some people give it up
Lost souls around the world looking for love
I'm forever thuggin' on them hoes, right or wrong
Thug life embedded in me 'til I'm dead and gone
It's in my heart, in my flesh, in my soul
I used to be lost but now I know


Just wait until rain turn to sunshine

The universe we mold around this one of a multi-dimensional speckles of reality resonates
Or you can say it creates, an interference pattern within the fabric of space
If we were to look closely at an individual human being
We would find that the body is made up of a massive resonalting particles and is in itself a universe
All information exists here and now within are own consiousness
There are places we can go within our consciousness that unite our being with the cosmos
We need to align our minds with the cosmic mind
If we are going to find any of the purposes of our existance
Or to find answeres to some of the unexplained problems
Especially as we are heading towards one of the most important increments in the history of our time here

Just lay back and cruise


Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In the race for the cheese I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas could tell
The East coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists write about me leave me confused
Have me feelin' like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic, shit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move

Had yo favorite actress, from yo favorite shows
In my favorite position, you know how it goes
And my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit, this is When Doves Cry
This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly
Homie this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen, your fuckin' brain's on drugs
Look ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on a TEC
Fool trippin' threw a set, you can get yo ass wet

Stupid, chase the paper they come with the shit
I'm fallin', in love with success
Entrepreneur, connoisseur, I maneuver the best
Rollin', Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunner have your homies burnin', rest in peace candles
As wise men speak I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my nigga the world turns

Per la citta
L'impronta di un passo traccia la via
Dove lei sta
La vedo gia
Che dietro ai vetri suoi
In sottoveste sara
Lei mi aspettera

E giochera
Con il suo alito
Sui vetri freddi finche
Lei non mi vedra

La bacio, l'abbraccio e la stanchezza
Subito va
Mi sento di ghiaccio, lei cosi calda
Mi sciogliera

Ahh when you cross that line that you know you can't erase
To fall in lust, not love, ain't no sin at all
And tell me when your with your best friend's friend, do you still feel out of place?
No thanks, I took that ride
God only knows I tried believing


I imagine everyone sometimes
Would cross their heart and hope to die to tell ""I love you"" lies
I imagine everyone survives
For giving up all that you got to tell ""I love you"" lies


First time you look for love, you find you don't know jack
Yeah, so much for mind games you play to win
'Cause first you lose your heart's desire, then you get it back
But ignorance ain't bliss
There's so much more behind the kiss I'm feeling


I imagine everyone sometimes
Would cross their heart and hope to die to tell ""I love you"" lies
I imagine everyone survives
For giving up all that you got to tell ""I love you"" lies


When loneliness and paranoia feeds me
God help the person who needs me




If ignorance is bliss, then take me off the list, I'm leaving

A new day, another morning after
Leanin' back on my chair in a greasy spoon cafeteria
Last night was some beer-lairy-ness done our way
But again, we're back in the light of day
Chattin' shit, sittin' at the wall table, telling jokes
Playin' with the salt, looking out the window
Girl brings two plates of full English over
With plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomato
Get my phone out, 'bout to give this girl a shout
See if she had a nice time last night uptown
Ask if she fancies tryin' it again some time
Then Cal grabs the phone like ""Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!""


Hold it down, boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself


Seriously Mick, you fucker
No, no, no! I mean, I'll fuckin', I'm no way, d'you know what I mean?
I mean I'll fuckin'... I can take it or leave it, believe!
And then Calvin's like, ""Oi!""


You need to hold it down Jack, put your phone back
Quit starin' into space and eat your snack, that's that
She'll want you much more for not hangin' on
Stop me if I'm wrong, stop me if I'm wrong
Why should she be the one who decides
Whether it's off or on, or on, or off or on?
Now the girl's rude, I know she's rude
But she screwed right through you, you'll be on your knees soon


Hold it down, boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself


And I'm like, honestly, it's not like that
Your actin' like I'm prancin' like a sap
Jumpin' when she claps and that
Oi, do you really think I act whack?
'Cause I'm telling you, I'm servin' the aces
And it's game, set and match
Perfectly in control of this goal, I've got the lead role
Won't be foldin', I'm older than you told
Girl sold, high speed's gold
Game over, game over, too cold


Hold it down, boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself
Hold it down, boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself


Hold it down, boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her

She must have crab and fuckin' shrimp in her teeth

Lying on the floor
Staring into nothing
What the hell am I here for?
So come on and play
Stab it in my heart
So all this time was wasted
Ripping me apart


We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I've said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead


It's starting over!
Starting over!
Can't stand it's over!
God is gonna take me out!
My time is over!
This time is over!
Why is this over?
God is gonna take me out!


Crawling on the floor
All around this space
Talking to myself
What is this thing I gotta face?
Walking through a door
Has it been a waste?
Going on and on
Thinking I could find my place


We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I've said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead


It's starting over!

My time is over!
This time is over!
Why is this over?
God is gonna take me out!
God is gonna take me out!
God is gonna take me out!


You can't see
I'm torn away from you
And everything that's close to me
I cannot face the truth
It's nothing that I believe
Just run away from me
And thank me when you're free from me
Come take me!
Come take me!
Come take me!
Come take me!
Come take me!

Lost in the void of what is dead

Ride through the air, the heavenly stair
Over mountains, forests and seas
Mystical clouds, creatures around
Stealing the air that I breathe


All alone on the wings of an eagle
Catching the eye of the storm
And you wish to put on a curse
On the day you were born


Flying high through the dark of the night
Do or die on the edge of a rainbow
Flying high, safer place out of sight
Touch the sky and feeling the wind blow
Flying high


The journey goes on through the twilight of shadows
Passing the moon and the sun
Stars are shining like the eyes of the devil
Lucifer's breed on the run


All alone on the wings of an eagle
Catching the eye of the storm
And you wish to put on a curse
On the day you were born


Flying high through the dark of the night
Do or die on the edge of a rainbow
Flying high, safer place out of sight
Touch the sky and feeling the wind blow
Flying high through the dark of the night
Do or die on the edge of a rainbow
Flying high, safer place out of sight
Touch the sky and feeling the wind blow

I wanna meet tomorrow
Yesterday made me a fool today
I tried my best to follow
But you're moving too fast on your daddy long legs
You say I'm destined to live in stories
I can't let go of 2008
You say my nostalgia grows when I don't even know
That the way you're proposin' to say my name


Oh, oh , oh, oh , oh, oh 
I gotta let you go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm letting you know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta let you go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, now I know


You think about our ending
I think about when I met you though
Dad says I'm just pretending
Said that I'm just scared that I'll end up alone
I walked around Hawaiian mazes
I didn't care I forgot my bra
'Cause the dragon teeth ain't worried about letting go
Of the tightness I hold on the rope like a soldier


Oh, oh , oh, oh , oh, oh 
I gotta let you go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm letting you know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta let you go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, now I know


I make myself believe that I can go
That we've been up and over, then below
For heaven's sake, would you leave? Shut the door
Let me go, let you know why
It's gonna take a minute to unfold
The way that I've been feeling's overtold
Telling me why you left and then complain you're alone
And I don't know why
But, babe, it was something 'bout the way you loved me
Yeah, now I don't know, now I don't know me anymore
I'm letting go and you don't have to tell me twice
And you should know, I never needed your advice
I should've known back then, now I know it's right

When he went into a trap
Now, he's making better ones
On a higher step

On a warm summer day
The doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now, his hips are aching, what a deal

Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right
Time is right

Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers
And they do it their own way

They mix some DNA
Some skin and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Helloween

Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great politicians
And their time is right

One night, he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought
Well, never mind
Took a syringe and blew out his life

Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great possession
And their time is right

Lets them run into the night
They become a great oppression

The juice that’s spent every time you work it

Despite differences you see

I’m in disbelief at what people will believe
All along I thought we had our hearts on our shirtsleeve
If one thing I can say as a piece of advice
Don’t believe it till you see it and then see it twice

Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life
Drinking in the small town firelight

Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive


There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
While she starts to cry
Mascara running down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""


This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen


And that's where the beginning of the end began
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancing at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night


Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, ""Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot""



This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen


The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair, and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Crying 'cause I know I'm never coming back


This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him

Pray and pray
And pray for my downfall

Menace, scene from the movie
Clap the two, weigh the oozie
Goodfella jewelry heist
Diamonds in my bitch doobie
I sit back, think about the cats
They hate man I laugh at them
Get outta line I blast at them
They stay scheming
Fuck around let off a clip
And leave the whip leaning
They dreaming
I took the cream and
Move to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, shit
Cause when I flip
I make the paper
Dangerous, G-Unit
Niggas can't bang with us
It's undeniable the kid is nice
The flow CPR
I'll bring Biggie back to life
Man, Dre say I'm loony
Em say I'm moody
At least I don't smoke oolies
And fuck without rubbers
A handful of niggas hate
But the hood love us
You can pray
For my downfall
Motherfuckers



Even if I slip
I'll get back
Nigga act up
Hollowtips'll
Tear your back up
Gain 30 pounds
When you die, no lie
I was high when they hit me
Had a few gats with me, shit
Ain't get a chance to let off
They shot me up and sped off
Apologies in order
Tamia I adore her
But now they strict
Cause my flow make money
Flow like water
Turn it up a notch
Twist the dutch
Zone to this, soak it up
See me in the club son
I'll send niggas to poke you up
You know my style 40 cal
With me when I move around
Squeeze, catch the shell
And run before your ass
Hit the ground
Pussy niggas shouldn't talk
Keep my name out your mouth
Summerjam, understand
I'm the man
When I leave the crowd leave
Shook closer, game over
Ride or get rolled over

I'm waiting for a sign
I'm standing on the road
My mind outstretched to you
I'm picking something up
I'm letting something go
Like a dog I'm fetching
This to you
Pictures in mind
Rows of poppy fields
Harmony entwined
Changing gear that grinds
Pictures in my mind
Pictures in my brain
Electrical energy
Fighting drugs with pain
There's a war inside
Pictures in my brain
I'm looking for a job
I don't know what I'm doing
My software's
Not compatible with you
But this I can't deny
I know that you can fly
Cause I'm here
On the ground without you
Angel without wings
Owner without things
Sharpshooter without rings
Around you
The road we used to ride
Together side by side
Has flowers pushing
Through the dotted line

And my fear up inside of me

Soon as the sun went down

Tinkering around

Was more about life than fixing cars

About Grandpa and the war
While he was trying to show me
What a carburator’s for
I learned a couple cuss words
When he skinned his knuckles up
And I found out Momma was the only girl
He ever really loved
Then I asked him about women, he just laughed
Said if we stayed out here all year
We wouldn’t have time enough for that

And I just want to see you smile
Now forget about what it is, yeah
So baby, take my CD and baby, press repeat
It ain't no need to speak, just let it play


Well you got my attention now 
I can't let you down, your lyrics and your sound 
Imagine me and you, what we gon' do
Just listen but wait before the breakdown


Let's listen to some love music, love music
Lay back and just let it spin, this music is your friend
Love music, love music
Nobody has to know
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Can't wait to get this party started 
I'll hit the switches, let me remix it
Sit back and listen to some love music


No matter what the record is
Anytime it plays, girl, my heart skips a beat
I feel it in my soul, I'm about to overload
It's taking control of me
We're the perfect harmony, baby
Let's just keep the speakers blasting
And I won't stop 
'Til we burn out together


Let's listen to some love music , love music
Lay back and just let it spin, this music is your friend 
Love music, love music 
Nobody has to know 
Let's listen to some love music, love music 
Can't wait to get this party started 
I'll hit the switches, let me remix it 
Sit back and listen to some love music


Love, love music
Love, love, love music, love music, love music
Love, love music

"I know you're disappointed
I can see it in your eyes
This isn't what you wanted
And now you realize
I ain't no knight in shining armor
Who comes a-ridin' 'cross the lea
You're lookin' for a younger man, not me

Now, the merchants in the marketplace
They're selling fantasy
It's a trick of light and shadow
It's not reality
It's just a faded photograph
Of the man I used to be
You're lookin' for a younger man, not me

I knew the day I met you
It was never gonna last
You're an angel from the future
I'm an old devil from the past
So, trust me when I tell you
This is the way it's meant to be
You're looking for a younger man, not me

If you believe in better days ahead
For this crazy human race
That we will somehow be delivered
By goodness and by grace
And if you're lookin' for believers
In faith and hope and charity
Then, you're lookin' for a younger man, not me

You're lookin' for a younger man, not me
You're lookin' for a younger man, not me

I'm searching for phrases
To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun


A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye


My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours


Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen


They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They're lying there dying in their blood
Two-timing Slim
Who's ever heard of him
I'll drag his corpse through the mud


It's now or never
More than ever
When I met you I didn't think you would do
It's soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you

It's 50 a.k.a. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of livin' to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it


You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9?
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
If D's ran up in my crib you know who droppin' dimes


You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'

You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
The fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar
If you play with my paper you gotta meet my Beretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out


You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'


Me I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV


'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I gotta eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they goin' murk 50, how?
We ridin' round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?


You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'

The women of this family
Seem to feel that they owe it to the
Men of the family to look relaxed
Rested, and attractive at dinnertime
For you
They live in a quiet monastery. for you
They wear whatever you want them to as long as it is short
They count to ten when you tell them how to drive and
When they're afraid they let you speak for them


All hail the
King of intimidation;
Model of good Christian behavior


For you
We wax, nostalgic-ened our legs. for you
We chew our nails if we had any left buy fake ones to do it
We counted to ten temporarily and it was
Something about how you talk down to me


All hail the
King of intimidation;
Model of good Christian behavior


The room of compromise is full and apparently you don't want some
Theres only so much we can do to make your rest assured


I am
Single i am weary
You're just
Jealous you're just confused your just
Hungry you're missing out
You're not healthy
You i pity


All hail the
King of intimidation;
Model of Christian behavior
And he knows not of
What he has wrongly done
So forgive his ignorant behavior

Tortured you are captured you were busted we were silent
You were tested you knew better you are lonely

The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all, oh


I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow


The apples of the valley hold
The seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh


Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow


The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow 
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back


At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!
Ahhhhh

Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back

You think you know what the hell I've seen
You think you know where the hell I've been
I'm from the places people never really talk about
'Cause they don't even know where to begin
The mom and dad that I never had
Were just the first of the MIA
Had the teachers and the preachers and the coaches and counselors
But everybody faded away

Fake it sympathy, you don't care
Yeah there's hell on earth, I live there


You can take me to the devil's house
You can show me where the devil waits
So let me in, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates


Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything
I'm not tired
Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me
If this is hell, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates
And push me in the fire


When you said that you loved me too
You didn't get what it really meant
Can't lie and cheat and steal and leave
And think you're ever gonna see me again

Take it out on me, your M.O
Left in hell on earth, all alone


You can take me to the killing fields
And you can show me where the devil waits
So let me in, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates


Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything
I'm not tired
Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me
If this is hell, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates
And push me in the fire


I've got this feeling
Like I'm coming undone
I don't know where it's from
But I know that I like it
I've got this feeling
Like I'm coming undone
I don't know where it's from
But I know that I like it


Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything
I'm not tired
Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me
If this is hell, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates
Push me in the fire
And push me in the fire

Fire!

I had my first crush in season 2
She passed me notes and filled our hands with glue
And in my corduroys we'd walk to school
I sat and crossed my legs like Jim would do
She moved away, I was on season 3
It hit my heart so hard I'd hardly speak
But I could find some peace and privacy
A paper company to sit with me


Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?


I turned down Jameson when I was 12
I spent that Friday night with Steve Carell
The one where Dwight became the head of sales
My eighth-grade graduation wished me well
I lost my grandpa during season six
I watched my mom, she cried and held her kids
My mind was broken up I couldn't think
So I just hugged her the way Michael did


But who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?


Wonder where we're going
Tell me who I am
Take in every moment
Hold it close again


Now the finale's done and I'm alone
I'm on a Netflix trip here on my phone
But who I am is in these episodes
So don't you tell me that it's just a show


Who are we to wonder where we're going?
Who am I to tell me who I am?
Let's take it back and take in every moment
Who am I to tell me who I am?


Who am I to tell me who I am?
Who am I to tell me who I am?

One! Two! Three!


And if I had something to say to you, I’d whisper it softly
Ki-kiss you on your rosy lips and never let you off me
Sh-shiver on our roof and see your face lit by starlight
Hold you through the night and watch that Colorado sunrise


I’ve got five fingers on each hand for every mistake that I’ve made
‘Cause my tongue is tied to tonsils and I need to shit and shave
I’m a shade too pale for handsome and have habits I can’t shake
But if you try to take that from me, well, I’ll never be the same


Train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
A train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
A train wreck


And as long as it’s okay with you, I think I’ll stay right here
I think I’ve got nowhere to go ‘cause where to go is up to you, dear
You’re happy as a clam, I see the glimmer in your eyes
Hold you through the night and watch that Colorado sunrise
I got no car and never cared because I got no place to go live in
A room, a single wall, I couldn’t pay a plant to grow
You can try to make this pretty, pick up all my dirty clothes
And if you never really get me then I guess you’ll never know the


Train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
A train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
A train wreck


I’ve got five fingers on each hand for every mistake that I’ve made
Plus, my tongue is tied to tonsils and I need to shit and shave
I’m a shade too pale for handsome and have habits I can’t shake
But if you try to take that from me, well I wouldn’t be the same


Train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am

A train wreck
That I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am

Train wreck that I am

And I am what I am, what I am, what I am

And I am what I am, what I am, what I am

Tell me can you see me now?
While you were busy lost in the crowd
I was busy making myself
Into someone free from doubt

Started calling
Singing words that came from all the fallen
Down, down

So everybody just scream out

No chains, no chains won't make me break down

No chains, no chains won't hold me down


Tell me how it feels to know
I'm not a puppet under control
I cut the strings a long time ago, oh

Cause all you was the fire for my soul
And now I'm up here running the show

Performance down at Santos, Phantom suicide doors
Paparazzi slide-shows, showers with the slide doors
One night, five shows, two-seater, five hoes
Eyes closed, I can see them hating through the blindfolds
Niggas better switch it if the business ain't the convo
I'm all about my chicken nigga you could call me Roscoe's
If I wasn't spitting I'd be probably flipping waffles

And we on the grind, that's until I get my paper long

And being alone is starting to take its toll
I'm cold and it's getting old 
I admit  I should have made some changes

I can see it in your eyes
Soon you're gonna be gone


And I know I'm gonna miss you
My love I will send with you
'Cause I've been down too long
And you keep doin' me wrong


And there will be no more tears for you
Gonna be no more crying now
Gonna be no more tears for you
See, my eyes have run dry
And there's no more tears


And no more sadden eyes
From crying through the night
Gonna gather up, gather up my feelings
And lock them all inside
So when you say you're leaving
And you walk out my door
I got to move and say to myself
You cannot hurt me anymore


And I know I should be crying
But instead I'm slowly dying
'Cause all my love has gone
From two hearts so badly torn


And there'll be no more tears for you
Gonna be no more crying now
Gonna be no more tears for you
See, my eyes have run dry
And there's no more tears


And I know I'm gonna miss you
But for love I got me someone else
'Cause I, I been down, been down too long
And you, you keep doing me wrong


And there'll be no more tears for you
And gonna be no more crying now
And gonna be no more tears for you
'Cause you see, my eyes have run dry
And there's no more tears

No more tears for you

No more crying now
No more tears for you
My eyes have run dry

No more tears for you

No more crying now

No more crying now

No more tears for you

I know she said that I don't need her
'Cause every time I call, she's sitting sweeter
Oh, and I know she said to get near her
But I'm feeling cold and I must leave her


Sat down here with my head hung down and I just seem to find
A bit of peace, a bit of love, a bit of something left behind
Sat down here, best intentions, nothing said, nothing lied
A bit of peace, a bit of love, a bit of something left inside


And my heart's content, I say that to please her
Happiness is on her face, it's not mine that greets her
Only my disgrace to admit I need her
But we all fall from grace, dust me down and keep her


Sat down here with my head hung down and I just seem to find
A bit of peace, abit of love, a bit of something left behind

With a dram glass in her hands
She's drinking away her troubles

Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
A shinin in the moonlight

She was standin' on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four strapped around her
And a banjo on her knee

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain

Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty girls were made for lovin'

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto


I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn’t pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin’ G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it’s a motherfuckin’ riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you’re not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can’t have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto


I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto


Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
I predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas, yesh
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto


I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Yeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto


I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The Penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather I'd be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto


I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?

I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes
Goodbye, bye

Goodbye!


Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!

Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!


Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying


You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye , bye

Your ritual everyday
A mild shower soak in aftershave
Best clothes do your best
Look in the mirror go on
Belittle yourself yourself yourself

You go on day after day
Dreaming on a lie
That you keep locked inside
Of yourself

Can you sleep tonight
Cast aside for some pouting young pup
Sink into a slurred veneer
Alcoholic haze so now
Least you can like yourself yourself
Least you can like yourself yourself

Reservoirs of guilt
That your fixed grin always hides
And yourself

Of yourself

You look at ads all day
Everyone is perfect and you're so lame
Free scent burns your skin
But no smell can really cover sin
Too many teenage holes to fill
Too many teenage holes to fill


You go on day after day
Speak to your despised
Blanking your loved ones
And yourself

I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say ""I love you""  But I ain't into makin' love songs Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life I introduced her to this hippy life We make love under pretty lights, LSD 
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night  them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system  make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love  it takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams


It started in Hollywood  Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, ""I really wanna let it go""


I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh


Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?

I swear we gon' have drama if you touch my tailored garments
All you see is niggas here, so that means it's triggers there
What you mean? We got weed, and codeine and bricks for sale
I bet a lot of niggas plottin' so you know I got that heater, bruh
Drive my side of Harlem, catch me ridin' with my nina, bruh
She got an apple bottom that remind you of Bonita, bruh
Oh you mean like Q-Tip? Now that girl my new bitch
Excuse me, no, I believe the proper term's excuse you

You just flew out of your nest

Starting a brand new quest

But the world is trying to test

And you feel alone and try to mold into the rest



Babybird, grow some feathers
Yeah yeah
Babybird, you can do better


Mommy's not here no more

You're the only mouth you gotta feed for

So sharpen up those claws

You gotta find your own voice



Babybird, grow some feathers
Why fly with the chickens when you can fly with the eagles soaring?
And the eagles big but now why fly with the ground when you can fly with clouds?

Why fly with the chickens when you can fly with the eagles soaring?

No brother to tell my troubles to
My nights were oh so sad and lonely
Until the day that I met you

White walls surround us
No light will touch your face again
Rain taps the window
As we sleep among the dead


Days go on forever
But I have not left your side
We can chase the dark together
If you go, then so will I


There is nothing left of you
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye


Cold light above us
Hope fills the heart and fades away
Skin white as winter
As the sky returns to grey


Days go on forever

We can chase the dark together

And as we sat a-courting, my love fell off to sleep

I drew my saber through her; it was a bloody night
I threw her in the river, which was a dreadful sight
My father often told me that money would set me free
And so I murdered that dear little girl whose name was Rose Connelly
Whose name was Rose Connelly


My father sits at his cabin door wiping his tear-dimmed eyes

Now I'll never stop believing in chance
I put my heart on a shelf forever
I never thought I would find you
I didn't know any better, baby
But then I realized that your


Love is just an emotion away
I know it's gonna get to you
Love will be only a moment away
A moment away you know it's true


Love is crazy, love, love is crazy
And soon you're going to get some

Everywhere you look, you can write a book
On the trouble with a woman and a man
But you can not impose, you can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand


But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And whose car is parked next door


I thought I knew her well, I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right when she held me tight
How could I be so blind?


But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
Whose car is parked next door

A heart is on the line each and every time
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along it keeps going on
As long as you keep it outta sight

Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight

I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
And his name is...


Busta Rhymes in effect
Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my 'spect


I'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor
Can't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother
Funky in a sense, but I play the undercover
Once had a fetish, fetish for some booty
Now I'm getting funky in my rap and that's my duty
Brothers tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothers then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a 
My motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks
Girls love the jim, cos it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the oomph cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swing, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we driving for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensil
Write my rhymes straight up, don't give it no fancy stencil
The rhymes be getting sweet, we stay away from tart
A perfectionist at work, perking up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is coming up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, or deeper still the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a Quaker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?
The crazy move faker, I use that to break her


Phife is in the house 
Uncle Mike is in the house 
Bob Power is in the house 
Tim Latham is in the house 
Wise Men is in the house
The Brand Nubes is in the house
The J Beez, they in the house
And De La, they in the house


I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by the ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
Some women in the 90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug cause the beats are hard but gentle
Africano lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and you're coming to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching
To Black and Puerto Ricans cause they're butt naked streaking
Through the ever murky streets of the urbanized areas
Blasting out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria


Craig is in the house 
Pete Rock is in the house 
CL is in the house 
Ultramag is in the house 
Nice and Smooth is in the house
Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house
Special Ed is in the house


Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And this one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
And check it out, going into the '91 decade
Up in until the 2000 decade
You gotta say the Quest is on
And goddamn it, yes the Quest is on
And we out!

You probably go against me, and weep
I oughta kiss you, you'd probably like that
But you don't stand a chance, nigga

I do more than talk that, I mu'fuckin walk that
Blue Yankee cap back, fuck around get clapped at
I sleep with the stainless, I walk with the stainless
Man, everybody know about 50, I'm famous
New York, New York, I run New York
Ask Dread at the weed spot, I come through in the mean drop
In different boroughs I have different moments
On different days niggas know how I'm on it
I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga
I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga
I'm a hustler don't get no bigger
Queens, Southside 'til they bury me
BX, two TEC's, flames out the nozzles
R1 One wheel, Christian Dior goggles
Spar with me, start some shit, send the shooters out
Come out the club, we out front with the Ruger's out
Nah, ain't no sense to talking peace, my brother
That beef will probably send your monkey ass to see Allah


These niggas ain't strong enough
Their money ain't long enough
When they bump heads with me
They find out the guns do bust
We getting paper, in God we trust
These sucka ass niggas
These niggas ain't strong enough
Their money ain't long enough
When they bump heads with me
They find out the guns do bust
We getting paper, in God we trust
Suck on this, nigga


When I said I'll kill ya, I'll kill ya, as a kid I wasn't kidding then
Special ED kid in the back on Ritalin
Crib all fucked up, hooptie all fucked up
Pockets all fucked up, now nigga, what's up?
I'm rich now, niggas know about my dividends
Look at the Robb Report, check out what I'm living in
Fuck a spot now, I'm 'bout to buy a yacht now
Crib the size of the New York City block now
Okay okay, try me and get shot down
I'm like a zebra, I got so many stripes
I'm the fucking general, I run my clique right
It was five of us, all of us millionaires
Now one's a fucking junkie, and one's a fucking queer
Now it's three of us, that's the way we started
They call me crazy, cold-blooded and black-hearted
I don't play no games, niggas beg for mercy
Then we ""T.O.S."", put that ass to rest

Every time I see you, girl
If I had my way it would be you kissin' me

Listen, baby girl
I just wanna say to you
I still remember the day
When you were standin' in front of the school with your friends
I know you special
'Cause when you went to kiss me good-bye
I couldn't even wipe the sugar off my lips

Can I take another walk with you?
Maybe after school and talk to you?

The atom split, and you got back-engineered
You're a forgotten face behind a beard
That's it, that's all

Though I've been master of the thankless task
Nearby are questions you just have to ask
Was every enemy
Bad as you made him be?
Or were they just
Some gullible stooge like me?

You got yourself disappeared
The atom split, and you got back-engineered
You're a forgotten face behind a beard

And soon enough I'd see the mill you put them through
That ""Irish Goodbye"" you do

At which your absence was cheered
You're a forgotten face behind a beard

I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on
I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand
Asphalt jumpin', junkie lyrical, concrete
My Jedi mind be moving me
Throughout the many dark streets
Backwoods, boondocks, whatever terrain
Auf Wiedersehen, Aloha, man our feet ain't the same
I won't abuse these shoes, these shoes ain't made for reversing
Then trudging through these motherfuckers' first album Footprinting, never ever ghostwritten, yo' shit free, bitten
Grab my shit with both hands, iron grip, steel mitten
Bloviated, Jarobi ate it and now it's gone
Closed mouths don't get fed or move ahead
To my hustlers with customers, scam my chicks just being petty
Trap lords with the fetty, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no

When I stopped, I felt lost
I'm two heels from the top tier
Really want to be boss
I figured it out, figured it out somewhere
Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere
When I stopped, I felt lost
Do you ever feel lost?


They wanna see my downfall
Turn a good day into a downpour
Thorns in the crown hit the cross I bear
Why they wanna see me hangin' like a towel somewhere
One eye, two bills, three tears, a heart still
How I'm feelin' in my mind right here
Think I'm moving, I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Maybe why I feel lost, yeah
How I'm 'posed to know how home feels?
I ain’t even on my home field
And again I feel lost
Was not a cruise that brought us here, again I feel lost
And I refuse to be stuck right here, yeah
I don't want to move backwards, no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?
I don't want to move backwards, no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me directions?
I don't want to move backwards, no


Moving backwards never, that was never the plan
Can I vent? I was content being my own man
Up until that night ill-fated, walking home I was faded
Po puts braces on my wrist like he was clapping his hands
How demeaning, y'all? Who could be blind to racism?
Bring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism
Instead of slaps, give him the dose of Ab wisdom
He'll make it out of the jungle some way
Hey, it's figurative, not a real place you stay
Ay, it's mind state filled with muck and malaise
Uh, I got direction without using Waze
Submitting myself to praying these days
Yeah, moonwalking backwards, it's only for stage


Feds lining up, in riot gear
And everybody's hands in the air
Four-five so get your ass found somewhere
Caught between hope and despair
Say it loud, what it take to make my niggas listen
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Cool out, chill out nigga, I'm cool
Cool out nigga, nah, nigga I'm through
Head down, ain't no tellin' what you gon' do

Stuck still, colour blind
Hoping for a black and white

When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on

Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall, and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me


When the meaning is gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me


What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me


Since it all begun
To it's reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me

Feeling mighty slowed
With the likes of you
Getting mighty spaced
Never had a taste
Of what you're going' through

Went from rags to riches
Then to ragtime screaming the blues

Everybody's good intentions
Try to make a fool out to of me

Got to make a fool

Sweet cherry o

You see more

There's some kind of freedom
I am searching for
Sometimes I think it'll turn up
If I just run out the door
But when I think of it
I don't know what it could be
If you find out, would you be so kind?
Please tell me


Oh I've never seen the night sky burn so bright
The mere vision could turn you blind
And I never knew it could happen like this
But you never know till you see
The day through


Life's what you make it
But it depends on where you start
And this woman in front of me
Says she'll meet my fate in her car
So where are we all headed?
And what was my plan?
She has no idea but speaks of
Some tall dark handsome man


Oh I've never seen the night sky burn so bright
The mere vision could turn you blind
And I never knew it could happen like this

Turns into some distant memory
You'll pass me by, but nobody seems to see

I'm getting high, getting high
Getting high on humans


Sitting in the next seat, dead heat summer
Staring at the ground in a lucid light
I can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
Running round my head in a holy fire
Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
Freshen up the air underneath the streets
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide


And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy


'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans




Elevate the headstrong dead long halo
Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
I can make your day glow sun to rainbow
Colour in your step, let me lose your mind
Animate the air with a stone cold question
Do you have the time? Do you hate your life?
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide


And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy


'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high

Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
And I'm getting high, getting high

And mama taught me if he hit you, hit him back 
Don't you tell me if you never fit a pack 
Mama told me if you gunning, don't look back
You kill these niggas, all my brothers told me that 
I was young and tryna run me up a sack 
See niggas thumbing and I wanted some of that 
Big girl was thumping and you know I hit his back

All I wanna do is fade away, fade away
I hope that God will forgive me cause I know that you ain't gon' miss me

You ain't gotta shed a tear for me, baby girl don't cry

I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes


No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes


I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes


No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes

Falling into your ocean eyes

When only prisoners sleep
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See an old man weep


She said her dreams were too far to be thought of
Her scars too wide to heal
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See a blind man kneel


She sailed away to a blue horizon
In floating thoughts she'd sway
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See an old man pray


She wished them luck as they left on their journey
Maybe she'd join them soon
But she lost her grip at the tip of life's fingers
Went home and worshiped the moon

Locked it away deep down inside
Told my heart we'd wait it out
Swore we'd never compromise

Than settle for the kind of love

Silence stared me in the face
And I finally heard its voice
It seemed to softly say
That in love you have a choice
Today I got the answer
And there's a world of truth behind it
Love is out there waiting somewhere
You just have to go and find it

A love that's real, love that's strong
Love that lives on and on

Oh, how I love it, really, it ain't for discussion
But the truth ain't that far from it
I keep on buggin', like fuck it, I'ma say it
Like fuck it, I'ma fuck up
Like fuck it, I'm a fuck up, and it's fucked up
It's just my dumb luck, it's just my dumb luck

Were my eyes playing tricks on me?
Was I really seeing?
Such a belle at 25 Wexford Street
I ain't gonna lie, don't recall her name
But the Dublin lights saw everything
Now the legend lives all across that town
An American boy and an Irish gal


That night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Let the sound of the pound bump in our chests
'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest
She left and the only thing left of her
Is one night, and my, what a beautiful blur


Black hair, blue eyes, tattoos dark as night
And her necklace just said ""dreamer"" on a key
I ain't gonna lie, I recall her curse
And the jet black ink of a Bible verse
The things we did, never thought I would
But the 23rd psalm never looked so good


That night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat

When my phone started buzzing
With my buddy saying 'let's paint the town'
It sounded good
When that sexy bartender
Nine or tenner said 'it's two for ones now'
It sounded good


That band cranked up with some Dixieland Delight
That singer might've missed an Alabama note, or five


But it sounded good last night
We had a damn good time
Jack Daniel's got a jackhammer pounding on my mind
Is that my exe's 4-runner backing out the drive
What I told her must've sounded good last night
There's a video of karaoke, me going viral
My fun money funds in a downhill spiral
Right now it sounds bad, y'all, I ain't gonna lie
But it sure sounded good, sounded good last night


'Angel here on earth
Did it hurt?' was my go to line
I thought it sounded good
Round my twelfth twelve ouncer, told the bouncer
'You wanna take it outside?'
He thought it sounded good
That's when they kicked us out
We hit the Texaco
Bought a pack of Black and Milds and some beer from Mexico

I can't look at you in the same light
Knowing what you did in my heart doesn't feel right
Yeah, my head's been tripping all night

I got a friend who's committed to sci-fi
He's read every comic, he's addicted to Twilight
He'll give you the Goosebumps
But he's never lead me wrong
He said, she's got a method of killing
Pulling you in like you're gonna start kissing
Fooling around until you lost all feeling
Sucking your blood until your heart stops beating


Before we started, it was over
I feel our bodies getting colder
She gives me
A feeling that I can't fight
And it's the road that leads to nowhere
But all I want to do is go there
She's got me
Running from the daylight, daylight


I got a taste for it and I'm obsessed
Lying here, no fear of the darkness
Now I'm not happy unless
I'm close enough to you
And all these dreams I'm dreaming
Freaking me out, I wish I knew the meaning
Doesn't make sense because I'm just not seeing
How I'm alive, it feels like I'm not breathing

Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everybody, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
They're cop haters
Here goin' against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud. It's too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music

Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz, ban 'em


Listen it ain't no stoppin' I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double
Try to stop it and touch it
I'ma cock it and bust it
Niggas fuck it I'm tryna get it addicted to fast livin'
Get rich or die tryin' nigga ask 50
I've been Operatin' Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government
Washed around by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screamin' Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice 
All the judges got grudges
Givin' my niggas life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all goin' through the struggle
Penny pinchin'
It's like you really ain't livin'
Resultin' on a 211’s, I'm cookin' in the kitchen
Like we lookin' and we wishin'
Prayin' will he hear it?
It's eatin' at my spirit
Speakin' for the spirits


You can't break me, never make me busta soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Delores Tucker sue me I won't stop
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies, tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites whistlin' Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? , can they stop me? 
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we comin' from
Life as an Outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop


No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down
We can't stop

Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not


I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggas don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep goin'


Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a MAC
If God strike me with lightnin', I'm shootin' him back
Skinny cause I won't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm, fuck the world 'til I'm gone
I'm buckin' at Corey Brooke he treatin' my niggas wrong
Until I'm gone
They gon' see who I be
I picture this bricks duckin' from the penitentiary


See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams
It's all wrong pop too long gone
And now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my throne pow like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Livin' life as a Don, guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton


Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearin' Red I'ma rock the green
On a whole 'nother episode
Cops never heard of ya
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
Catch ya man he dead with the fifth
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggas hate it but they scared of the fifth


Outlawz!


No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down

Until we reach the top

Real niggas don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep goin'

Cause it seem somebody hidin' me my nigga
Make a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stoppin' me my nigga
It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chillin' like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies, sharpen they miss
So when you see me they can give me a kiss
The one posin' with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin' a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm puttin' in work
Not an easy you wanna jerk
Call me squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlaw, Makaveli nigga ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggas what they screamin' at night
But Big Syko with the thug in your life
My nigga


Don't stop 
Keep goin' 
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rollin' 
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream 
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we livin' the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sittin' clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop


No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down
We can't stop

Until we reach the top

Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time

Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch
Play the game, nigga; all out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga: ""Why you lie?""
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B

Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said

Read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a ""chazzer,"" Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right

Oh no, but still sometimes I feel
Oh, sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now

And I will never see the day
Oh, I was nothing when you came
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh, all I do is just O.K
All of my nights, and all of my days
Oh-oh, if you came home right now
I'd run away

I can't believe it
I can't remember your face anymore
Or the sound of your voice, oh
Or any touch of your skin is a legend
By the way, did I tell you that I love you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm so sorry
You know I, I really, I really meant to tell you
It's O.K., there's no need to hurry
But the bed is full of memories, full of memories of you
Oh, I tried to get them out but, but there's nothing I can do
Oh, if I knew the moon I'd ask him
Shine his light in through your window
And send your body home to me today, hey

Hey, I feel this night will never end
And I will never see the day
Oh, I was nothing when you came
I'm no-one now you've gone away

You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back

False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds

It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars


You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians

That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision

Lyin' around home alone
On a rainy night like this

Starvin' for your love
Hungry for just one kiss

Every rain drop I hear
Against my window pane

Beatin' so loud and clear
Words that spells your name


Got nowhere to turn
Now that you have gone
And I feel like
Breaking up somebody's home


I know it's useless
Hangin' on when you belong to someone else

I can't shake my feelin'
'Cause, after all, I didn't make my bed

Last night I cried so hard
I believe I caught a chill

Can't control the vibrations
My heart just won't stand still

Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon, mm, but I know, I know, I know, I know

Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon, ooh, well I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home


Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own

But I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory

Even stars in the skies, they're wrong
Short days, when the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always free to run home

Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird

He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No, man""
But you can do the job while you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made

Until the other kiddies knock him down

Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way

You follow the drum

As the light of day
Falling down across your lost highway;

Why
Does it hurt this way?
To come so far to find they've closed the gates?


You’ve lost your tongue; when you fall from the pendulum
Your heart is a drum
Keeping time with everyone

If they drown from the undertow
Need to find someone
To show me how to play it slow
And just let it go


Your eyes get stung by the rays of the sinking sun
You follow the drum
Keeping time with everyone

Drugs backed in 'em mean them things in
Now it's duffle bags full of green men

What am I supposed to do?
Uh, now when the ones that didn't see me
They want a verse or two
Shit, what am I supposed to do?
Put 'em in a fucking hearse or two
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain

Or at least until polices came

And all the guns is in Kesha's name

This year forgot to call him on his birthday

Met a couple of convicts that's way beyond sick

From three halves of a four group doubt if anyone is normal
And over all it's hard to call who would try to play you

So, until that day I'm discharged and set free, fuck who's gonna sex me
My mind's more based on makin' my next G
Now, let's see, left alone me as a juvenile, no more movin' foul

Blessin' my mental with mathematics to map shit through graphics
Fuck it, I ain't with hustlin' backwards
A wiser man with ideas and liver plans
More mature and for sure done saw all my eyes can stand
Sittin', tryin' to design these words of mine
To define what occurs when you're servin' time
Stress just blurs the mind
Behind bars scars are signs of hard times
I'm trappin' myself in between these lines
But I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot

You won't find him where you think


""You won't find him down on Sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA""


Took a sip of his whiskey
Said, ""Now that you're with me
Well, I think that you should stay
Yeah, I know you've been busy
Searching through the city
So let me share the way


""I know I'm not your savior
Know I'm not your truth
But I think we could be friends""
He said, ""Come down to my level
Hang out with the devil
Let me tell you, in the end...


""You won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA""


And that is when I knew that it was time to go home
And that is when I realized that I was alone
And all the vibrant colors from the lights fade away
And I don't care what they say


You won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
I won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when I'm tripping on some pills
When they sold me the dream, I was just 16
Packed my bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame I came all this way

It's a fly love song


To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bonafide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my mama is sick I'm by her bedside
Used to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide
That's how the runnings go
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter 
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast
Cause I don't wanna see 'em, start bucking
Throwing chairs in the air while you be ducking
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promoting a show make sure it ain't wack
Or else I'm leaving 
I'm leaving 
I'm leaving 
Your wack show


Yo man what's up with that?
Yo don't sweat me
C'mon, five hundred, that was the deal
C'mon man, don't try to play me out
We don't need you, sorry!
And the Abstract rapper says


I want chicken and orange juice, that's what's on my rider
And my occasional potato by Ore-Ida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't taking no shorts no more, now
Please act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like you know
It's, the 90s, time to make moves
Not, the 80s, do away witcha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zu
Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of
And we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out


Diggy dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy

We both know that you wanna love her
Skies are open crying, please don't believe her
'Cause she'll tell you lies and then say it doesn't matter
And you're pleased to see her calling them non-believers


But maybe she loves you and I'm just a preacher
Those burning skies and all who don't believe her
Non-believers, no
Don't believe her, no


All that we are, all that we need
They're different things
Oh, maybe what we are and what we need

Heels and earth behind some broken creature

Let me get that intro
Blunts, gators
Hand me my mink


On the East duckin' Feds from a peephole
1989, gangbangin' was at its peak
This the beat that make me reminisce on G-funk
Three summers before The Chronic hit the streets
I would rather slang hand to hand to a fiend
Rappin' on the side, trappin' was priority
But every now and then I go scoop my little thing
Pull up in my MC bangin' New Jack Swing
Ooh, summertime time back in Long Beach
Passin' one bottle, 40 oz. O.E
I didn't have a dollar but a nigga had a dream
Whippin' over the stove and a nigga gotta eat
Threw my raps in the garbage, fuck bein' a MC
Thank the Lord for Nate Dogg and thank God for Warren G
Funny how time flies when you're high as me


I think I'm in the Ruff Endz now
I seen her throwin' up H-Town
You was livin' off of Dru Hill
Wasn't ready for the world but baby, who is?
Know you prettier than all the El DeBarges
Never worry 'bout the total of the charges 


And if you need an escape for now, meet up at room 112
We do it anywhere 
Ooh, yeah, and if you feenin'' 
Just call me, baby 
I'll have you screamin' 
Ooh, ooh


We'll get back to all that ghetto shit we like
But for now just let me hold you all night
Cheek to cheek just like they do in the movies
Tonight, baby, I want your love on time
As soon as I put this on
Cutie pie, you're the reason why
As soon as I put this on
I love ya so and I'll never let you go
As soon as I put this on, girl
Ooh, yeah

The hood kno do fo do lo ima solo cat
Fly photos no polo i throw those back
Hung up my scuffed soldier boots I holds no gat
Gotta crew of lil homies for that.. where the love at?
Still standin i ain't strung on crack
Still handle it like Pun on tracks

Neck froze, fresh clothes, the specs is silly
Adore for really, war like the lord Achilles
Im too illy, worth more than half a billi
So please feel my im direct effect
And since a kid at fresh fest I’ve been fresh til death


You know what it is.. ayo Fresh come on man , it’s how we do it.. let’s resurrect the hood ya heard?


The coke game is a regular, the stacks uneven
Pimp game’s still cellular, but rap I’m eatin'
Used to pitch packs in streets
Took it to the next level hard face watch made by Patti Philipe
Jars of dro the chalk just added to beef
Bars stay hot with raps thats grabbin the beats
Double nickle deep down in the bucket seats
Yatch match the Rolli, where my fuckin freaks?
Flow fast and gawdy with chinchilla minx
Hoes trash they bore me the kid barely blinks
Ma we can take it to another life level
Somethin like whole diamond round ya ice bezel
I heard a few niggas hatin on your nice fellow
But did they know your range cherry and ya ice yellow
I holla at you neccessary when it’s nice hello
It’s Fresh, 50 bricks nigga on my grind level


Ayo A talk to these niggas.. you know we poor but cop chilly wrists niggas.. stackin chips niggas.. and official hood figures


Been locked in since them wally moccassins and them drop top bm's
Ya’ll shoulda cock blocked me then
Now a dime later haters try n box me in
But like Iverson i skip hop to the rim back spin whip wop fake cock it again
It’s understood I’m the hood Hitchcock with a grin


Came in the spot wit 6 bad brawds, lift Jag doors
Never too gawdy but my wrist wrapped raw
Flip packs of raw, slick black valor
Reacquainted with rap now we rip half of these tours
Pull up at the summer league games Ashton Mar's
Hopped out the whip prada shit straps and all
The crack game is back so its fresh to ball
330 hard top cherry red bar watch

I handle pop niggas CL split top
So listen up to whos runnin the game
You know its Fresh 50 bricks plus the shit on my chain
Polo mitts so sick they just stick in you’re brain

And you could see Fresh livin good enjoyin my health
Now we runnin in the bars and we buyin the shelfs

It's all right to swim and sip it- let me have a little more

Love to find a little spot- nice and shady that's for dreamin' of the riches
Oh, tell me where are you hidden?
Ready or not man, I'm come'n in

Want to buy my time and finally own my fate
If you tell me no then I really must insist
And when the hunt is over kiss me on my lips
Kisses!

So let's talk 'bout our plan- you can count is gonna work
Carry on feel immortal- at the risk of getting hurt
I'm praying that it rains- so some day we'll be sowin'
Living through a little pain- no complainin' as we're trainin' for the riches

Oh, tell me where are you hidden?
Oh, all of a sudden
There you are

I'm happy that the sky is blue and that the earth is green
And that there's lots of fresh clean air sandwiched in between
I love watching as the snow makes brushes out of trees
Swinging from the tops of my guarantees

I've found a new planet
That only I can see
Just came back to get you
Let's leave this misery
Nothing can reach us
So far from harm's way
Only sunshine
And rainbows every day
We've got to get back there
Hurry up and get your things
The countdown has started
Go ahead, try on these wings
Don't need no spaceship
For what I'm thinking of
Didn't I tell you
That I'd take you
To the planet of love
I got tired of losing
But now I'm in control
So help me start packing
We don't have far to go
I found a new planet
Don't revolve around the sun
We'll make a new start there
The journey's just begun
Won't get into trouble
In our new world so far above
Didn't I tell you

To the planet of love
Didn't I tell you

You say you're tired of staying home
And you can make it on your own

I thought this family was your life
You're a new woman, not a wife
And now you're chasin' a new dream
Found in a Cosmo magazine

That little guy and I will find our way
We never really knew you anyway
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son

I spent a lifetime lovin' you
Or was it just a year or two
The girl I thought had clipped her wings
Lived only in my boyish dreams

Someday they'll say your son looks just like you
But you'll never know if what they say is true
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how

Yeah, you cooked his dinners
You raised his children
And still he's not satisfied
He says ""I'd rather switch with you
You don't know how hard it is
To work from 9 to 5""
But he speaks with his eyes closed
And even though you're not all alone
He's never there to be with you
And you remember when you were young
When life was new and it was fun
Now every corner's filled with dust


But you're not coming home tonight


You just took the train
And you left without a wave
Figured he'd never let you leave anyway
And now you're sitting on that train
Seeing life in a new way
And every forest sings a song
One for the heartbroken lovers
And one for the dreamers
And then there's one just for you
The winds been humming on it all day
Ans the soil lies awake
Waiting for it's drum solo


'Cause you're not coming home tonight

Oramai non ha più senso

Ho bisogno di una donna
O se sto più bene solo
Mi domando se l'amore
È nelle pieghe di una gonna
O se è sparso per il cielo
Tu non guardarmi come fai
Spegni subito il tuo odio
Non c'è colpa e tu lo sai
Ma non ti senti un po' anche tu
Chiusa dentro ad un armadio
Sii sincera come sei

Io mi domando come mai
Ho nel cuore l'infinito
Dove non si muore mai
Ho capito dentro me
Non c'è un volto disegnato
Eppure tu nel centro sei
Averti credimi è per me
Una gran soddisfazione
Amar di più io non potrei
Però rinchiuso dentro te
Farei la fine di un leone
Su una poltrona a bere il thè

Ghost, ghost, I know you live within me feel as you fly
In thunderclouds above the city into one that I
Love with all that was left within me til we tore in two
Now wings and rings and there's so many waiting here for you
And she was born in a bottle-rocket 1929
With wings that ringed around a socket right between her spine
All drenched in milk and holy water pouring from the sky
I know that she will live forever, she won't ever die


And she goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
Where no-one can escape

And one day in New York City, baby, a girl fell from the sky
From the top of the burning apartment building 14 stories high
And when her spirit left her body, how it split the sun
I know that she will live forever, all goes on and on and on


And she goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid

The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday, but he don't listen
The poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen! I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money but never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy cause he left me?
Wish he would've hugged me
Too much like him, so my mama don't love me
On my own at a early age, I'm getting paid
And I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray?
I'm hanging in the back streets
Running with G's and dope fiends, will they jack me?
Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose, everybody gotta die
Say good-bye to the bad guy

Buck-buck from a Glock let the glass fly
Do or die walk a mile in my shoes

Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us from a MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Straight soldier, bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
See me striking down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna
Ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me, nigga
Zig-zagging through the freeway, race me, nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw
I'm living raw, til they bury me, don't worry me, I'm high
Living like I ain't afraid to die
And if you could walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
And every day there's a million black bodies put away
I'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave, cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo, creeping out the window
Alone, on my own, I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household
I'm out cold, on the streets screaming 'Motherfuck peace!'
I got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do I do?
Live the THUG LIFE, nigga, stay true
I wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?
Lord forgive me, if you feel me
Cause all my life I was dirt broke with no hope
Little skinny motherfucker wanting dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
Anyway, it's so hard on a nigga in this city, no pity
And ain't no love for the scrubs that be buying dime
If you could walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too

Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls
Night after night for the glory we fight
In a kingdom of madness and the tales from the old

Death by our hand for the higher command
As the darkness surrounds us hear the cries as they fall
Fire burning steel and the tyrant will kneel
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword

Set sail for the glory, pray for the master of war
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands, endless rise to the heroes before

Cry thunder! Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder! Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day for the demons we slay
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all
Chaos still reigns devastation and flames
For the ultimate glory when the legacy calls

March on through the hellfire blazing from the darkness beyond
Nightmares return of the thousand screaming, rise for the heroes once more

Cry thunder! Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder! Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Unholy darkness in the eyes of broken dreams
Outside of the wasted and torn
A land of tears still remains
Soldiers of destiny calling
And the fallen will rise up again
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Warriors defending, one final stand

And flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away

You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind

Without a single thing
I gave into your ways
Which left me with nothing
I've given into smiles
I fell for your games
I wish so bad right now

Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my brain


I scream without a sound
How could you take away
Everything that I was
Made me a fucking slave
Your face that I despise
Your heart inside that's gray
I came today to say
You're fucked in every way

There lived a little boy and he drank all day
Friends called him stupid and his brothers called him gay
Emptied all the bottles 'til the pain went away


Whiskey was his friend, he didn't have another
Vicodin his vice, his real and only lover 
Smoked a pack or two, it never was a problem
Popped a pill or two, they really made him blossom 


Take a sip, take a sip, take a sip
And I trip, and I trip, and I trip
And I'm like, run ya bitch, run ya bitch, run ya bitch

Their motto is don't tread on me

Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go

Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait

And I call it ""Beggar's Tomb""
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Rebel ... rebel
Rebel
Rebel ... rebel


They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
From a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain
So with a little bass and treble
Hey mister, it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC
They won't be happy 'til I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face
Pump up the bass, and join the human race
I throw peace to The Bay
Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground


Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel

Now I'm face to face with the devils
Cause they breedin' more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
Shit, it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin' 'em up once mo'
Now the fox is in the henhouse
Creepin' up on your daughter while you sleep I got her sneakin' out
2Pac ain't nothin' nice, I'll be nothin' how I wanna
And doin' what I'm gonna
Now I'm up to no good
The mastermind of mischief movin' more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel - the rebel of the underground


Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground


They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel - the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
Cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout
So what's wrong with the media today
Got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm comin' from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So, yo, to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin' records 'bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalypse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground


2Pac is a rebel

Briar patch raps gash tracks in sections
Kid says this and need witness protection


Trying to say what I can't be saying
I'll be here
Trying to say what I can't be saying
I'll be here


Yo, dig this, dig this

Yo, it's the junkyard, crooked letter C-I-EN-tific
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum
Hear one line I let loose, find me fearsome
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone

Testing the eight hundred-eighteenth battalion
Shall I go on? Crews run like rebels
Enola Gay rhymes kick the notch up a level in intensity
Send back attacks that you sent to me

Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me
Empty three verses on thirty-three emcees
Swiss cheese your gear, putting shrapnel in the breeze
Bleed emcees of enemy companies

With my hand full of lyrics, talking ‘bout, you want these?
Please, don’t even speak the name of Ken
On some go-go-Gadget mic shit
Put it down like pens for my friends and my fam

Better Dodge, or I’ll Ram
This mic shaft through the back of an emcee’s hand
With the strength of He-Man, a Cringer don’t want that
Close-bodies fill fields in hand-to-hand combat

Battle cats in cypher sessions of speech
Warfare of words flashing that cordless heat
Compete for an edge, lyrical shots get lit
Don’t question my intention when your bucket gets kicked

Had to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
How to lean back, fake a yawn
Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss
How to turn a twenty into Saturday night
How to make her momma let you have her til midnight
How not to let her know she's got you caught


These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout a promise and forever
All you know is nothing's better than being together
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl


How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make 'em sound so sweet
That she'd never ever say no, no no no


These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout living ever after
But you know you're nothing unless you get to have her
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Oh, you won't believe the way she's got you acting
She'll talk you into things you never thought would happen
When the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Mm, yeah, just a girl
Mmhmm, just a girl, just a girl

Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first

I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day

Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

Little homies on the roof with the blam, blam, blam!

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
You fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean  and love hurts 
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time


Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing  paper 
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time


You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before

Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heart-broke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went

And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her

Blind yet hypnotized

While a nigga still living

You should exercise your wisdom

We just get distracted by the conventional ways of living
But it ain't enough to certify a spot for you in heaven
Unless in flesh you were golden with clean karma on your records
Time is hectic, niggas killing for cash like every second
Reckless spending, do we got enough wealth to feed the peasants? Damn, get the message dream free and independent
Hope our people get to stepping cause our brains the strongest weapon
Mama told me stay connected to my dreams and count my blessings
Cause these so called friends would end this shit for some treasure
I don't slip got grip like some leather, Starshifts with my brethren
Trying to keep it all together, conscious gleaming any weather
Pardon me I'm light like feathers
And I'm reaching heights you never thought you see me climb
Remember? So partner please recline
I've seen the clock and It's my time
Proceed to watch from distant lines, but i dare you to flock a genius mind

 
Told him I'm a winner, are you winning?
We gonna rule the world don't you forget it
Baby if I'm your girl, I'm a rider

I come through in some cums girls frats
Lay down bitches so then roll nine blunts
Face to face 'till it's roach for roach
If you see my girl nigga don't approach
I'm so faded off that indica
Words so cut like some domindica
Weed off this planet
I'm on different worksmissions
Took seven hits, put it down said, ""i forfeit""


Live the righteous way, praise the sun
And live the righteous way
Praise the sun and live the righteous way 
Raise your gun and let the light just blaze

Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
I just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?


Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yeah, when you knew I had some other place to be
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?


Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately


Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Alright so where are you tonight, sweet Marie?


Well, I don’t know how it happened
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
But everybody else, even yourself
They’re just gonna have to wait


Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?


Well, I been in jail when all the mail showed
That a man can’t give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie

The most hated, most underrated
But it is, what it is


Cartier's studded frames on my facial
By this tint, you can sense I'm bi-racial
Benevolence of a pimp and I'm grateful
Heaven sent, I was meant for a late view
Lived the life, unknown the most
Never boast, got that grown approach
I get it in, professor with the dividends
Doe or Die, succesor of my sibblings
You know it
From petty crimes to a street poet
It's all the grind, steady mind, taught to keep forward
The game's crucial, no gangs I remain neutral
It's more fruitful, trueful I'm living beauful 
What the loot do, love it or leave it
Minor beef to above it to breathe it
Reclining seats, fuck how others perceive it
I'm doing me, hip-hop since Spoonie Gee in ziplocks
So I ask why y'all fooling with me


I work hard 
To get the things I have
I work hard

Why you wanna, playa hate on me 
Why you wanna, playa hate on me

Imagine this: no money, just arrogance and hungry
Can see a sex freak, fly mystique and spunky
Comfy amongst the streets why y'all creeps is lunchmeat
Frauds, like emotional broadsthat's on their monthly
Grungy, violence is the only respect
The stress numb me
Death is the last thing left
So get from me if your math ain't matching your words
I know the half so when I laugh I'm just relaxing my nerves
Love furs, diamonds is a mans best friends
His and hers is all captured on the camera lens
I'm what it was, for the buzz and the torch was lit
Never a dud, you all bug, get off my dick
Y'all need hugs, I'm just trying to mind my own
Little patron, few shines, all kind of colognes
Monotone, it's assertiveness that come when you grown
I sense nervouseness, y'all know I'm in that murderous zone
But still courties, shake hands and kiss the kids
Make plans with the Ms. take trips to live
Why bid when the smart got a lot of advantage
It's a art, so know that y'all involved with a mammoth
Single handed, never taken nothing for granted
Never fronting, my face ain't never touching the canvas
Understand this

Pretty bad bitch that's old yeller
Finna fuck a clip out for fellas
Get it crackin' on a bitch like a old leather
Toupee'd on a bitch like an old fella
Souffle on a bitch cause my dough better
Used to go to Mickie D's with no cheddar
Now my chauffeur I get fuckin' so feta
Now let's go to Sue's Rendezvous
Most of your crew be strange dudes
Two bitches like déjà vu
Blowin' that skunk like Pepé Le Pew
Make it hot in here like Nelly
Make her side burn like Ashanti's 'do
Murderin' Ink like I'm Irv Gotti
Fuck around and sing like I'm Ja Rule

It's the player you heard of, the young and assertive
I came from the dirt up, and did the unheard of
Hoes say I'm the man, mm-hmm I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment, what the fuck is the purpose?
Don't call on my phone, unless you're the fam or my girl
I'm a just say it's no service, stay connected as cursive
I bet if you put my name on it that I make it bigger
She saying she wanna take a picture, I let her take a picture
But don't send it to me 'less it's fuckin naked pictures
Feel me, I'm into safe sex-y, latex-y, rubber stretch-y
Good weed, no stress-y
You can get your broke bestie, show your chesties
Tell your boyfriend to stay off my testes, lil' bitch
What he tryin' to say?
Make that 9 shake, pump up the crime rate
Pump up the value, make that bitch vibrate
Pump up the alcohol on the hydrate, she thirsty
And that's a damn shame
Red bone, white money, blue dream that's my campaign
I order Hors d'oeuvres, roll up more herb
I hit it, I bust, and throw it to Ferg, for sure


Fuck around and sing like I'm Ja Rule, hah
Fuck around and sing like I'm Ja Rule bitch
Aha, Sean Don, A$AP Mob nigga

Good riddance to a bad affair

Swipping and swapping the foreigns 
You niggas cannot ignore it
I’m swippin’ and swappin’ the foreigns
Swipping and swapping the foreigns 


I’m swipping and swapping the foreigns
Might go to church in some Jordans
I might go buy me a chopper
Then I’mma buy me a lawyer
I got a check from the barn
I got a neck full of bone
I got a neck full of Bentley
Maserati on my arm
I get that bread in the morning
Somebody pass the croissants
Somebody pass me a lighter
Somebody pass me a joint
I’m using my rap for intimidation
Using my gat for a demonstration
If my car ever got impounded
It would be locked up for illegal immigration
That’s a small thing to a Godzilla
Got me more bars than a bartender
I met a car dealer, my car came with wine
And yours came with some malt liquor
Swipping and swapping the pack suit
I wish I had me some ack
The bitch that I’m with is foreign
On our first day I had took her to sex




Swipping and swapping the foreigns
Balenciaga performer
I think it’s time for war
I might go battle in my armor
And if I kill you, it’s karma
I will not tolerate shit
The youngin be thugging his own 
Advise you not to get hit
I do this shit for my momma
I been in this shit since pajamas
These niggas don’t mean me no harm
You come any closer you’re gonna need arms
I promise, because niggas ain’t seeing me really
I ride the choppa to Denis
And they say the choppa be kissing
Don’t play, you’ll be left with the hickies
I beat up the bully
Hopped in the bed with a witch
Switch up on all of you niggas
My bitch is foreign
She always touring, she bored
Might have to switch up the foreign on bitches
Fucking with Chainz
Might gonna see me on tour-ling, nigga
He put them forgies on everythang
Even the spinner, goddamn!

"Well, it's not fair, it's not even close
You tied me down, where I'm forced to watch as you poke holes
In every part of me containing something secretly
Something sacred to me

I lied my face off when I said that I would be okay
It's never fine when you go away
These cuts run deep, these scars are permanent and always on display
This makes things difficult for me

It's not fair, it's not even close
You fed me the sun, burned me up inside and watched me choke
On everything we did, on everything we lived
Let's see if I can live again

I lied my face off when I said that I would be okay
It's never fine when you go away
These cuts run deep, these scars are permanent and always on display

Like watching newborn babies crack from work-related stress

It's like insanity is hanging on a thread
The flesh feels cold underneath your nails
And the look you give me never fails, never fails


I love the way you hurt me
I love that you don't care
My love is dark and twisted
And I scream when you're not there


It's the interesting way you pierce my brain
It's within my urges but never the same
I love it when you help me, you crack a smile
The best is when you make it last a while, last a while


I love the way you hurt me
I love that you don't care

Well I'll bet by the time I get to Tulsa
She'll be pulling on them tight blue jeans
She'll go down to Cowboy's, buy herself a cold one
And on a Friday night in Dallas, she's a cowboy's dream
Something tells me she'll sit out the first one
Then they'll play George Strait and she'll be gone
Cause heaven knows that girl was born to two-step
And Texas women don't stay lonely long


It's a fact that women like the one I left
Can find somebody else, any time they want
It's a shame, but I'm afraid the one I love
She don't like waiting much
Texas women don't stay lonely long


I'd sure like to think she'd wait forever
Welcome me back in with open arms
But she don't walk the floor, she don't count the teardrops
And she don't pick up pieces from no broken heart
I wish I could call and say I'm sorry
But there's nobody sitting by the phone
You know she meant it when she told me that she loved me
But Texas women don't stay lonely long

Using a fake ID at a college bar
Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything


Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
Or telling Supercuts, ""Let's leave it long in the back""
Wearing a tux in a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything


Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
'Cause there's a last time for everything


Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing ""Already Gone"" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything


Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything


Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything


Biscuits and gravy at your momma's house

Spring break on a fold out couch

Little Jimmy on the Opry stage

Hearing Prince sing ""Purple Rain""

Been ready

Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong
Cuz' I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on
Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
""Is he really fucking with Sean?""
I reply, ""His pick, I would take a tool on.""
Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later
Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
Came back definition of a ""young motherfucker"" with a problem
""Future of the West Coast"" I am
And that's real tough
Southern California, Angels, AKA LA's Chucks
Make comparisons when I seen him duck
Man you think ""What was to Pac and Big, before?""
And that was before
I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
And then I started writing with it
Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll
He is cut from a different cloth
Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost
Like igloo, every time I come off
Every time I take off

30,000 feet and still won't fall
Why you do that for?
Why you had to sell out that store
You made my record sales come up short
My reply is that it ain't my fault
Blame God


I can't wait when its my time 
No I take that back, cuz' I got time 
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you

And every body quiet, know its my part

Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit
I never played the bench

Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog
Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles
I never had no flaws
""Ooos"" and ""Ahhs"" after every bar
Take your bitch, then give her back
For no reason for, just because, ya'll actin hard
I'm bein myself
And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord
Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
Back seat got a flock of broads
And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like ""Sure""
Momma gon' clean or fix it
Use Terrific, Easter Brum????????
All it need is a little season on
Who said a veteran can't be so young?
I sound better than half ya'll on

I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform

To this, I insist B it's weak to dis, see?
I'm runnin' up so suckers stick to your 40
How could I give a damn, give a damn

Get up, get up, get up, freak out
Get up, get up, get up and rock this beat

Outta whack as the master laid out the music

Death, I just say fuck you
The void unknown we're thrown through
While lost in life's psychedelic trip we take
There's another more bizarre we have to make
World we have, nowhere beyond
Take out the earth, the bass is gone
At life's end we'll feel the calm
How strange we should be here at all

If you don't have someone to
Do it with it's not worth doin'
To all my friends, it's not the end
The earth has not swallowed me yet

Come on, jump, come on and rock this day
Come on, jump, come on and rock this day
Come on, jump, come on and rock this day

Into whose womb were you woven?
What kin of your skin dropped you then? Body's cloven
Light of daybreak blinded next exit
The wild darkness forming inside it
My day wasn't promised me, each death it brings
Reminding me we are rumbling in this
Cursed universe where death is birth
Think not but what your manifest is worth
Giving up a verse, the curse, occurs a thirst
To burst first breaking through the center of the universe
Slamming down on the lingo flow
So jam to the bumrush single
Long ago has been become now
When you find out there's no break in the rhythm
Black anima makes my stamina
Stand alone, disown the cinema
Farewell to posing decades dozing
Comin' up the steps of the new screen rising
Scenes from the lost world, shapes hard to tell
Which is which as if drawn by a child, holmes

If you don't have someone to
Do it with, it's not worth doin'
To all my friends, it's not the end
The earth has not swallowed me yet
If you don't have someone to
Do it with, it's not worth doin'

This is the heat to flush your face, come on
This is the heat to flush your face, brother
This is the heat to flush your face
Come on, freak out

One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
 Ohh 


Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, ""Stay down"", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up


One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory 
Ohh 



Now the war is not over, victory isn't won
But we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done
We'll cry glory , oh glory , oh 
We'll cry glory, oh glory, oh 


Selma is now for every man, woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now
Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose, to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
Enemy is lethal, a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory


One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory

When did lust for you become an organized crime?
I tried to keep you honest, babe, but I was just a pawn
You played the part so well, it hurts to know you're gone


Did you mean it? Could you feel it when you broke into my head?
Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed?
Was it worth it? Was it perfect when you up and left me cynical?
Like you planned it, you're a bandit
Just a no good, two-bit, filthy, rotten criminal


Let me count the ways; I six, seven, ate my words
Right from your silver plate, we checked in, checked out, checkmate

You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day

But I always thought that I'd see you again


Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground


Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain

Like damn can’t you see that I’m about little bit of busy
And you don’t know why I’ve had you on my mind
But I’ve seen this before it’s a symbol it’s a sign
To unwind, to relax, hit the club, smoke the gas
In the party we be jumpin and the bass yeah it’s bumpin
So just know
I ain’t talking to no one else
I ain’t talking to no one else
Tonight is all about you, you, you , you, you

Chorus:
Baby you can be my lady tonight
You just have to ask
And you don’t gotta worry bout this time
Cause this won’t be our last

"He likes to act like he's all grown up
He wanted to grow up to be
An actor, but he never told anybody

He likes to spill all of his guts
On the top of a well stocked bar
And then swallow them bit by bit
Remembering every scar

It's a valid reason for every drink
And a new tattoo is a new reason to think

He likes to pretend that he's all sewn up
It makes for a much stronger case
But there is blood underneath that skin
That scar is not so easy to erase

He walks with a glass cane now, he's careful
When holding his body up straight
Can't go outside anymore when it's raining
Can't smash up that beautiful face

Another innocent girl just made his list
That self pity shit is just too hard too resist

Yeah, when we get home, you'll see
That this part of him is now part of me

He likes to act like he's all grown up
He wanted to grow up to be
An actor, but he never told anybody

He likes to spill all of his guts
On the top of a well stocked bar
And then swallow them bit by bit
Remembering every scar

It's a valid reason for stronger drinks
And a new tattoo is a new reason to think

Yeah, when we get home, you'll see
That this part of him is controlling me

Deep, underneath the ocean

Takes me to your home shore

Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito

Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

E volavo, volavo felice
Più in alto del sole ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva, lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me

Ma tutti i sogni nell'alba svaniscono perché
Quando tramonta, la luna li porta con sé
Ma io continuo a sognare negli occhi tuoi belli
Che sono blu come un cielo trapunto di stelle

Volare, oh oh...
Cantare, ohohoho...
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
Felice di stare quaggiù

E continuo a volare felice
Più in alto del sole ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare negli occhi tuoi blu
La tua voce è una musica dolce che suona per me

Volare, oh oh...
Cantare, ohohoho...

Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
""Two teas both with sugar please"", in the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and ""Hey mom
Do the papers say anything good?
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?""


Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback, the honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the '68 summer festival wallflowers are thinning


For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town


And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Hmm, couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb


For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down

From the end of the world to your town
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change

Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leecher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead, you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy but Rocky been Jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met J-Hov

No, it ain't a movie, diamonds in by new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing

I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, save the bullshit for the q-tips

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost


I will offer a sacrifice of praise, I know it's gonna cost me
The cost is not greater than the cross where you bought me
I was lost and you sought me, I was ignorant, you taught me
I was impotent against my enemies, you fought for me
I exist for your glory, never for mine
I never would shine if it wasn't for your Spirit inside
You made me alive when I was dead in trespasses
The passion of Christ left my sin in the past tense
Every good and perfect gift comes from your hand
You set me back on course when I run from your plan
No excuse to refuse to lift my voice
Because the gospel is true, there's always reason to rejoice
And that don't mean that my sorrow is inconspicuous
But when I grieve, I got a greater joy in the midst of it
The joy of knowing I will see you face to face
And it's all to the praise of your glorious grace


Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost


Oh God full of glory and grace
Open in me a fountain of faithful praise
Let it flow from the depths of my heart like great lakes
Let my soul be the sweetness that spreads its fragrance
Save me from the love of the world that you created
More than the God whose beautiful hands made it
Break me from pride and consecrate me
Make me feel the weight of my sin, sorrow and safety
Let me sing with the saints of your great salvation
And join in the songs of all creation
Let the winds obey, the oceans wave, the mountains cave
Let every star you placed display grace
Let my speech do the same as the skies proclaim
Let everything that has life and breath bless your name
Let the earth be the stage where all creation aims
To heaven in endless praises and adoration


Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

They found him in the gutter at the business end of another Friday night
Someone who'd clearly been there before
I didn’t feel I had to ask him why
I have never understood why we need to know
The reasons for everyone else's strifes
Sometimes you don't need sympathy
To get the words right

Caught in anguish
He was
Sometimes that’s enough
And he was singing


Oh, looks like the end again
Her body bleachin' out into the waves
It's still the loudest thing
Oh, I wish I had all my friends
Somewhere drinking
The sunny afternoon
Into oblivion
But that's not your fault
How could that be my fault?


So we walked into a house party
Of someone, someone somehow knew all about
And all the young girls turned up late and drank us all to some kind of stand still
With looks of ""Heard it all before""
And distant ideas of death and thrills
And in absence, asked the host if he had any left
And somehow I did feel like yesterday was ours
But it's gone
Yesterday was ours
All along
And they were singing


Oh, looks like the end again
Her body bleaching out into the waves
It's still the loudest thing
Oh, I wish I had all my friends
Out there drinking the sunny afternoon
Into oblivion
But that's not your fault
How could that be your fault?

Sometimes we feel the power of God's great hands are felt by some not worthy
While those who sing and praise God's name seemed to be passed by
But worthy or not, God loves us all, even a little bird that couldn't fly
Why is life given and taken away too soon for some to tell
And others live for many years and walk a path to hell
A cripple since birth may speak God's name in tender tones with pain
While a man with health and friends and wealth will take God's name in vain
But God's reasons must not be known or questioned by me and you
Like the little bird I saw, the bird that never flew


I feel close to each thing that God has made, the earth, the sky, and the sea
And each creature living here belongs to Him, even you and me
And one day while I was walking alone admiring some of God's beautiful things
By the path on which I walked, I saw a small bird that had no wings
So I sat down and I held out my hand and that little bird climbed upon
And I held him for a long, long time, I thought maybe that his mamma might come


At last he looked at me as though he knew
That he'd found him a friend and a home for a bird that never flew
So I built him a little house on the ground like few birds I'm sure have ever known
And he seemed to be so happy there with his new friends and his new home


And for two years I fed him and I watched him as with the other birds he'd play
But when they got tired of playing, they'd just fly away
Then a look of loneliness in his eyes as he'd watch the birds fly into the blue
But then a look of understanding as though he knew why he couldn't do that too


And then one summer evening at sunset, I saw a perfect picture of love
Everyone of his little playmates were beautiful snow white dove
Then the ruffle of their feathers as they started into flight
Then I noticed that all the doves but one was white
And he looked like my bird, but he had wings of solid gold and brand new


And then I knew it was my bird, that little bird that never flew
Until then

Every time I think about you
I get chills along my spine
It's feelin' I'm not used to
Can't believe you're really mine


Other loves, so complicated
Broken hearts and twisted minds
Then you came, and I'm elated
So unlike the other times


It's so pure, it's almost sacred
Simply put, it feels divine
I just love you, pure and simple
Pure and simple and sublime


Don't it seem we've spent a lifetime
Looking for that perfect love?
Like a dream, we finally found it
Pure and simple; well, good for us


It's so pure it's almost sacred
Simply put, it feels divine
I just love you, pure and simple
Pure and simple, sweet and fine


I just love you, pure and simple
Can't believe you're really mine
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

I'm alone, head strong
Now we on a mission
Stomping out all the rules of the game
Anti up, sleeves up
Now you got the vision
Bullet proof
And we're not gon' change


The world eyes looking down cause we seem different
We got each other and who cares who knows
If ignorance is bliss why they still bitchin'
Haters eat our dust cause the winds gon 'blow


They say that we are only
Hopeless and alone
And they say we don't know who we are
Hold on now


They can't come between us
They'll never defeat us
We won't break so easily
Hold on now


Come out of the darkness
I know that you can find your way somehow
Trust your gonna find it
Baby it's alright
You're born to fly
Just hold on


Misfits won't quite
Get your arms up
No one else can bring it like us
Rock and roll with the punches
Lights out
Hold on when the goin' gets tough


They say that we are only
Hopeless and alone
And they say we don't know who we are

I don't know which way to go
When it's dark outside and I can't say no more
Try to fight the world alone
I am lost silence and nobody knows
Then I, I remember when we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
And we, we would conquer them one by one
But tonight, let's stand alone


Nobody sees me, now I'm a one man show
I'll do this alone
We knew it all, but right now I just don't know
Guess I'm heading home now


Now I know I couldn't stay
Had a million words, didn't know what to say
When I gave my soul to take
And the devil took it, I faded away
But I still remember when we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
And we, we would conquer them one by one
But tonight, I stand alone


Nobody sees me, now I'm a one man show

Don't let my feelings
Keep you from the rest of your life
And all these reasons
That I probably won't stay the night
When you wake up I'll be gone
I'm gone

But I'll go alone 
You'll be busy waiting 'til I get home
Well, if it's not me and it's not you
Is it these games we play
'Cause I won't lose
You know I'd try if I was yours
But wouldn't I stay with you

You'll have fun doing what you like
Summer days, some were living right
Simple things for a simple mind
But honest, you got it
Whatever it is, you got it
The heels, the way you want no one
'Til you're runnin' outta options
Talkin' problems, I ain't got none
Where have I been?
I been vibin' on my way up
You were 'fraid of solo ridin'
Sun is rising, look outside and
I am flying out while you're still asleep
Won't interrupt your dreams
I'm hoping that you


Don't let my feelings
Keep you from the rest of your life
And all these reasons
That I probably won't stay the night

When the fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The sound of music in my ears


Distant bells, new mown grass smells
Song sweet
By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down


And if you see, don’t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me


When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Children’s laughter in my ears
The last sunlight disappears


And if you see, don’t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

You need a reason to believe
A reason to deceive
A reason for the song you're singing 
And everything you do makes perfect sense to you
So why is your alarm bell ringing?


You say you know how it feels inside of me 
Lost and alone with no love or luxury 
Come on inside and hear the silence constantly judging me 
Don't you think you should move on?


Aah-ya look, you're so 


You need a way to get along
A way to carry on
A symptom for the pain you're making
And surely, you should know
That everywhere you go
There's acid in the words you're faking


You say you know how it feels inside of me 
Lost and alone with no love or luxury 
Come on inside and hear the silence constantly judging me 
Don't you think you should move on?


You write it, so you best believe it
You sold it, now your soul perceives it
You waiver, but for now, agree with it

To hell with that!

To play the sidenigga knowing you can't let it show

Bitch you not gon' play me if I want you, he don't keep you happy
I'm not the type to go and really care but damn I miss it when you used to run your fingers through my hair
And pictures being sent to each other just to have em all
Drunk nights made you happy, me and you always had a ball
After sober blunts 'bout what we did the night before
Silly convos through the text we never called each other's phone
Cause I knew my place and now it starts to get to me
Cause knowing I can't have you when I snap back to reality

Hey, yo, when this first started off it was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all, it was KutMasta Kurt with a remix


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
When I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter


Ay, yo, one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shaked, and made eye contact
Partied and toasted strong, all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No opportunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up, you weaken your system
And had to throw it up
I brought you back into things
Like imaginary man of your dreams
You'd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt leather, never pleather
Real bringing the pleasure
By any means, it means I'm leaving your team
Hell of a team, man, it seems but I tried so hard


I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

And hadn't even tried to crawl

Stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now, chock full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter


In the end

Sugarhill remix
Hell yes


At times I window watch out the Mariott
Zoning on owning co-ops, foreign drop top coupes and yachts
Guzzling straight shots of scotch
Formulating up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot 'cause it's scorching hot
Making it hard trying to figure who's out to trap me
Pataki got all kinds of undercovers coming at me
Perhaps he won't be happy 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be sitting in Coxsackie
But never me, see my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstacy on a hill—that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make living this a must, plus this is real


I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby

I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
 and lets count this money)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby


Ayo son, pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the Grants in the safe, cause we spending the Jackson's
The Washington's go to wifey, you know how we do


No more cutting grams, and wrapping grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seeking for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed to treat ya
Laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid
Wearing the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Caribbean cuisine
I guess being down for so long I'm all in store to see my dreams


I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby

I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
 and lets count this money)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby


So until I see past the green pasture, me being supreme master
Ain't much more life to fiend after, but another chapter
A new way of life to adapt to 'cause these streets'll gas ya'
And have ya' caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killa crew more hospitable
Consciously aware plus political
'Cause though they claim that every man's created equal
Us as native people find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established we eating lovely, living lavish
Like the house of Versailles, Paris—I gotta have this
It's so plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough, to make living this a must, plus this is real


I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby

I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
 and lets count this money)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby

And when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you

I know it's hard to find the words so often standin' face-to-face
Sometimes it takes a thin white sheet to put things into place
Things that I could never say come floodin' out somehow upon these lines


I'm still fightin' the same battles I've been fightin' all these years
Dream is not a dream unless you're livin' with a fear
What they say will be forgotten, all that's done will be for naught
And why?


And it's been a long time, Lord, since I sat down and had a cry
It's sometimes overwhelmin' and I can't tell ya why
But I remember Jackson singin' ""Doctor, doctor, please""
My eyes




My heroes, they're all dyin' or they're sittin' in a cell
Due to years of medicatin' minds that hurt so well
There's a thin line, don't you see, between genius and insanity
Which am I?


One thing that scares the hell in me is livin' with mortality
And worryin' that I'm insane talkin' to a God unseen
Must surely make me crazy, so crazy's what I'll be
'Til I'm gone
'Til I'm gone




And I'll scream out to the sun and to the moon and to the stars
I'll scream until my voice finds you, no matter where you are
I'll scream until I've got no breath and all that's left to take is death
And I'm done
When I'm done

Hello from the mountain
From a god's eye view
But to sleep in the lowlands
Where I dream best with you
Morning from the ocean
Beneath a summer moon
But all I want is to dance in the fountains
Where I move best with you


If the worlds gonna end
I wanna be your friend
When the lights go dim
I wanna be your man
Tell me what is heaven if our souls are split in two?
I want to be your man

Till the stars burn out
I get lost in the static
When I hear your sounds
Over and over again
I lose my sight
Oh but it’s so automatic
When I see your light

I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion

Me Ilamo Roberto y estamos buscando a Jaden Smith


I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay; why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type?
Why don't you take that mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
""Why you always rap about bein' gay?""
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called ""faggot"" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah


Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down

Break, break, break the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack, crack, crack
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack


I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty

I got my hand on an ounce, and I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'

I took an eighth of them shrooms and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing

I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them


Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer 
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins 
When I cop that feel, I do not think 'bout diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didn’t do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie, and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on Atlanta


Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling, wondering, ""why?""
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving


Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk, that want a lady like
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like 
And yeah you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say ""Why not?""
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Timing all fucked up, thought you had just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say, ""Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?""
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy


Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'

Draw a line in the sand
Like there's nothing to regret and nothing to prove
Set my sights high enough
So I see the turning tides are parting for you


Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you'd never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on


No more time second-guessed
Like there's nothing to forget and nothing to lose
Hold my ground long enough
Till I see the turning tides are coming from you

Take it back with no regrets

In the rising water, in the rising tide
They're spilling over me, filling my insides

I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses


And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known


He speaks, and the sound of his voice
Is so sweet, the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing




I'll stay in the garden with him
Though the night around me be falling
And he bids me go, through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling

Left in the dead of night
And I was there, when three months later
You were standing in the door all beat and tired
And I stepped aside

Everything goes away
Yeah everything goes away
But I'm gonna be here until I'm nothing
But bones in the ground
So quiet down

We were opposites at birth
I was steady as a hammer
No one worried cause they knew just where I'd be
And they said you were the crooked kind
And that you'd never have no worth
But you were always gold to me

And back when we were kids
We swore we knew the future
And our words would take us half way 'round the world
But I never left this town
And you never saw New York
And we ain't ever cross the sea

But I am fine with where I am now
This home is home, and all that I need
But for you, this place is shame
But you can blame me when there's no one left to blame

Oh I don't mind

I've never known where you've been
There were holes in you
The kind that I could not mend

Wasn't that fun? Let's try something else


Forty-five caliber killer, but out of the Phila-
-dela thriller show you brothers how you not a guerilla
Smooth talkin', fully automatic weapon concealer
Taste thriller, great fillers, hit 'em with the bounce filler

Filthy stinkin', standin' on solid ground and still be sinkin'
Submergin' in the Parks and still be Linkin
Pluck beef when it starts, but fuck your thinkin'
It's not a mirage

I rip the motherfuckin' track up from out the garage
Where I'm hip to the duck, but it's hard to dodge
In the back of that spine where my darts is lodged
Thought flippin' straight up, rippin' apart your squad

X-Ecutioner style, that cuts and blends
Like a syringe, we bangin' you in each of your limbs
See me comin' through your party hard, without no bodyguard
Smokin' somethin', stompin' on each of your Timbs

I'm the B to the L, the A, the C-King 
And when it comes to plannin' the Thought, keep thinkin' that

Eee ah ooh ah ah, Eee ah ooh ah ah
Eee ah ooh ah ah, Eee ah ooh ah ah


People hear and wonder and they wanna know how and why
But let me first introduce myself, I'm tagging name Romye
I'm 20 years of age, I ran across some bullshit
People promise you bowl of cherries but don't forget there are pits
No hints, it's quicks, it's like the water and grits
They got another boy who can rhyme and do the fly flips
And that’s I, Hi, I better get by because my ally
About to flip that crazy shit while I go look for some thai


I need some zig-zag, zig-zag
I need some zig-zag, zig-zag
How I need those zig-zag
 zig-zag, zig-zag
How I love to get high

What the?
Oh, what the heck
Niggas just wanna get wrecked to the track
It's brand new and heavy as a Chevy and in fact
The Pharcyde is coming and I hope we're not wack
But at this point there's no turning back
But to be exact, I've got more flavors than a bucket full of fruit
In '92 we take cash, '93 we take loot
Because the vinyl is delicious
I'm the nigga who's ambitious
Michael Ross is the genie he's giving our wishes
One, I wanna just jam with your band
Two two two...
You gotta play it all across the land
Three three three...
The plan is grab the ducats and say ""fuck it"" to the critics, hey now
I was walkin' down the street bellin' to the beat
Phat beats in my head, tennis shoes on my feet
Nigga tried to flex but he had to be smoked
So I shot him in the ass on the downstroke


Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
What?
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Yep
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot-him-in-the-ass-on-the-downstroke


Souped on the beat like a bowl of chicken noodles
I love Spanish dishes, but no, I'm not Menudo
I can dig Kung-Fu, I flip hoes like Judo
Never date a chick who has a mom named Bruno
Or Edna bonedna, bananafanafuno
Yet you know Shafino, met her in a trio
Souped up my glass jet, flew her ass to Rio
I'm somewhat Creole
Don't like the man of steel
I'm not your carbon copy but your first draft jalopy for real
I used to deal but the fuzz popped me
I had the hydros but they repo'd my crops and steel
I chills like scotch on the rocks
'Cause I just gets paid for them hardcore props
You know?


How long can you freak the funk?
How long can you freak the funk?
I separate the good stuff from the junk
How long can you freak the funk?
Yeah, freak the funk
All right, freak the funk
Freak the funk
Freak the funk
Freak the funk

I want the farmer man

I want the farmer man

Yeah, I want the farmer man

Give me the farmer man



I go from Skip Scott to hip-hop to be-bop to P-Funk
Cutting enough bullshit to turn a tree into a tree trunk
'Cause we've sunk ships from the Pacific to the Atlantic
I dig dips who've got the hips that are gigantic 'cause I'm frantic
Take you in a frenzy
Takin' you out is easier than pullin' a pull-out out of a Benzie
Box when I rocks the orthodox styles to make you squirm
Yes, I come from Cali, no, I do not have a perm
I stand firm on the mic device when I gets nice
Don't roll the dice if you can't pay the price
I got more flavor than 7-11 Slurpees
If Magic can admit he got AIDS, fuck it—I got herpes

Damn!

There's no parole, there's no great escape
We're sentenced here until the end of days
And then my brother there's a price to pay

We're only human, we were born to die
Without the benefit of reason why
We live for pleasure - to be satisfied
And now it's over there's no place to hide

It's such a brutal planet
It's such a living hell
It was a holy garden
That's right where Adam fell
It's where the bite was taken
It's where we chose to sin
It's where we first were naked
This is where our death begins

We took advice from that deceiving snake
He said don't worry it's a piece of cake
And sent us swimming in a burning lake
Now we're abandoned here for heaven's sake

Here's where we write their names
Here's where the money god is
Here's our famous hall of shame
Here's where we starve the hungry
Here's where we cheat the poor
Here's where we beat the children
Here is where we pay the whore

This world is such perfection 
It's just like paradise 
A truly grand creation

Built idols out of mud
Right here we fed the lions
Christian flesh and Christian blood
Down here is where we hung ya
Upon an ugly cross
Over there we filled the ovens
Right here the holocaust

Myself! Myself!


What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again


By myself  I ask why
 I can't rely on myself
 I ask why
 I can't rely on myself


I can't look around 
I can't hold on 
I can't slow down 
I can't look back 


If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer


By myself  I ask why
 I can't rely on myself
 I ask why
 I can't rely on myself


I can't look around 
I can't hold on 
I can't slow down 
I can't look back

The weakest man I know is the man I see in the mirror
But it's okay to be inferior when you know Christ is superior
Much stronger than my fears and doubts, He's the Overcomer
He holds me up when I'm overwhelmed by the weight my soul is under
From the highest throne is flashes of lightning and rolls of thunder
Yet He knows the number of hairs upon my head, I'm full of wonder
That the One with universal power would be personal
With His creation as He unfolds His gracious purposes so perfectly
I was purchased by the death of Jesus, crucified in weakness
I worship a God who weeped, who intercedes for me while I sleep
Yes I know He hears my cries
He doesn't roll his eyes but rather He sympathizes
And reminds me that all my needs have been provided
I have no reason to trust that I could be strong enough on my own
So I gladly boast in my weakness
That Christ's power might be shown
Manifested through my life to prove my faith is genuine when tested
Cause in the depths of my weakness is when my strength gets perfected


Almighty God, omnipotent
You're my confidence
You're my confidence
I am so convinced
You hold me in my helplessness
You're my confidence
You're my confidence
I am so convinced


Yeah I understand what means to be branded as a Biblical man
But I can't stand the fact that I still try to live up to man's standards
It's really hard for me to be perceived as needy
When everyone around me seems to be succeeding
While making life look so easy
I'm constantly fighting this feeling of failing as a father
And this feeling of falling short as a husband
This sort of never measuring up
Of course it's all in my mind, it's just an expression my pride
Yeah I get it, but it's still hard for me to admit it sometimes
I get so tired of taking refuge in my own strength
While standing with the weight of my insecurities on my back until my bones break
It won't make a difference to my situation as a whole
Whether I tend to hold it together for the moment
Or pretend to be in control
God mold me into a man who holds fast to your everlasting hands
Give me the strength that I need to get past my circumstances
God rescue me, make my desperate attempts cause me to confess
My dependance
And may the depths of my weakness make strength perfected


Almighty God, omnipotent
You're my confidence
You're my confidence
I am so convinced
You hold me in my helplessness
You're my confidence
You're my confidence
I am so convinced


Almighty God
Almighty, almighty
Almighty God
Almighty, almighty, God

Whole world! From the high country to the bottom of the sea
I caught a place that I needed to be
It comes and it goes, the momentary glory
Then, quick as they came they’re down the drain
Another one coming from a shallow place will not remain
Remember when what was possible would never end
Now we abide by limits I cannot defend
It fits good and yet the best we reject
You get what you get I guess don’t get upset


Where is that Garden of Eden
Under stars and the trees and
And so far, so far from the heathens
Planets follow patterns, our stars in the seasons
Flowing like a river we broaden and deepen

{​Chorus]
Hold on, before we are gone
Got lots to do but time with you
Keeps on sliding
And I keep on blowing a fuse, there you go
Unseen, your face in the screen
I feel your attention dividing
But this is worth more than the news


Prepare to bare all
I paint the cave walls
I am the hobbit
With the ring in the forest
I am the richest, I am the poorest
A particle I vibe I just keep dancin'
I move from this world into a mansion
Of light and love as below and above
I chart the planets and the whales migration
I'm home everywhere I run the station
The last light of a dying star
In every game I am that wild card
I participate I'm paleolithic
And geology and astrophysics
A true cowboy existential hero
I compiled that deck and named it tarot
I'm in play give me the ball
I'm Buddha with amnesia then sudden recall




Somehow I fell into it all again, it all again
Somehow I fell into it all again, it all makes sense
Somehow I fell into it all again, it all make sense
Somehow it was here all along

They called you when you left
Those hangovers just hang on a little longer
And home ain't your hometown
Just cause you got twenty bucks don't mean you spend it

Bigger houses, faster cars
Just trying to be somebody, but you end up somebody else
Friday nights out with your friends
Til a second chance's a second wind
Just one more candle then you tell yourself


Forty something
Is the new twenty five
You think time is on your side
But in a flash
Your fifty something
And your daddy's in the mirror
Say you're young, but your running out of where you're spending
Sixty something in a minute

Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices
I learned the voices died with me
When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power
Could barely tear my eyes away


All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash




When I was sixteen, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me
I knew this scent was mine alone


All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
Always keep them on a leash


When I was a man, I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

I'll be home for Christmas

And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love lights gleam

I'm down and I feel depressed
Sitting here, just waiting
For next bus travelling downtown
It's a crying shame, isn't it?


The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this, I know what I'd like to be


As free as a bumble bee
Take a sip from every flower
Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour


What a good life, lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life, living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

Spójrz jak szybko minęły nam lata te
Sami nawet nie wiemy, kiedy i gdzie
Stoimy tu, wokół ludzi tłum
Pytacie nas: „skąd ten smutny szum bierze się?”
Dziś pożegnać się nadszedł czas
Jeszcze jedną chwilę, a może dwie
I już tak jak dziś nie spotkamy się
Oooo...


Mamma mia, dziś jesteśmy tu
Tak, tak, po raz już ostatni
Mamma mia, czy wrócimy znów
Do tych wszystkich twarzy bratnich?
Tak, mamy serca płaczące
Choć usta są śpiewające
Bye, bye, tak musimy odejść stąd
Mamma mia, teraz wiemy to
Że to był ostatni w szkole rok


Czasem byliśmy fajni, a czasem nie
Czasem też się zdarzało, że było źle
Lecz kiedy znów wrzesień będzie już
Wspomnijcie nas i zetrzyjcie z pamięci kurz
Bo to czeka każdego z was
Na każdego ucznia przychodzi czas
Dzisiaj żegnasz się ty, a jutro ja
Oooo...


Mamma mia, dziś jesteśmy tu
Tak, tak, po raz już ostatni
Mamma mia, czy wrócimy znów
Do tych wszystkich twarzy bratnich?

It's the world famous AZ Show
For the world 


No doubt, time to mellow out
Party at the yellow house, yell it out
Invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laidback with the Alize, milli's concealed
Conversating like some more pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit stressed out supporting your bitch
Let the ice shine, easing my mind with white wine
Assured lifeline, sqeezing my nine the right time
Camouflage life, feds almost bagged the god twice
Bizare nights move on the grace of Allah's light
All Armani white, feeling like Christ with the army type
Cons be writing knowing my life is based upon the hype
Burning incense with intents to school the infants
The rules are different, so for those that chose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains


Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up 
All night 
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up 
All night 
Long

So many deaf and blind got caught up and left behind
I guess Bacardi Lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine
Next in line, slow G-ing, low key-ing
Me and the crew in the gold B.M. O.D-ing
Top speed, blowing through the sweet night breeze
Wherever life leads, anything's better besides a tight squeeze
Sliced cheese, even my pieces pushing nice v's
Dressed precisely, hoping soon one be the wifey
It's working well, process words, helping to purge and sell
Urban hell, playing park benches, burning L's
It's all basics, probation, open cases
We ill natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of satan, congregating
Conversating, trying to map ways of escaping
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels as souvenirs


Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up 
All night 
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up 
All night 

Long 
Long 
AZ, knock me off my dog gone shoes


For the world
No more case pending, it's all a brand new begining
AZ I'm back winning, dressed in black linen
Attract women, low fade, waves laid and spinning
Stay paid, four different ways, put my bid in
No sleep, be playing with time, my mind goes deep
These cold streets, rock a diamond chip, gold teeth
Trying to stay sane, amongst the madness and maintain
Though the game changed, the message involved remain plain
Poor advice given, we all strive for nice living
Insights, some pay the price others spend nights in prison
Plea bargain, hoping my peoples peep the problem
We each disolving trying to make moves to keep from starving


Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up 
All night 
Hey AZ won't you play that song

Pulling on my dress, holdin' me too tight

Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind

Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom


Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
Ahh, you don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now a man who won't let himself be


Down in a hole, losing my soul
Down in a hole, losing control
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied


Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will bring no more of my feelings beneath


Down in a hole, losing my soul
Down in a hole, losing control
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied


Bury me softly in this womb

I give this part of me for you

Sand rains down and here I sit

Holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom



Down in a hole, losing my soul
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
Down in a hole, out of control
I'd like to fly

Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own


Night after night, day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own


Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you, my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own


Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own


How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been through hell, what good did it do?
You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own

You pet your lover in the bed
Come here, I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy
His voice was low with pain
""I'll do your bidding, comrade mine
If I ride back again
But if you ride back and I am left
You'll do as much for me
Mother, you know, must hear the news
So write to her tenderly


""She's waiting at home like a patient saint
Her fond face pale with woe
Her heart will be broken when I am gone
I'll see her soon, I know.""
Just then the order came to charge
For an instance hand touched hand
They said, ""Aye,"" and away they rode
That brave and devoted band


Straight was the track to the top of the hill
The rebels they shot and shelled
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And guarded them as they fell
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again


But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said
Momma, you know, awaits the news
And she'll only know he's dead

About to throw these last few hunnids , this your last chance 
You lookin' like a laptop, I need a lap dance 
That ass would make a cab drop and leave the cab stand 
Shit, I'm about to whip it on you like the Dazz Band 
I'm lookin' at that pussy print, I call it cat scan 
These other bitches lookin' garbage like the trash can 
Wildin' for it, I fuck up a hundred thousand for it
I throw some money in the air, then hit the diving board
Bottles on the table, you could drink a fountain 
You a smoker, not a drinker, let's blow up a pound then 
Got some out of town friends, bring them bitches down then
Say you was gon' tear it down for me, tear it down then 
I been stackin' all my money, shit look like a mountain 
If you standin' in my circle, you in good surroundings
I don't fuck with stupid hoes, I let 'em do they clown dance 
If you make it clap for me, bitch, I'm pullin' out bands 


Fuckin' to some Chris Brown, king of R&B 
She want me to climb up in it like a tree 
Is that ass real or fake? I'ma find out 
She say she like it rough, I'ma pull her tracks out 
I might blow it all, baby, tell me what's the total? 
Ain't nothin' out my range, I get brain in the Rover 
You knew she was a diamond, shoulda kept her in the vault
Uncut, no soda, she want me to hit it raw
Got the Bentley dealership, if she want it, she can have it
Gon' drive it, baby, #RichNiggaChallenge 
Bust it wide open, baby, gon' bend it over 
Fuck me like you hate me, girl, that pussy bipolar


Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock-rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat

"The king of the jailhouse
And the queen of the road
Think sharing the burden will lighten the load
So they pack up their troubles
In an old Cadillac
That's her in the mirror, asleep in the back

Baby, there's something wrong with me
Baby, there's something wrong with me
Baby, there's something wrong with me
That I can't see
That I can't see

And they don't give the answers
At the end of the test
So you can't simply stand there and hope for the best
So wake me up at the border
When we reach Mexico
I'll tell you a secret I don't even know

Baby, there's something wrong with me
Baby, there's something wrong with me
Baby, there's something wrong with me
That I can't see

Honey, I don't wanna turn around
And go back there – do you?
I think you know something I don't know
That I need to

Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?


You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it


Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without


Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One


Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?


Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again


You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt


One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other

One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

I never meant to be unkind

You returned to me
But love's the last thing on my mind


Nothing in this world's invincible
No-one's heart is made of stone
And though I know I'm yours in principle
I'm the one thing you'll never own


If you can live your life without me
Turn and walk away
Minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to days
If you can't stand a single moment
Then go
But kiss me goodbye
Kiss me Kiss me Kiss me
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me goodbye

I never swore on oath for you
Did you expect the holy trinity
In all I say and all that I do?

But kiss me goodbye
Kiss me Kiss me Kiss me

It's not emotional extravagance
We've said farewell a thousand times
Why pretend there'll be a second chance
Unless this last kiss changes you mind?


If you can live your life without me

Actions speak louder than words
Get fucked up, sat on the kerb, street geezers

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say


I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you


Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy


Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, ""No"", labelled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that


I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets


If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

That will teach you to drive flash

Well you might have to sell your car
And your parent's brand new house
You lie awake and lose your sleep

Well you can have a brand new nose

Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot


People you've been before that you
Don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight
Except a loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer
So, baby tell me would it be all right
If we just take a little rain check and stay right here
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do
As a matter of fact, baby why don't you


Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there
Yeah, I can take it from there


I'm gonna put an old record on
Conway Twitty, yeah girl I'd love to lay you down
Kill the ringer on the telephone
Ain't gonna stop lovin' you 'til the candle burns out
Oh there it is, that little smile of yours
Come on, baby, what ya waiting for?


Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights

Let down your hair and I can take it from there


Tomorrow's gonna be here way too soon

You a what? Bad Boy Killaz

Hahaha, yeah, nigga, fuck 'em all!

Fuck all you muthafuckers!
Ayo, Biggie, put your hands up!


Now, I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to mothafuckers when they scrappin'
Blast and watch 'em back up
Notorious Biggie killer, affiliation with Death Row
Niggas get their caps pealed back, fool, this the West Coast
Bitch, you misdemeanor, I'm raisin' hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated, we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip ‘cause, bitch, I love to scrap
Mama raised me as a thug nigga, with love niggas
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines, writin' raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks
Now they all want to sue me, so fuck 'em all!



Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah



Now, could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak?
Even the baddest be gettin' murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets, like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison, wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell? A possibility of livin' well?
But if they killin' me, I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosin' to sell, I'd rather die and be deceased
World mob figure addicted to these fuckin' streets


Now, put your muthafuckin' hands up if you's a rider 
Niggas ain't killers so they hidin' 
Fuck 'em all, touch 'em all; that's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out, watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man, I'm as strong as this game, ya'll be knowin' my name
A young high strung thug nigga created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane, gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash
And my next piece of ass, so fuck 'em all!



Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah

I do my dirt all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homie to call me

Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you

Nigga, we Outlaw riders
Don't give a fuck if you love us, we thuggin'


I got glad bags with enemies, cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessy, so they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick 'em and holla
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For my profit pick my Glock up
I'm bustin' with self-defense, you see
Poppin' nobody got 'em, holla
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers, the S.W.A.T. team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy, why? ‘Cause they'll never stop us
I watched Arnold Schwarzenegger bust somebody in a movie
Now I want to do it too, ooh, ooh
Niggas is too through, true to the game
I claim Outlaw riders, we give a fuck what they try, I'm…


‘Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain?
Kick back, lil' nigga, and watch the game
Get your mob rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin', like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot, trust me


Even my hood call me ""baby Malcolm X""
With the TEC's, shower some slugs on 'em
I've got a brother, don't rest and he keeps some drugs on him
Always in grind mood, hustle to find food
Ever seen Faces of Death? That's what my 9 do


I keep my mind on my money, and my money on my mind
With my back against the wall, like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat, I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world, this guerilla team of mine
Screamin', ""Thug Life, bitch, fuck 'em all!"" and die for 'em
Even if the last nigga left I'ma ride for 'em
Feel me? Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'
""Fuck 'em all, let them die!"" – that's my slogan; fuck 'em all!



Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah

I do my dirt all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homie to call me

Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you

Living life at the speed of light leaves dark in your soul
When every minute's got a heart attack in it
It's time to leave it alone

We're down to the worm in the bottle
The chips and the salsa are gone
Now we know why J.T. sang ""Oh Mexico""
We're two days south of the border
Feeling too good to care why
These Mexican minutes get longer and longer
As the days goes by


We're dropping our worries
And pickin up Espanol
Down here the sunsets are red
The tequila is gold
Life is sublime here on Mexican time
They've got something we need to learn
If we don't show for a while
Don't be concerned


We're down to the worm in the bottle

Only sixty cents a minute
For his special brand of sinning

Though he does it for the money
He gets pleasure from hearing you scream

Anything you could do I could do better

Better than you better better than you

Lego! I was the man on guard yeah couldn't tell me nothing
Smooth operator mic check pushing buttons
Seeking fame I was insecure somebody love me
Going backwards in my life call me call me Benji Button
Seek what I want yes sir got to have it
I don't care who it belongs to baby I'm a grab it
Coveting another undercover it's a habit
Tragic how this envy can turn you to a savage
I can do anything better than you
I wish I had what you had just a measure would do
Come bite the fruit ya it's good sin severing you
And now your wife ain't good enough any new one would do
Or your car or your job yeah your life seem wack
If it is the good life you still wanna give it back
But envy is sin and it will take charge
So don't be blind to the key like your boy Ray Charles


Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
I can do anything better than you
Anything better any anything better
Anything better any anything better
Anything better any anything better
I can do anything better than you


Yeah, Tedashii, my verse is...
Yeah...
Look now I been doing this a lot lately some undercover hating
A brother progress I give no congratulations
Maybe it's because I want the spot God gave him
Supposed to make Him famous while I wanna defame men
Crazy compliments are hard for me to say
I can't stand the thought of someone else getting praise
Wanting all the glory for myself what a shame
In the end it's really in vain like heroin
Check who I'm addressing no Vera Wang buddy
I thought we was supposed to be the same team funny
The Pharisees said Jesus did the same thing
When He tried to point 'em to the Father
On the tree's where they hung Him
Mark fifteen ten, yeah, see the heart of that sin
Only way to beat it through repentance and confession
Men fight for your joy killing discontentment
If you be satisfied in the sufficiency
Of the Lord then you are loving the next man




They ain't heard my verse yet...
Let's just admit it.... I'm better... hahaha
Simply you having more than me just offends me
Sends me after that capital like the Shift key
I'm Nevada, Sin City in the state of envy
You get it right? Like the the Ne... Whatever
They trying to be rich less I'm richer than you
The fun in number 1 is the point that I'm up in front of 2
I hate it when praises go to another dude
I grind to the T  to stay in front of U 
They should of put me on we raw..
You feeling me though right? Okay
They should've put me on me raw for eons
I'mma need my compliments with E-S-T or E-R
It's best or better when it's prime time I'm Deion
That's why I get excited when I heard you slipping off
I'm a B alphabet but I ain't been alpha yet
Then I realized I had it all wrong like Malcolm X
My entire life is entitled tied up and tired
Trying to acquire these titles with a wire for something higher

I tried to stay on the straight and narrow
But I've walked a crooked path
And I've felt worthy of forgiveness
And deserving heaven's wrath
Right on the money and off by a mile
Ahead of my time and way out of style


But I'm hanging tough, I haven't had enough
I am not giving up on life or love


Well, I try to stay away from the bottle
But I've reached out for the glass
I try to pull back on the throttle
But I still run out of gas

Hung with the devil, don't nobody faint

And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did


I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light

The days I had your loving ways
They haunt me now
The wrongs I've done
Now I'm the fool
The lonely one
I stand here now
Feeling so outside
I stand here now
Feeling so outside
I ask you now
Heart open wide

Babe
Hey babydoll
Don't ever leave me no
You're the spark that starts it all
And you're what makes me tippy toe
Ooh babe
Hey babydoll
If I could hold you now
Take me in
Don't let us lose it all
Let's start again
Don't let us fall

I never thought you'd grow to be
So far away from me
I cheated you so bad
You've got every right to say
Just go away, you cannot stay
Am I too late to give
To be so sensitive
Let our love live oh babe
Other eyes have blinded me
Now I can see and I can see

Babe
Hey babydoll
Don't ever leave me no
You're the spark that starts it all
And you're what makes me tippy toe
Ooh babe
Hey babydoll
If I could hold you now
Take me in
Don't let us lose it all
Let's start again
Don't let us fall

If I could only say
How much I love you babe
I love to squeeze you so
Lord knows
Lord knows I'll appreciate
That love we left
That love so rare
Oh
My heart is out
My arms want only you
I've learned my lesson well
If I have lost that special part of me
I tell myself, and everybody
Take time
To love the one you love
Don't be like me oh no
Take the time
It takes to love
The one who really loves you yeah
Take time
To love the one you love
Or you might lose her now
Take the time it takes
To love the one
The one who really, really loves you
Don't be like me no, no
Take the tiem
To love and to love
Take the time it takes to love
The one who really, who really really loves you
I've learned my lesson well
I tell myself and everybody
Take the time it takes
To love the one
The one who really, who really really loves you yeah
Take time to love
The one who really loves you
Take the time it takes
To love the one
Who really really loves you
Don't be no fool babe
Hey baby doll
I don't wanna lose you baby
I don't wanna lose you baby

"How much fun
To be drifting along
With the weight of the sun on my head
Not covered in sad
As I sketch with my pen
And I brace for the troubles ahead
Slow
Like the weight of the bow
Takes you on as you pull the string back
Don't be fooled by the light
...
As your head opens into their time
You will pay
You will pay for your new soul
Down
Through a hole in the ground
Let the ferryman carry you back
To the winter queen's home
In the shadow abroad
Where you learn to become one of them and
You
... shoes
In the house of the dead
Makes the ferryman sigh
... in his eye
And he lets you return back to the time
You will pay
You will pay now that you came
You will pay
You will pay for your new soul

Going down the road that nobody knows where the truth might lie where within
And I might fall and I might fly, I might not know the reasons why

Time never cares, if you're there or not there
All you ever needed was a simple plan
But you're doing well, I mean you're not dead
So let's celebrate while we still can


I know what they say, I could give or care
They talk so much on me, I must be doing something right
I saw my son today, in the likeness of a full grown man
So I'll celebrate while I still can


Oh on a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the mother fucking house
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixing up the tree that farms move
I've came too far


How many others have walked the same ground you have
You will be wise to pay attention to your old head
I spent the whole day throwing records in the deep end
So lets celebrate while we still can


Captivated, the fruits of my family tree
Where would I be without you
What would you do without me
It would be a bad look talkin' bout what could've been
So lets celebrate while we still can


On a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't see the point
But now I'm at the point where I got it figured out
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixin' up the tree that farms move
I've came too far




Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand
What's mine is yours
I thought you knew me better than that
I was under the impression that we all want the best of life
So let's celebrate while we still can


The partnership of the, of the board and the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers
In the fluent directions with the, with this wave is what interests me
Now chaotic surfing, nervous surfing, and uh, surfing power has its, has its merits
And I, uh, I can—it fascinates me. That's just not my direction
I, I can only speak for myself

But somehow I get lost each time
Feeding this hunger deep inside that never ends
The voice within eats me up inside
One: I love hurting you
Two: I love your pain
Three: Let's get together and play this endless game
Four is for the torture and
Five is for the shame
'Cause every time you want it I get off on this game


You wanted to play, the coldness follows
This isn't a game, your life I'll swallow
And I can't help but smile at your pain
You wanted to play but I already won!


Probing, I plant the seed inside your head
Right away, watch it grow destroying your insides
Pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways
I watch the tears fall, I crack a smile

I've been slammed with some bad luck
Soon I'm gonna bring you doom with the buck, buck
And now you duck, duck, goose, I'm letting loose
With the 30-ought freestyle labeled hostile by my profile
Must be all the madness you and all your tactics
Jonesing for my cash got to make them pockets super fat
Hey I'm a humble man kicking out my jams like a tramp
I'm gonna stick it like a stamp to this business
What's with all the business?
I get paid to take the microphone and slay the stage
Stay away from all the bros in my band and all the fans
And all my friends when the cash is coming in
Or I'll be slamming them balls to the wall
With the ink on my flesh to the 'yes, yes y'all!'
No 9 to 5, I'll still survive
I keep my engine on that amp like a Chattanooga champ
That's all we need, another bad seed
Planted on this Earth motivated by greed


You wanna play that game bitch?

Stuck, got your brain on my green again!
Stuck, you're so, you're so, you're so stuck you don't even know!


All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi
Far from suicidal still I get them tendencies
Bringing back them memories
That I really miss when I reminisce
Rocking back in the 80s live my attitude to do or die
Once I was a maggot but now I'm just Super Fly
Bound for the boundaries, no limit G
Fat ass rhythms driven by my destiny
Your style's in my pocket
Proclaimed to regain that essence
Pressin 'cause I'm hostile labeled by my profile
Indeed I am, I am indeed hostile when it comes to greed

The crawling out, no easy task
And when the light goes out at last
I can tell but I can't see
The rabbit standing next to me


Next to me
Next to me
Next to me


I'm running out, but off the path
Frantically searching for my way back
And now I'm lost and losing hope
And feel the breathing of something close
I must escape, go far from this
But I'm traveling deep in a dark abyss
I can tell but I can't see
The rabbit standing next to me

Play your love songs all night long

And rest your head for just five minutes

The windows are illuminated by the evening
Sunshine through them, fiery gems

Yonder come Miss Rosie—how in the world do you know?
Well I know by the apron and the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder, piece of paper in her hand
Well I'm callin' that captain, he turn a-loose my man

Let the midnight special, shine her ever-lovin' light on me

You go and march to the table, you meet the same old thing
Knife and fork are on the table, ain't nothin' in my pan
And if you say anything about it, you have a trouble with the man

And you better not squabble, you better not fight

Yeah, this my only medicine right here
Huh, too real
This my lean, ya heard


Spit like this 'cause I scribe my own script
Rich on some project shit, I don't switch
Legit, though I dialogue slick, the God slick
Grown man shit, I'm on my own dick
Adored by the prettiest broads, I'm no fraud
The overlord, go overboard when I record
Shit facts, a billion stack, this is get back
Wrist wrap, suited up, no mismatch
Did me in B-more with Big B

Case closed, on the chase for pesos

Play slow, but about it, others doubt it
The hate, allowed it, off break was straight without it

Play who? Niggas smokin' that K2
Passed out, got clout they rap 'bout from the trap route

In the spot with two coke pots like kissin' cousins
Scratch that, too fly for flashbacks
Got my eyes on a G5 'craft, all matte black
More moola, dirt-bikes out in Dubai
And fuck 50 feet in the sky, I need a new high

They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand


And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please


As all good friends we talk all night

You know what gang violence is, mostly?

If somebody shoots your family member
Of course you retaliate, You know what I mean?
Same thing the U.S does except nobody even shot their family members
They see that, somebody bomb a school
And all these people get killed
So the united states feel like ooh thats messed up
We gotta go show em who tha real killers
This country was built on gangs, you know
I think this country still is run on gangs
Republicans, Democrats, The Police Department, The FBI
The CIA, those are gangs, you know what I mean
The correctional officers
I had a correctional officer tell me straight
""We the biggest gang in New York state
Straight up.""


Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack, to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas, now playa what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleeding with three strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hiding from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency in over time
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin, from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin five rounds
My forty-five got my fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when our Glock spits
All hail, Out on Bail, Wrath of the 2Pacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug Niggas never left the boot camp


We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, 2Pac is back
Where my soldiers is at? 
Where the fuck my soldiers at?
Where my soldiers is at?


Now I was born as a rebel, making trouble for the devil
Take this gang bang shit, to a whole nother level
Can you feel me now?
Armies in every city
Definition of power
Players are you with me?
See the war is the prophecy
Survival is the strategy
Rest in peace to my comrades that deceased




Walking down the streets of time
Youll have these devils petrified of a nigga in his right mind
They tell us that we hopeless and hell bound
This fo the brothers in penetentiaries jailed down
I got you in my heart till tha day I die
Think of tha damage we can do, if we wasn't high
Can you picture me loc? Its a thugs wrath
Political contracts and blood baths
For Matulu Shakur up in the Rikers
Though they got you, I never let them stop me
The struggle continues


Now if we do want to live a thug life and a gangsta life and all of that
Ok, so stop being cowards and lets have a revolution
But we dont wanna do that, dudes just wanna live of character
They wanna be cartoons, but if they really wanted to do something
If they was that tough, alright, lets start our own country
Lets start a revolution, lets get out of here, lets do something


We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, 2Pac is back

Distract the facts ma’am, that’s the plan now
Where you work, where you lurk, what you search
Climb too much get off of that perch
Virtual reality your nightmare
On the grid, kid, getting nowhere
Get ahead, leave behind
Lose your mind find in time
A nowhere rhyme


Chemicals up in the atmosphere
Another meteor is falling near
Buried in the headlines disappear
I’m not the type to live in fear
You dream but I know you’re awake
Explaining a nightmare you couldn’t shake
Maybe the kool-aid that you drank today


We’re breaking away from the past
Reaching a new plane at last
Regardless of what cards get played
No one can keep you afraid


Unless you wanna be
You make that choice indubitably
They wanna play my emotions
But I’m like the ocean
Too calm to get upset by somebody’s notion
Future makers
Organ takers
A non-human intelligence is guiding
Worlds colliding
Far away star system
I string DNA where I need ‘em


What we gonna get with a zero field
Gotta have the one to make it real
I tell ya that more will be revealed
The mystery don’t bother me
Everyday a masquerade
There’s always too many plans we laid
Keep going faster down the grade we made




We’re always beginning
As sure as we’re spinning
For it’s never ending from here
After all this time
I am sorry I’m not sorry
Hate me later
There's something greater
Than the petty here and now


Venture on
The sketch is not completely drawn
Travel wide
It’s not hiding inside
Venture on
The sketch is not completely drawn
Travel wide
Its out beyond the great divide

Seems like yesterday i would try to tell me friends that I was hot
I told my crew that I would be in the paper
Went from the paper to the news
And just sometime later

Hold me close, I am full of these fears

Ruby stay at home on a Friday night
Hoes blow up my phone, tell 'em that I'm quite alright
I might forget that my pimp game is weak sometimes
And if you slip you fall in love—now she's gone
Now I gotta ball, flex on Adderall
Sex on Tramadol, I guess I'll try 'em all
As I recollect, the records I collect
Most of the artists wished for an early death
I will give it my all, yes, I will give it my best
Anything to replace all the static in my chest
But I know she won't be home, I feel so fucking broke
I'm lethal, I bleed foam, and seep smoke


Tryna join the 27 Club
So many times tried to get off the subs
Yung Inebriated, Lil Half Cut
Both knees are shaking from the mass drugs
I put in my body every day, daily
Ex on my mind when I start masturbating
Somebody save me, 'cause I have no patience
When it comes to death, I'm not tryna be waiting
Not tryna be slaving for no vacation
Not tryna be you, or that bitch that you're datin', save all the faking

In between if I'ma fold or blow up, $uicide is what I'm choosing

Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around, when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud, creatures baying

All I've ever done is hide
From our times, when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life


But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to


It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good

Now at last, the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against, your body's borders

I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh someday
Our baby and her momma, and the damaged love she made


But I don't know what else that I would do
Than to try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the god that heroin prays to

My eyes had been looking for you
All over everywhere
Over low roads, down highways, and bald deserts
You know the night
You know the night
Your eyes had this same shine about 'em, I noticed
And when I first looked through the wild, wayward mist
I felt such a warm friendly, cool sunny smile
That I wanted to look in your eyes for all time

When you feel like the angels are curling your hair
And you feel like the devil is scratching your heel

And you feel like the devil is scratching your heel

You know the night I first met you
Did you look at me and think
Here's this guy who hopes like I hope
And sees the same kind of dreams I see
'Cause you wondered, I know
If your hopes could find shape
In the words that we used there to work back the fog
Your hopes and your plans for the good of the people
Could all of your hundred and one
Dreams just as bright as the sun
And all your wants and your hottest desires
Find shape in the flow of my talk?
You know the night
You know the night
And if my jellied brain turns to ashes and sand
There will still be such night smiles across all the land
There will still be such faces meeting here in the dark
And there around the corner, or maybe in the park
It's when we meet this way and we look at each other
We get a hold of our scattered aims and we bring em'
And beat them and wrestle and fight them and heat them
And beat them and weld them together
Like iron from the valley and fire from the sky
Like iron from the valley and fire from the sky
Like iron from the valley and fire from the sky
This blast furnace heat burns in our people's eyes

So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender

"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Ah, ah, ah!""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go ""Ah, ah, ah!""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane, comes a rainbow

Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

I am just an aging drummer boy
And in the wars I used to play
And I've called a tune
To many a torture session
Now they say I am a war criminal
And I'm fading away

I have legalized robbery
Called it belief
I have a-run with the money
And hid like a thief
Re-written history
With my armies and my crooks
Invented memories
I did burn all the books

And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song

The man's too strong



Well I've tried to be meek
I have tried to be mild
But I spat like a woman
And I sulked like a child
I have lived behind walls
That have made me alone
Striven for peace
Which I never have known

And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song

The man's too big
The man's too strong

And they all did hear him say:
""You always was a Judas
But I got you anyway
You may have got your silver
But I swear upon my life
Your sister gave me diamonds
And I gave them to your wife""
Oh, father please help me

With an open container from 7-11
In St. Ides heaven


I've been out haunting the neighborhood
And everybody can see I'm no good
When I'm walking out between parked cars
With my head full of stars


High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone

That I want those things you could never allow
You see me smiling, you think it's a frown
Turned upside down

And they all got to say what you should and shouldn't do
Though they don't have a clue

Feeling down like him
Seeing the light in a station bar
And travelling far in sin
Sailing downstairs to the northern line
Watching the shine of the shoes
Hearing the trials of the people there

Take a look, you may see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town


Dancing a jig in a church with chimes
A sign of the times today
Hearing no bell from the steeple tall
People all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon
Making the moon for fun
Changing a robe for a size too small
People all get hung

Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom

Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?


When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies

Give me more wine

Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G


And I'll be stayin' strapped
My Mac-11 make my nuts bigger
I keep my finger on the trigger for you jealous niggas
Wonder why a motherfuckers nutty, and why I'm up worried
When I see a cemetery full of dead buddies
Mama told me ""son, don't lie""
And Mama's in the back smokin' crack and a nigga wanna die
Can't cry cause I'm loc'd up
Choked up, nigga puffing on that indo getting fucked up
And in the back of my mind, I know I'm wrong
Alcohol make a young motherfucker think he ballin'
Collect calls to my old bitches, send more pictures
On the phone, tryin' to bone cause I miss ya
Back on the streets I'm losin' focus
I'm hopeless, homies dyin' over small time dope shit
Keep my finger on my Mac man
The crack game ain't shit
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G

Even when I die, they won't worry me

So you wanna make a million?
And motherfuckers catchin' drug cases
I place my Glock outside my waist and keep a thug face
Even on a good day!, gotta stay strapped
Livin' in my hood, hey!
Niggas will spray caps
And everybody wanna go to heaven, don't nobody wanna pray
So I stay clutchin' on my AK
Murderin' niggas that oppose me
That's how it goes, you motherfuckers try to play me and the homies
Time to make my get-away
I hid away in the backstreets
Couldn't let the police jack me
Gotta be quiet, I'm on the down low
I got that ya-yo movin' by the pound so
When the police try me out, fuck the judge
Got a homie that'll bond me out, straight love
Keep my finger on my Mac man
The crack game ain't shit
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G


I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me

Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G


Stuck on fool, Tanqueray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I lead a Thug Life, heartless hustler
Just cause I fucked, don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibratin', can't sleep
So I'm mobbin' to the ho's house, bumpin' Isley
""Is it cool to fuck?"" That's what I'm askin'
Bitch recognized game and started laughin'
Now I'm all in the guts and shit
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
Cause I'll fuck and get up, I'll let you know
I'll be a 10 minute brother for a $2 ho
Lots of hoes gettin' mad as shit
I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
Keep my finger on my Mac man

I often wonder why I sit and wait to die
What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning...
""How and why""?


I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end
An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why!
I was a boy who had to live his own way
I never fit into the model they had designed
I chose a path less taken
I stood with others who had often felt the same
We got stares from passersby
Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away
And when the three young boys died
They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!
No hope in sight


I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!


Why was everybody so damn afraid?
They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime
And to justify their own faith
We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time
The three of us were attacked and disgraced
For many hours we were questioned and someone lied
One of us couldn't take it
His simple manner was manipulated in kind
Fear made him lie




Now I am terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!
And why?
Can't anybody see through their disguise?!
Only believe we didn't take their lives!
And now the three of us have lost our lives

"Suzanne takes you down
To her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night
There forever
And you know that she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
She feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And when you wanna tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
You've always been her lover

And you wanna travel with her
Ah, but you wanna travel blind
And you think maybe you trust her
For you've touched
Your perfect body with her mind

Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
He spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
That only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men shall be brothers
Then, until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken and almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

But you wanna travel with him
But you wanna travel blind
And you think maybe you trust him
For he's touched

Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion


A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion


Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky


Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion


Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky


Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion


Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky 
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky 
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky 
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me

We're fucking up your city and we're fucking up your program
Fucking all your bitches we can fucking give a goddamn

We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fucking planet before the time I'm through

So let me get what I got coming and the rest I'm taking

Been shining like a diamond but getting passed as coal

So blow me bitch I don't rock for *cancer*
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection, this much is true
We do what we say, you say what we do
Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get too much P to ever *be no homo*

I'm an easy rider dreaming of Winona
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Caray couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck Off

Who hate the world just as much as each other
And I ain't leavin' this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancing around drunk touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do shrooms you all better give me two rooms
Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block, you better lock your cars
Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules

She seemed so right, nothing wrong
Everything about her was so strong
So I waited for the magic to start
Somebody touch me deep in my heart

Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, ""Hold on
You're not the only one""
And so I said, ""You're wrong Yvonne""

When I saw her again, I was caught in a landslide
But I didn't dare let it show
Her ruby lips were teasing me
But jealousy would never let us be
So I waited for the magic to start
But I know it's gonna tear us apart

Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, ""Hold on
You're not the only one""
And so I said, ""You're wrong Yvonne""

She'll never know how much I loved her
I never got to tell
We never had the chance to say farewell

When I last saw Yvonne
She was covered in roses
But the laughter had gone from her eyes
She walked so tall, looked so grand
Everything about her truly planned
But what you get is not what you see
""So long Yvonne you're not fooling me""

Yvonne's the one I've been counting on
She said, ""Hold on, you're not the only one""
And so I said, ""So long Yvonne""

I had to look through our old pictures
To see the way we used to smile
Before we left love in the closet
Like it just went out of style
Can we pull out those old feelings
Wipe the hurt away like dust
Make love shine the way it used to shine
Find the gold beneath the rust


That's all I need to know
Do you want to stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holding on forever
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know


Is it too late to recover
Those old smiles we used to wear
Can we save a love that once was strong
Before it breaks beyond repair




Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know

I shaved my face and combed my hair
Put on a new pair of underwear
Sat on the porch with my labrador
Like a hundred other times before
She changed her shoes and freshened up her face
Put on some skimpy, sexy lace
Finally made her way through the back screen door
We loaded up on the front seat of my Ford


And we went out to dinner and we drove right back home
Watched an old movie and drank a half a bottle of rum
And then we turned off the TV and we got right down to it
There ain't nothing left to do now that we've done it


Seems like it happens every time
We get a chance to reignite that fire
We burn it fast and then retire
Just before the news on channel 5




After all these years, it can get routine
You change the order up, or use different names
Try it in the morning, or the middle of the day
The end results are still the same




Oh Lord we turned off the TV and we got right down to it
There ain't nothing left to do now that we've done it
Hey honey, hand me that remote

Oh, my God, I'm such a terrible mess
I'm turned on by the tabloids, you would never have guessed
That I'm a sucker for their gossip, man, I take it too far
I bottle up my Hollywood, and watch 'em name their kids after cars


I'm finding me out
I'm having my doubts
I'm losing the best of me


We're all part of the same sick little games
And I need a get-away, get-away
I'm wasting my days, I throw them away
Losing it all on these sick little games


I fell in love, she was the friend of a sister
Of somebody famous - at least for a day
Expensive habits and a taste for the town
Had me chasing down red carpets
And watching all my friends slip away


They're finding me out
I'm having my doubts
I'm losing the best of me
Dressed up as myself
To live in the shadow
Of who I'm supposed to be


We're all part of the same sick little games
And I need a get-away, get-away
I'm wasting my days, I throw them away
Losing it all on these sick little games


If I play my cards right
I can make the big time
I could be a reason to stare
Caught up in the spotlight
Shaking from the stage fright
How did I end up here?


We're all part of the same sick little games
And I need a get-away, get-away
We're all part of the same sick little games
And I need a get-away, get-away

"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixon

But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
Hey, Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee:
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!

To a house down a one way street
Say you're gonna lock up all the doors
And throw away the key

Oh, but don't burn down the bridge, darlin'
You just might wanna come back
'Cause the grass ain't no greener
On the other side of the track

Oh, you counted me out, before I could get to bat
All the things are out-ta the Chevrolet
Tomorrow night be drivin' a Cadillac

But don't burn down the bridge, darlin'
You just might wanna come back

Hey!

All your so called friends
Taught you how to cheat an' lie
Now it seem like you gonna jump
From the fryin' pan to the fire

Thunder roared
And all the future that I counted on
In a moment
It had come and gone

By the time I could turn around
You were gone
And I was all alone
Sort of like the comet beyond the star
You brought me so close to heaven

I was so high off of the ground
So close to heaven
And I think I may never come down

Nature laughed
I discovered you
Someone I could tell my troubles to
Guess I learned some thing I never knew
You brought me so close to heaven

I was so high off of the ground
So close, so close
And I think I may never come down
So close to heaven

Your life is ending one minute at a time
Check the clock and stand in line
Hibernate till your, till your life's passed you by
Please stop living like you're waiting to die


Keep up, keep up, don't get left behind
Don't slip up, slip up, chase that finish line
They don't want you believing
That your life deserves a meaning


Weary souls, trying to forget
That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt


What a feeling, built to break
Happiness with an expiry date
Please stop living like you're waiting to die
Please stop living like you're waiting to die


Stitched into our lives, drained until we expire
Weary souls trying to forget
That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt
We're all weary souls, trying to forget


Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line
In this race, we're all reduced to vermin
Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line

As I'm strolling down the block with really nothing on my mind
Laid back and I'm just thinking of old times
Pop in a Isley Brothers tape and I'm maxing
Peeping through my side view, checking out my waxing
Hey, I gotta say
Today's a good day for me to live around the way 
Time to hit the 6-4
And pump the bass at 'em just to let 'em know
Aaliyah's in the house, so I think you'd better check my flow

Booty calls are creeping, fellas on the corner peeping

And so I pick up my girls and hit the strip just because
Jazz array hey, it's Saturday and
The sun is blazing, it's so amazing
And if you are a YNP
And you're rolling with the BGE
Congratulations
I know I got the skills to make you trip
R Kelly's flipping tracks, so grab a hold and don't you slip
The negative young nation that steps to me gets dealt with
So raise your hands if you're sure
Are you a young nation?

Stop to get some dressing, to the mall I'm flexing
You know to get them funky croaka-sacks
Tonight I'm hitting the town, ain't holding nothing back
Hey, well alright
Tonight is the night
Well I'm in the mood for celebration
Or even some jazzy conversation

I'm always screaming my lungs out 'til my head starts spinning
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
I'm constant like the seasons
And I will never be forgotten man


Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?


All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low


Still got something left to prove
It tends to keep things movin' while everyone around me says
My last days are looming overhead
But just what the hell do they think they know?
I keep my head above the water, while they drown in the undertow


Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?


All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low


If you take it from me, live your life for yourself
Cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else
C'mon!


So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me was this all worth it?
I get what I want so everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me


All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low


Keep your heads down low, keep your heads down low

Ah-all I ever wanted


Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close 
I was afraid to leave you on your own


I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck ’em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me


Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin’ so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 


Gave love ’bout a hundred tries 
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made ’em mine 
I didn't notice ’cause my love was blind


I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet

Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah


I'm sad inside, but I know it's for the best, right?
You had to realize where you drew the line
I would cross the line a thousand times
You've got what I need, bae, I need your spotlight
Along the lines of social suicide, I refuse to die not by your side
So I'll take what I can from you, then I'll hide
And save the ""Lucid Dreams"" for another time
I still hate it when you're not there
I know I should, I know I should, but no, I don't care
I still hate it when you're not there
This life's not fair, took advantage of that


Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?

What will we do without out blame

I played under the sun
Come to me come, into my dreams:
This is my light of life

Between the bluebells
Sits a girl with blond braids
A blue-eyed angel
With strawberry cheeks
The spell has bound me
I was living a dream
Norwegian homeland
My heart belongs to you

The spell has bound me
I was living a dream

My heart belongs to you

I climbed mountains so high
I discovered the deep
Long to be, long to be part of this dream:
This is where my heart beats

I die for you on my terms
When I get my lessons learned
Apples, cherries, pain
Breathe in, breathe out, pain

How come?


The more you have the more that people want from you
The more you burn away the more the people earn from you
The more you pull away the more that they depend on you
I've never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi
So I wonder if your needs are even meant for me
I wonder if you think that I could never raise you up
I wonder if you think that I could never help you fly
Never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi
But I'd save a life if I thought it belonged to you

If you'd have just told me I'd be home with you

When I visualise
All I see is black 
Ground me to the floor just a little more 
I know I've been gone
You've been all alone
Stoking up the fire for you
Set the place alight
Call me late at night
And I'll be running home to you


I, didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me I'd be home with you
I, didn't know that you were lonely

You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that?


Now you're missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know


Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned and run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero

That’s how many fucks I give, oh


Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good, get up and you could
Go out, free our minds
Like you never would, never understood

Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds, zeros, zeros

The minute my eyes open in the morning
Out on some highway, or pulling in the driveway
Clear blue sky or when it's thunder storming
My mind just can't escape you
The first time I touched you, that's when I knew


I want you trust me, I want you to love me
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about
All it ever comes down to, girl I just want you


When you get rattled, or you're coming all unraveled
When your holding everything together for me
The way you revealed me, the way that you feel me
The way you know I'm holding something inside
Don't know what time has for us
But as long as I'm here, one thing I'm sure of

Trust me I adore you
We’re swimming through our dreams
Kiss me in the shower
For a couple hours
Though we’re only sixteen
And sit down beside me
Don’t call me daddy
Cause that’s just fucking weird
Promise that you'll stay here
You and I can lay here
Until the end of time


But girl, well don't you worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely 
Girl, don't worry about me
But if you’re ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, I must let you go
Let you go


Baby, now it’s best here, to lay me down and rest here
Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do and I will watch right over you
With your heart, I’ll never toy
And you’re the other half of me
Drink and sleep and laugh with me
Save me from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see your face
You saved me from myself

Cause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely

They are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me
When I thought that I just can't go on

And they brought me their comfort
And later they brought me this song
Oh, I hope you run into them
You, who've been traveling so long

Yes, you who must leave everything
That you cannot control
It begins with your family
But soon it comes around to your soul

Well, I've been where you're hanging
And I think, I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy
Your loneliness says, that you've sinned

Well, they lay down beside me
I made my confessions to them
They touched both my eyes
And I touched the dew on their hem

If your life is a leaf
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love
That is graceful and green as a stem

When I left they were sleeping
And I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon

And you won't make me jealous
If I find that they've sweetened your night

And besides it would still be all right

Hey, up in the backwoods, down in the holler
Old boys feeling like a dog on a collar
Keeping that chain pulled tight
Waiting on Saturday night
Put on the smell-good, put on Skynard
Head into to town like a NASCAR winner
Cruising back an' forth to the Tasty-Freeze
Everywhere you look, all you see


Is hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirring it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little home grown
A country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly deluxe


Yeah, couple cute sweet things driving a fastback
Shoot 'em a cool smile hoping that they smile back
""Hey, Baby, what's you name?""
Burn a little rubber when the red lights change
Here come the blue lights, here come Barney
Hide all the beer, y'all, let's move the party
Gotta go, but that's all right
Do it all again next Friday night


Hillbilly Deluxe, slick pick-em-up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirring it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little homegrown
A country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly Deluxe

"I'm floating in a black balloon
O.D. on Easter afternoon
My mama told me ""Baby stay clean
There's no in-between""
And all you ladies and you gentlemen
Between is all you've ever seen or been
Fit poorly and arrange the sight
Doll it up in virgin white
You disappoint me, you people raking in on the world
The devil's script sells you the heart of a blackbird

Shine on me baby, because it's raining in my heart

Sun's rising on a chopping glare
Rain dropping acid bought up in the air
A distorted reality is now a necessity to be free
It's so disappointing
First I put it all down to luck
God knows why my country don't give a fuck
Fuck

Shine on me baby, because it's raining in my heart

Birds are leaving over autumn's ending
One of us will die inside these arms


Eyes wide open

One will spread our ashes 'round the yard


She says, ""If I leave before you, darling
Don't you waste me in the ground""

Couldn't tie you if I tried

Brings a pain I just can't hide

Honey, you can do it too

Yes, that's my problem
I can't tell
When I'm not being real
In the meadow dusk
I park my Aerostar
With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you


I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright


I see your curves and
I feel your vibrations
You dressed in black and white you lost in the mall
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations
Another sleepless night a sun that won't fall


I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright


Now the night is gone a new day is dawning
And our homeless dreams go back to the street
Another time or place another civilization
Would really make this life feel so complete


I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright

I have this new project coming out along with some other brothers called ""One Nation""
It's like an East Coast/West Coast collaboration
To kill this whole new vibe everybody want to be on about it
Like a war between the East Coast and the West Coast
The East Coast West Coast thing is something that
The journalists and People are making up just to get paid and so it can drag out MTV music awards


Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained and, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin' in the cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, everybody's bitchin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight


All my niggas on the East Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the West Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the East Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the West Side
Throw your guns up


Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert E's make MC's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apologizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
Realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
Our beef is my fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics




Niggas ain't shit in the 90's, I don't trust 'em
And bitches on my dick but they ain't shit, so motherfuck 'em
Eazy know's what's up cause see he really don't give a fuck
Cause it don't concern me if don't pertain to money or a nut
But then again I talk to a few of my friends
Nine times out of ten 'bout some ends or some skins
Cause I'm the type of nigga that gotta have it like a rabbit
Rappin' is my hustle bustin' ho's is a habbit
I stab it like a true no good nigga should
I do it the way a down O.G. nigga would
And now Niggas know Eric Wright ain't no busta
Another platinum cut from the Compton thugsta
My name is




The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggas talk but they babble cause they ain't sayin nuttin
If ain't blazin somethin with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My tech and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bills
We blessed with the will to never surrender
Cause my every agenda's in and out, unseen like I entered the ninja
It's my world


All my niggas on the East Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the West Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the East Side
Throw up ya guns
All my niggas on the West Side
Throw your guns up

Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up

I was jumping in the fire to the frying pan

She looked good in the window
She looked good in the window
I tried to make her fit but she just wasn't it
But for me the girl was all wrong

She looked good in the window
She looked good in the window
I tried to make her fit but she just wasn't it
But for me the girl was all wrong

I never had a chance with this man-eating girl
She tore my heart from my chest and fed it to the world
I was out of touch with reality
I couldn't figure out what she had done to me

Well I was mesmerized, hypnotized
She completely fooled me with her master disguise
How could I let myself get burned again
I guess that's the way it goes when fools rush in

She looked good in the window
She looked good in the window
I tried to make her fit but she just wasn't it
But for me the girl was all wrong

She looked good in the window
She looked good in the window
I tried to make her fit but she just wasn't it
But for me the girl was all wrong
All wrong

She looked good, ooh

She knocks me off my feet
She got me so messed up, I can't sleep
She got me hopeless with fever
She's a necessary evil

And I'd run if I could
I know she's bad
But it feels so good
Oh, it feels so good

She looked good in the window
She looked good in the window
I tried to make her fit but she just wasn't it
But for me the girl was all wrong

She looked good in the window
She looked good in the window
I tried to make her fit but she just wasn't it

Just a little ways with me
And as we walked and we would talk
All about our weddingday

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity.""

I took her by her golden curls
I drug her down to the river-side
An I there threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

And going home between twelve and one
I cried ""Lord, what have I've done?""
I've killed the girl I love
Because she would not marry me

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow

The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore


And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, cause Mama tried


Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused


And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried

Yall then the grocery store came next and then the bank


And it burns oh it burns, it burns

I dream and see you floating high above me
And I awake at dawn
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
From on the bedroom floor
I watch you sailing far above the seashore
In deep Atlantic skies
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
Above the avenue
I search among the clouds, trying to see you
But you are just a blur
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor

Overhead in the airway

Suspended in the air

When I am on the beach
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach
But I can not take flight
Or float upon the air the way that you might
When I am in the sea

I'll always be strong, my character defines me
I will never be that hateful and throw stones behind me
Temptation and ego can get you so wrong
A lot of people easily forget where they're comin' from


I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure


Hours upon hours searching for a better way out
And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers
Still just gotta look out
Jah is my guide, I know I'm here for a reason
Put my trust in the Most High
And my prayers are so consistent, ah
Who would've thought it would be like this today?
Nothing but prayers lift up your head
Lion in the jungle, I tell ya
He who have been blessed...


Welcome to Grateful
Strength is strength, strength is strength
You realize and appreciate your blessings
Embrace your blessings from the heart
To express your gratitude by doing righteous deeds
Asahd, my son - I love you
Thank you God
I also want to thank all my enemies, for turning they backs on me
Thank you, I'm so...


I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure
Hours upon hours, searching for a better way out

I, still got it, my nigga
Don't worry 'bout me, nigga
Never worry 'bout these niggas
Skill level on fleek, nigga
Out in South Beach where the weed
I came up that's how it seem
Shout out my big brother king


Tiller quit playing boy, you got this
Turn up on these niggas, make the knob twist
You know I've been going through a lot of shit
I gotta start thinking 'bout the positives
Came up on a check, I take it to the bank, deposit it
She hate when she tell me one thing and I do the opposite
That's just how I be when I be thinking 'bout the guap and shit
Like I give a fuck 'bout a hater hypothesis
If you putting money up, put your bands on him
That's your best bet, cause the man gon' win
If shit get outta hand, I put my hands on him
Damn, Tiller you went Super Saiyan on them
I'm about that action, put the cam on him
True, nigga all hell broke loose
Live from the motherfuckin' L-O-U
Doing numbers, getting numbers in my cell phone, too
Like viewer discretion
Come through with a weapon
My crew is the shit and your newest sewer the essence
I blew through the finish, ooh but you was in second
I'd do a song or two with you if you was impressive
Cut you a deal on it if that's what you were suggesting
You getting me too congested, I think I need Mucinex
Cause you sicken me, like ""Can I get a freebie?""
Are you kidding me?
I gave your bitch a third of my dick, she want the trilogy
She feeling me
Never met nobody real as me
That's cause most of these niggas weak
Keep the shade coming, boy, you never offending me
And you better watch your bitch, cause yo that's my way of getting even
I call it tricking season, I ball like Reggie Miller
Never been a petty nigga, don't say that for any reason
Nigga it's go time, been that the whole time
Really speaking, and niggas know I did it in no time, ay
I did it in no time ay
Trap$oul on the motherfuckin' way...
I gotta go on the motherfuckin' way
Lexington I'm on my motherfuckin' way
Young Tiller




Molly
I got the trap, and the soul
I ain't just R&B, no no
Word
The sound fresh to death like so-so
Bitch I'm bound to get- bound to get next
So here we go, here we go!


I'm a young boy coming out the 'Ville 
This shit still don't seem real 
If I don't do it nigga, tell me who will 
Young Tiller ball like Lucille 
Young Tiller keep it too trill
Went from Papa Johns, to popping up in your city
Now I got a piece of mind, I gotta keep a new bitch equipped
She from the islands
Trench coat mobbin', she want me to holler
I can't help it that I'm modest
And why these niggas lying? You just act like an Impala
When you should be more like nada
Yo, seriously, don't!
Versace my cologne, my city I put on
I did it on my own, bitch I'm more than just one song
Call me what you want, just don't call when I'm in my zone
Gotta put my phone on Airplane mode
All my niggas share they hoes, but I'm so stingy with bitches
Big bank in my britches, lit dank in my swisher
Get faded no clippers, I hang with them hipsters
Don't you compare me with any of these niggas

"Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come to the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

We are flying on wings in winter sky with fire burning deep inside
We are warriors of endless time forever and on
On wings of steel an ancient flight we see the powers that unite
The gods will now send us a sign of battle once more

Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar
Where the fights will be raging for now and for more
When united we come and divided they fall
Tonight you will witness it all

Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come to the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

A land unknown we come so far
We ride the night till morning star
When colors fade to black and white
Your eyes come to sight

With the vision of a great divide
You turn towards the other side
You think you run but you can't hide
The dead can not ride

Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar
Where the fights will be raging for now and for more
When united we come and divided they fall
Tonight you will witness it all

Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come to the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

Over high seas and mountains
We fly to the heavens on wings of a dragon tonight

Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky

Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come to the land of the sun

The heart of a dragon

Dammi del tu...
Lui si è perso nei suoi occhi blu
Stringiti forte
Forte, forte
E' un giorno nuovo per noi
Guarda quelli non ridono più
Dillo agli amici tuoi
Che d'ora in poi
Tu sei per me
Quando ci si vuol bene
Si è sempre soli fra tanta gente
Quando la gente è sola
Si trova bene insieme a noi...

Di tornare tutti a casa

L'ho lasciata per poco

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true?
That I get a kick out of you
Some people go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Still I get a kick out of you


I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me, aww


I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Still I get a kick out of you
Yes I get a kick out of you

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire


I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire


The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild


I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park


When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark


Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there




Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?


Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you


Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there


Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?


And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there


Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there




Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark


Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind


Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind


Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Legs are tired, these hands are broken
Alone I try with words unspoken
Silent cry, my breath is frozen
With blinded eyes, I fear myself

When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall the legends rise


My throat is dry, my vision's fading
I'm paralyzed and left here waiting
Taking time just one step forward
Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay


It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall the legends rise

"Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Alone at night in the cold and windy city
When the candle fades away
Another morning and the sun's shining pretty
You can watch the children play


But there's a hole in the sky, and it cries for you and I
And we can't find the reason for calling
There's a new place to see another world for you and me
And one can hear the bell which will be tolling, tolling


They crossed the line
See the light, it shines
They crossed the line
Heaven or Hell, who will decide?


What's coming after the curse of wrath and agony
Oh Lord, please help us find our way
We tried to get out of the last light of eternity
But we couldn't get away


But there's a hole in the sky, and it cries for you and I
And we can't find the reason for dreaming
But there's a new place to see another world for you and me
And one can hear the bell which will be tolling

See the light, it shines

Ooh, ooh, they crossed the line
They crossed the line
Touching the heaven, burning in Hell
Cast away, cast away, cast away the spell

Every day's a killing time
Sun coming up outside
No men are born this time
Saturday's child stays home
Nothing to say so long
Well well well another day
Well well well another day

Grocery store ten bucks
Just making change for plastic cherries
Up in a tree a Jay Bird looking at me
No word
Everyone looks but can't see
We can't be ignored easily
Well well well another day
Well well well another day

Soft within the wayward things
Like ecstasy, the sound of trees
Most anything, what a baby sees

Beautiful face all right
Many a place out of sight
Old woman there with red shoes
A million balloons all hues
Drive over hills forget your fear
Getting it out of second gear
Well well well another day
Well well well another day

Unconditional love 
Talkin' about the stuff that don't wear off, it don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days, these crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
A motherfucker still love you, still feel you
Still there for you, no matter what 
You will always be in my heart with unconditional love


Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doin' years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God?
So we must ask forgiveness
Ask Mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears fallin' free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room 
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama, don't cry, long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don’t need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fightin' and the hurtin'
In my room cryin' because I didn't wanna be a burden
Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love


In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love


Just got the message, you've been callin' all week
Been out here hustlin' on these streets
Ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's all G
We could never be enemies
'Cause you've been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs?
No wonder why when times get hard
'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make G's eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
We work somethin' out of nothin'
No pleasure in the sufferin'
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'
The liquor and the weed, the cussin'
Sendin' love out to my block
The struggle never stops 


In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love


I'll probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin' to change your ways
While gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin' inside, please let me die, these are strange times
How come I never made it?
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures
And all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter
Hopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night
Baby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier 
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love

 
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark

What a joy it is to stand in Christ forgiven
Righteousness and eternal life when salvation is given
All my sins paid for and I could never repay You
But now my greatest delight is to trust You and obey You
More than a genre of music, worship is a heart change
I gladly bow my knee to the God who never changes
Every day I'm changing, becoming more like Christ
Adoring what is good, adorned with the fruits of new life
And my hope is not a fantasy, it's built upon a reality
That you will keep Your promises according to Your sovereignty
I will see Your face and be safe under Your reign
When my faith turns to sight and only perfect love remains
Your people are my people no matter where they come from
The church exists according to the works of God's Son
So in the New Creation when we're gathered in His name
It will be obvious that He's the one that's worthy of all fame
Cause the worthiness of Jesus is the reason we belong
So ""Worthy is the Lamb"" will forever be our song


Wisdom, Power, and Praise
Glory, Honor, and Strength
Worthy!
To the Lamb who was slain
Be Wisdom, Power, and Praise
Forever!
And to the King on the throne
Be Glory, Honor, and Strength
You are worthy!


There is a space between us, it's a right divide
Distance between the depths of Your worthiness and mine
Mine is derivative, all my worth comes from Thine
I am merely a man, all Thy works divine
I abide only as a branch attached to the vine
That grows the beautiful fruit that gets crushed into wine
I am the least deserving made worthy to touch His feet
The servant that did nothing to earn a seat at the wedding feast
I'm a created being, You created everything
You make footstools of fools and galaxies Your rings
You are Christ the Consummate, my hope and every confidence
Worthy to receive praise from every mouth and every continent
Infinitely worthy of loyalty and my allegiance
Worthy enough to die to self, to offer my obedience
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Son of Man
Worthy is the One who takes the scrolls from His holy hand
Where angels and elders and living creatures all fall
And worship the highest King, the most worthy of all


Wisdom, Power, and Praise
Glory, Honor, and Strength
Worthy!
To the Lamb who was slain
Be Wisdom, Power, and Praise
Forever!
And to the King on the throne
Be Glory, Honor, and Strength

I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you
And then you met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too

You looked at her, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talking to


I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
Because I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on her shoulder
You smiled at her, she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me

Your vest ain't gon' work if you're hit with the K

From the top to the bottom 
At the core, I've forgotten 
Taken far from my safety 
The sun will escape me 

From the top to the bottom 
At the core, I've forgotten 
Taken far from my safety 
The sun will escape me 


From the thread to the needle, middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion

Then with the eyes tightly shut
Looking through the rust and rot and dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours itself upon the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again


From the top to the bottom 
At the core, I've forgotten 
Taken far from my safety 
The sun will escape me 

From the top to the bottom 
At the core, I've forgotten 
Taken far from my safety 
The sun will escape me 


In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up


Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, cars, chain-link, and concrete

A window then grows and catches the eye
Cries out a yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top

Nothing stops in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And then the insides change, the box stays the same
The shame, shovel up the pieces of the pain
You can try to hide yourself in this world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again


From the top to the bottom 
At the core, I've forgotten 
Taken far from my safety 
The sun will escape me 

From the top to the bottom 
At the core, I've forgotten 
Taken far from my safety 
The sun will escape me 


In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forgive me
But the lies have piled up


Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

Now I got you caught in the act, you better step back

What is this land America so many travel there
I'm going now while I'm still young my darling meet me there
Wish me luck my lovely I'll send for you when I can
And we'll make our home in the American land
Over there all the woman wear silk and satin to their knees
And children dear, the sweets, I hear, are growing on the trees
Gold comes rushing out the rivers straight into your hands
When you make your home in the American Land


There's diamonds in the sidewalk the's gutters lined in song
Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who will make his home in the American Land


I docked at Ellis Island in a city of light and spires
She met me in the valley of red-hot steel and fire
We made the steel that built the cities with our sweat and two hands
And we made our home in the American Land


There's diamonds in the sidewalk the's gutters lined in song
Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who will make his home in the American Land


The McNicholas, the Polanski's, the Smiths, Zerillis, too
The Blacks, the Irish, Italians, the Germans and the Jews
Come across the water a thousand miles from home
With nothing in their bellies but the fire down below
They died building the railroads worked to bones and skin
They died in the fields and factories names scattered in the wind
They died to get here a hundred years ago they're still dying now
The hands that built the country were always trying to keep down


There's diamonds in the sidewalk the's gutters lined in song
Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who will make his home in the American Land

Whoever thought that that sweet thing born model material
That hated hot cereal could grow to be a high silly ho
Really though, it's a shame for this damn dame
'Cause everything's brand name
When will she get enough of these damn games?
Struttin' with her unbuttoned blouse like it ain't nuttin'
Draggin' her wagon, knowin' fellas be flaggin' and frontin'
Hopin' by keepin' her gear, wear and hair dope
And some really Big Willie nigga'll dig her and get open
And give her what only a tenderoni would deserve
She got some nerve thinkin' every nigga's a herb
That goes around trickin' on every chicken that he's stickin'
Male or female, whoever gassed her need an ass kickin'
'Cause if it's more than one fella tryin' to get with her
To hell wit the fly, she only slidin' with the highest bidder
But if you ask me, she's nothin' but a nasty
Money hungry, unclassy, Ho Happy Jackie

Check it, this one Jamaican wasn't fakin' with the bacon
'Cause ever since him, she was on if I'm not mistaken
But then again, this money gettin' Dominican
Caught her when she was fallin' off, and made her win again
Now nothin' can stop it, once she in a nigga pocket
She be seein' more profit than those livest weed spots get
Makin' her income and then some
'Cause even a wedding band on her hand
Won't stop a man who wanna spend some
Diamonds and furs is all she want, that damned Glamour girl
Lovin' it, out there clubbin' it, dancin' like one of Hammer girls
Happy Jackie, the jigga ho
Her job is to jack nigga's dough, I call Jackie the jack a nigga pro
And it's true, count all the fellas she flew through
She even juiced Jack the Jew, Jackie I'm scared of you
And I remember that '87 September
When she was slimmer, she was a ho hoppin' beginner
But now from acne, nappy hair and gear that was tacky
She's on 


""Yo I got that sucka ass nigga.""
""Ooh yes you do

Don't get out foxed, and slicked, and switched into a trick daddy
Trickin' ya whore, hustlin' end for some skins
'Cause next you be trickin' on all you family members and friends
She got a way to make ya feel like ya gotta stay in
It's not a way she'll pay, it's bills that she gotta pay
So married or single, watch out for Jackie when you jingle
She might sting you, and ain't no tellin' what that sting'll bring you
You could fall off point and get careless
Lose all awareness, go hairless, why she wouldn't care if
You go bankrupt, her lifestyle's corrupt
So knowledge before you wisdom or understandin' is fucked

Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware

People who fear me never come near me

Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream

Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights

You're forever trapped in the allies
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape

Indeed I have sucked it up to heights
Unknown to those outside
My body has contained and suppressed
And swallowed and abetted
Oh I am a stranger to myself
Beneath altruism dwells
A force uncontended
A voice that is tempered
To boiled and unhindered


Who am I kidding?
I am not some Mother Theresa
If I don't say something soon
I will break from the weight of the high road I take
No


Indeed I need my chance to fail
Some room to unravel
I need a chance to blame for two minutes
Unbridled, unbrazened
So I need imaginings of maiming
Fantasies of outright screaming
I need a chance to thrash for minutes
Uncontained, unforgiving


Who am I kidding?
I am not some Mother Theresa
If I don't do something soon
I will die from restraint
As a sick subjugate
No


I will move beyond, I'm certain of that
The sooner I go the quicker I'll be back
I would not threaten or cause you any harm
Have to get this out or my light will go out

Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, ""Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael""
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that 
 A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half


We gotta make moves 
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves 
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 


""Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—""


We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu 
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare



We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves

Like this morning reveals to me


And you haven't moved an inch

Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

Can’t nothing good come from me crying

But I can see almost everything that you do
And, wish for better days
If I hope enough, wait long enough

You got me where you want me

Well, it was last week
And you ran out of the house
I heard his sparkomatic
And when you came back
I felt you losing touch
I knew you couldn't be trusted


I should've known better when you're coming to bed at four in the morning
I should've taken your eyes avoiding mine as a warning
Every time I ask you, ""What's up baby?"" you're changing your story
Just so you know that when you go I ain’t begging for you back


I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back
I don’t want you back


Another year passed
Another Friday night
You showed up at the disco
And when we caught eyes
The room started to spin
And my heart nearly busted


I should've known better but the liquor got me thinking I miss ya
I should've taken two steps back but I wanted to kiss ya
Every time you flash those eyes you make me reminisce ya
You’re looking fine, but I'd be lying, if I said I wanted you back


I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back

The bigger the lies the harder they fall
The hotter the fire, the faster the love is gonna burn up
The hotter the fire, the smoke and the mirrors
Its clear I'm better off without ya


I sleep better than every
Night you were lying next to me
Don’t wanna see your face
You need to face the facts
I don’t want you back

But i bounced up on her love one time
I took her to my house, laid her on the couch
Set it affray, then threw her ass out

So what about the girl in the '64?
She didn't mean a damn thing to me baby
She needed a ride from the jam
And being the man that I am, I said ""you can""
And what about the girl in the drop-top?

Four o'clock in the afternoon
And I didn't feel like very much
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy
Where is your famous golden touch?""
I thought you knew where
All of the elephants lie down
I thought you were the crown prince
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town
Just take a look at your body now
There's nothing much to save
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave.""
Now if you can manage to get
Your trembling fingers to behave
Why don't you try unwrapping
A stainless steel razor blade?


That's right, it's come to this
Yes it's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down
Wasn't it a strange way down?


There's no hot water
And the cold is running thin
Well, what do you expect from
The kind of places you've been living in?
Don't drink from that cup
It's all caked and cracked along the rim
That's not the electric light, my friend
That is your vision growing dim
Cover up your face with soap, there
Now you're Santa Claus
And you've got a gift for anyone
Who will give you his applause
I thought you were a racing man
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace
That's a funeral in the mirror
And it's stopping at your face




Once there was a path
And a girl with chestnut hair
And you passed the summers
Picking all of the berries that grew there
There were times she was a woman
Oh, there were times she was just a child
And you held her in the shadows
Where the raspberries grow wild
And you climbed the twilight mountains
And you sang about the view
And everywhere that you wandered
Love seemed to go along with you
That's a hard one to remember
Yes it makes you clench your fist
And then the veins stand out like highways
All along your wrist


And yes it


You can still find a job
Go out and talk to a friend
On the back of every magazine
There are those coupons you can send
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians
They will give you back your hope
You can find your love with diagrams
On a plain brown envelope
But you've used up all your coupons
Except the one that seems
To be written on your wrist
Along with several thousand dreams
Now Santa Claus comes forward
That's a razor in his mit
And he puts on his dark glasses
And he shows you where to hit
And then the cameras pan
The stand in stunt man
Dress rehearsal rag
It's just the dress rehearsal rag
You know this dress rehearsal rag
It's just a dress rehearsal rag

Burning down Neverland 
White lines, black tar, the matches
Is this another death by misadventure?
Tell me what you got, what you really got 

We'll rest in our graves
Lexington, course your veins
Sleepers can't just wake the dead
When needles and lovers collapse on guilty beds


Fall asleep... 
Don't fall asleep...



They lied when they said the good die young
Whoa-oh-hoa-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight


Burning down bridges now 
Godspeed to all you're after
Is this a life left just to remember?
Tell them who you were, who you really were 

Kill yourself slowly over time 
Fashion statement suicide 
She's asleep in the Chelsea hotel
Bad turns to worse and the worst turns into Hell


Fall asleep... 
Don't fall asleep...



They lied when they said the good die young
Whoa-oh-hoa-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight

There's a blue bird at my window
I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in heaven
They don't look the same to me
I just wade the tides that turned
'Til I learn to leave the past behind


It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine


All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Have no time to watch them grow
Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me


It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine


Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missing
Missing all this time


It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Well I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet


Ho ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me


Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly have a holly jolly Christmas

I know this is coming to an end
Aware of all the pain that will ensue
And when it leaves a hole inside my chest
I'm not sure how I'll cover up the wound


My body's filled with my regret
And sorrow
Gloomy symphonies fill my head, mhh


Tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
To cleanse me of your memory and mend me when you're gone
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
And maybe when I play it in my room
I won't feel so empty when I'm thinking about you
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
Mhh-mh, mhh, Mhh-mh


Maybe you'll be on your way to work
And hear it when you're driving down the street
And maybe then you'll wanna make things work
And tell me that you never wanna leave

And sorrow
Gloomy symphonies fill my head, mhh

Smoking rolling reefer up, I adjust the tweakers up
Break it, break it down, break it down so I can beat it up
Where the welcome back? Where the welcome mat? My sneaker tough
This is for my old head go on turn your speakers up
Rocky, where you been? I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep
Bottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm Big Meech
I met with my old head we sat for a while
We rolled a couple swishers, we chat for a while
I said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time
He said what's been goin' down in your New York state of mind
Fine, you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up
Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a townhouse
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out


Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, foes they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight


Now my old head old age bald head rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken shrimp lo mein
Gold chains afros platforms soul train
And he told me 'bout that rapping trapping in the old days
When Pac hung with Suge before that rat tat tat tat nose rings
And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, slow swing, tip foes, and chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up that's my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
Just don't come back flossin' 'cause that type of shit'll get you clapped

Whatever happened to Saturday night?
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright
It don't seem the same since the cosmic light
Came into my life, I thought I was divine!

I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowing on the rock 'n' roll show
We climbed in the back seat and really had a good time
Yeah!

Hot patootie, Bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll! 

My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled
My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear, tonight she really was mine!

Get back in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song
With your arms around your girl you try to sing along
You felt pretty good, yeah
You really had a good time

Hot patootie, Bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll!

Paris say ling hop up in the saline
I chase dreams, man white but the face green
Same thing everyday, everything green
F my reply, ? through the statements
Help me with my statements, I was saving in my savings
From a three bedroom shack I was raised in, the condos out in Jersey full of J. West paintings
Talk to the boy how you talk the lord, talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
? plates, Margiella rugs, my boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs
Hop up out of first class, hop into that E-Class
Cut raw cut school I ain't ever see class

Slackin' on your mackin' and I'm bout to lay my pimp down

Pull up to these shows and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends

When the world, a glass heart aches
Wraps us up, unheard, unscathed

That old hardware store's got eight by tens
In black and white from way back when
Folks still rode their horses into town
See hard work and dirt on blurry faces
And in color ain't much changed
Them buildings might be leanin', oh but they ain't fallin' down


This is a tough town
It's all blood, sweat, and tears
This is some tough ground
If it don't rain it don't grow here
We've been red, white, and blue collar, God and country all these years
If you see us turnin' up and burnin' down we earned it, son
This is a tough town
And this is a tough town


And we got outskirts full of old farmland
But there ain't a rock for sale
'Cause every inch has history to tell
Front porches full of rockin' chairs
Old folks and grandkids sittin' out
And that there's old school love
They're still holdin' calloused hands


This is a tough town
It's all blood, sweat, and tears
This is some tough ground
If it don't rain it don't grow here
We've been red, white, and blue collar, God and country all these years
If you see us turnin' up and burnin' down we earned it, son
This is a tough town
And this is a tough town


We know all about the grapevine
Some folks love to talk
But if you want some of one of us
Just know you got us all


This is a tough town
Yeah boy, this is a tough town
Hell yeah, this is a tough town

"Time in my life I was down so low, a mosquito wouldn't even bite me
I lost my job, my 4 wheel drive, I even got throwed out of my trailer
All because of one thing: freebasing cocaine
That's all my life was, was basing, nothing else
I was on that last lap, with that checker flag
About to wave me on into hell
But I got lucky
I got into rehab program down der in Redstone Arsenal down
Der in Alabama and with dem people helpin' me
Well that smoking white devil is no longer a part of my life
I can proudly say, that white devil is no longer a part of my
Life and I can proudly say, that today, I do not freebase cocaine
Now I'll take a drink, now
I will take a drink but I do not freebase cocaine
You know, well, I take a drink and I might even smoke a little reefer
You know, you know I like to smoke reefer
You know, it relaxes me and everything
A couple doobies, you know, just ta get you through the day and everything
But, far as basin goes, I don't do it
Now I'll do some toot now. Don't get me wrong
I will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything
And somebody comes up and gives it to you
Its impolite not to take it there
So me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you
We do party. You know, I will do some toot
We'll do, you know
On a good weekend there we call a bunch of friend over
We'll do bout an eight ball of toot there but we don't base
I do not freebase cocaine. I want to make that clear. I don't do it

I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


Cold hands, red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
I don't know what came by me


Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines


I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could, they’d say


Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines


I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside

My friends from high school
Married their high school boyfriends
Moved into houses in the same ZIP codes
Where their parents live
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow
I hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling
Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel


I've been a long time gone now
Maybe someday, someday I'm going to settle down
But I've always found my way somehow
By taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around


I met the queen of whatever
Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow


It's been two long years now
Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm getting it back on the road now
But I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
The long
The long way around


Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself
I opened my mouth and I heard myself
It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
Guess I could have made it easier on myself
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow


Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
If you ever want to find me I can still be found
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around

There are so many parts that I have hidden and denied and lost
There are so many ways that I have cut off my nose to spite my face
There are so many colors that I still try to hide while I paint
And there are so many tunes that I secretly sing as I wait
You come along and invite these parts out of hiding
This invitation is the one that I've stopped fighting


Thank you for seeing me
I feel so less lonely
Thank you for getting me
I'm healed by your empathy
Oh this intimacy


There were so many times, I thought I'd die not being truly known
There've been so many moments: forever lonely in my vocation
You come along and celebrate each feeling
And there you are all honor and inquiring


Thank you for seeing me
I feel so less lonely

Required too much you see

Lying awake at night, I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear, cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualise the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground


When it comes to the time are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time, we'll be ready to die


God, let us go now and finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come, thy shall be done on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should we live and let live? Forget or forgive?


But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Smiles in the morning
As warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And 2 loving arms
To console me
I should be scared, it's so right


But, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And, too much of a good thing
Is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on


You look in my eyes
And see my thinking
I know when you're happy, when you're sad
Someone said
It's too perfect
But, I don't think what we have is so bad




And we've got a good thing going on

She said, I don't usually dance this close to strangers
You know a girl can't be too careful with her heart
But I saw you and thought that you looked harmless
But when you smile that way I'm not so sure you are


I said, I don't usually come here for the dancing
You can tell that by the way I move
When I saw you I thought that it was hopeless
But I just had to ask you for a dance or two


Somewhere in the stars it must be written
Girl, we've got to take this chance that we've been given
If there's a heaven here on earth I think we've found it
If this is not love we're dancing all around it

This feels like the beginning of forever

Got nothing to lose
Run out of money
Disposable blues
Sleazy hotels
Like living in hell

With nothing to sell


Want something for nothing
It's always the same
Keep pushin' and shovin'
And I'm down on the game
Always in trouble
Forever detained


Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck


Well, spread out the news
There's a free man loose
Back out of jail
And chasing some flooze
Bad luck has changed
Broken the chains
Laid out a claim
For monetary gains


Wantin' what's coming
All for the take
Freedom for lovin'
And lust for a taste
Eyes are wide open
Wild to the game

Throw down the gates of bad luck

Call grandmami ""mommy"" cause mommy already dead

They know my pedigree, test me I’mma off ‘em

Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade enter flesh it’s an emergency

Feels like my last girlfriend I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the altar
See, I have an advantage I don’t care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin’ when them casings start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds, now a nigga half crazy
What is that a tear I see forming in ya eye
Why are you so frightened, we’re all gonna die
You can say a prayer when I’m coming like the reaper
Staring through that sight on the top of my heater

To make our lives here justified
And not let trouble lurk

While my hectic travelling partner

But only hold me, hold me
All the city's on me
And all their wish to scold me
And lay their hands upon me
So only hold me, hold me
And I'll return you baby
I just need an evening
With someone nice to hide me

"Here come your pride and joy
The comic little drunk you call your boy
Making everybody smile
Who takes your pretty plan
And then becomes a disappearing man
After a little while

I saw you with your makeup running down
Now what's that all about?
You say you don't want anyone around
Cause you're all cleaned out

You toss the empty beer
Not really as composed as you appear
An icicle inside
Wearing clothes that clash
Wondering is this treasure, is this trash
Still trying to decide
And about 5 o'clock here comes your clown
With the front he's throwing down

But all you say is you don't want anyone around
No, not right now
There ain't nothing to drink
You don't want to think about it

I'm sorry you seem so stung
And I'm sorry you think you have to hold your tongue
When you're so pretty and smart
I'm seeing you caving in
Becoming afraid of all these men
That you've given your heart

I saw you with your makeup running down
Now what's that all about?
You say you don't want anyone around
Cause you're all cleaned out
All cleaned out
All cleaned out

You say one thing then you do another
You've got it all wrong so you blame it on your mother
You're kicking the dog because you can't get the cat
You know it ain't cool but you like it like that
Everybody talking about what it is what it ain't
Kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint
But it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
You say you don't need nothing but you've got to have it all


I want to know... what kind of love are you on?


Jelly roll Jane, rolling on the rug
Toking on a lover like a brand new drug
Do the same thing every damn day
Do the same thing, do the same thing
Never seem to get enough


I want to know... what kind of love are you on?
I've got to know... what kind of love are you on?


When Jack took Jill up that hill
She charged his ass a quarter
Well he flipped his lid, uh, cause what she did
Oh, she shouldn't hadn't oughta
Rocking in a cradle with a high school vamp
Screaming at a homey like an old tube amp
Up, down, sideways, going in and out of phase
Everybody asks me why I kiss the girls and make them cry

In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rocking! We keep it rocking!


Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb ass hemp be
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way

Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreaming
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a westside playa where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballies 
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program
Worldwide et 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sacktown, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down, give me love!

My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well


Amen, Amen, Amen


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life


If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life


No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean


Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

In the mosh-pit throwing elbows
Daydream of getting that Phantom Rolls
Pour up, slow down, catch the flow
Bum niggas want to steal my clothes
Thirsty niggas want to fuck my hoes
Run up on me meet the 44
Mobbing ten deep in the Tahoe
Drug money, rap money, more dough

Rap don't work, flip cocaine
Do it for the money, do it for the fame
Don't love the hoes, let my bros run trains
Puffing on gas, lighting up the flame
City on my back like a campaign

I sit on the studio couch
Ask myself what the fuck am I thinking about
Thinking 'bout living without the past and the present
A Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off 600 seconds
10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore
K. Dot had turned Curious George
You know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for
Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads
Before he turned right to get them shots through the door
They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic
So he'd risk his own life, to get someone else killed
But in the process, get injured, it don't make sense
It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying the solve the crime of these rap souls
What if B.I.G. never did it big
Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes
Would it make my flow flow more persistent
Would it raise up the bar of competition, who knows
Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV
Would the battle be less interesting, if it wasn't personal
If Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening
People thinking its a publicity stunt
What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow
Hip-hop would really be fucked
Something like Milli Vanilli
Nothing different, quite similar
Filling up my mind capacity
Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony
What if the shooter-
Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side
Killed two birds with one stone, both would've died
Now lets rewind


Before we go
Can you imagine?
Picture years, with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life


Imagine if Tookie was a Blood, Look, no disrespect
But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets
Dominating the population of-
L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay
Matter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit
Y'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit
No drive bys, no flags stickin' out pockets
No NWA dudes, just rappin like Cre Cru
Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two
Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive
Or would he been lost his life to the streets
No match, no cars in that driveway
What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin
On this L.A. strip, would these rap n*ggas use his name
Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap would they try to fall back on this drug game
These rappers ass backwards
Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine
Not to smoke, but to slang
Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane
Just think about it




Imagine life without death would you even feel alive
Your people that passed, what if they never died
Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness
The street living what if the crack epidemic
Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings
Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims
Imagine if heroine didn't affect our system
They say drug money funding the labels today
What about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A
Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
Would they start in the hood, or executive suites
Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me
You could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore, had won that election
Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected
Imagine the penal system without witness protection
Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling
I don't know, I'm just speaking my mind
Lost in my own soul, Just press rewind and imagine

What's up with this? Used to kick it on the regular
But since the deal, you say my life has changed
I remember when we used to argue and it make no sense
Afterwards we'd make love again


That was way before the videos
Way before the number 1 singles
On the radio, late night at the studio
When I was just CB, nobody knew me
But you were still the same now


Being without you is like having nothing
It don't matter 'bout the money I spend
Got a million plus in my bank account
But it's nothing without you, nothing without you
I ain't been the same since you came in my life
And you're the only one to help me get right
And the way I'm feeling, girl, you need to know
Without you life is back to zero


Baby, just listen, girl, it's just a job so don't look at me different
Looking in your heart, girl, I know you're committed
And what I told you stands true
I've been down for you, baby

Seven billion hungry ghosts
Just a parasite killing its host
The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones
But we're buried by modern misery
Modern misery


There's not enough water in the world
To wash the blood from our hands
We planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul
It grows without light and feeds from our bones
Hell must be empty, all the devils are here
Singing us the Lord's Prayer; finally, something that we all share


I won't go to the grave with the song still in me


What are we hiding in the rain?
This is a prison for lost souls
Another life circles the drain
We used to run with the wolves
Now we can't see the forest
'Cause there's no light in the black hole
Don't try and tell me we are blessed
We used to run with the wolves


Are these our new messiahs?
'Cause the saviour has a gun to my head
Don't be fooled by Maya, the kings are all thieves
And the serpents will bite as they please
How has it come to this?


I won't go to the grave with the song still in me
And I won't live like a slave begging from my knees


What are we hiding in the rain?
This is a prison for lost souls

I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes


No fair


I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared

"When the night has gone cold and you're standing so alone
On the threshold of the rest of what you know
When the fever has died out, turned a flood to a drought
Left a chill inside that's growing like a ghost

You'll come running with eyes that say ""I love you""
You'll be blind, you'll be blind
And I won't know you, I won't see you
I won't need you, I won't love you anymore

When the poison from the wound slowly takes hold of you
And the only way not to drown is not to fight it
When you're falling down the stairs with your superstitions and despair
On a helter skelter fall to your demise

Oh you thought that you would never need
What I could have given if you'd given half a chance

Start again from the end, from beyond where you've been
You can't wash away your sins in shallow water
Cast a stone in a grave of the plans that you made
They only go as far as you can thrown them

You'll come running with eyes that say ""I love you""
You'll be blind, so blind
And I won't know you, I won't see you

She loves the music, tells the tales of her heart
And she listens closely to the beats and the parts
She likes the songs that make her cry
And ones that pick her up and make her high


She likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it
She’s got the country in her iPod on her pocket
She loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle
She even likes the ones where they’re just talking rhyme and riddles
And she sings along when she’s driving home going all alone
Her life’s a song


And she likes the songs that take her back and make her want
Sometimes she just wants to dance and move on
She taps her feet and sheds a tear
Plays air guitar and raises a beer

I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And drive-by's robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had pain in my heart
I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone, it wasn't healthy
I traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain, but I'm still here
Never did like the police
Let the whole world know, now I gets no peace
‘Cause they chasin' me down
And facin' me now, what do I do?
These things that a thug goes through
And still I rise, so keep your head up
And make your mind strong
It's a struggle every day, but you gotta hold on

Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
When it's on, it's on


There's never a good day, ‘cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin' before they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you Blood or you Cuz?
Remember how it was?
The picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin', gettin' high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky
And be strong, most of all, hold on


Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
When it's on, it's on



I know them ain't tears comin' down your face
Wipe your eyes
In this world, only the strong survive, you know?
Hehe, I know it's hard out there
Welfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, car-jackings
Yeah, we got problems
But believe me when I tell you things always get better
God don't like ugly, and God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said?
Bay-bee, God bless the child that can hold his own
You know? You got to stand strong
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face
Tell 'em ""Hold on!"", and be strong
The game don't stop, huh
This here is black, man
If you don't never learn nothin', learn one thing
It don't stop, 'til the casket drop
Thug for life... feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad
Especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin', hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic

When the sun is sitting low
In the sky tonight
The stars are putting on a show
We’re the audience they chose
To hold the light


I’m feeling somethin' so incredible
Some sort of chemical is spreading thick around my brain
I’ve got the sun and I won’t let it go
It burns a fire in my veins


Let’s get out tonight
You’ve got the fire, I’ve got the fight 
In my young blood
Let’s light up the dark
You’ve got the fuel, I’ve got the spark 
In my young blood


The RPMs are in the red
Driving closer to the edge
Up on Flagstaff road
I still remember what you said
“Are you living? Are you dead?”
You better let me know


Put on display just like a cinema
Standing naked on the stage and I’m unashamed
It’s so easy to be cynical
Let’s turn around and start again


Let’s get out tonight
You’ve got the fire, I’ve got the fight 
In my young blood

Better watch what you say

Baby, what do you need?

Bitch I'm armed like a sleeve 
Don't get stuck with a knife

Seen fortune in my lifetime
Gave it all to the man instead
Still tomorrow comes, I'm still standing on my own two feet
Got a woman at home
She treats me well


Anger, I seen it rise
From a careless word that I said
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
Got a woman at home
She told me that
Got a woman at home
She taught me well


Found sorrow in my mind most times
Gave it all back to the life I led
Well since times change, it all just rolls away
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well


She's alright
When everyone is wrong
She's alright
Lets me waste another song
Stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well


Mourning, I've done my time here
Stood here watching my own death
Well a few things going my way this time
Got a woman at home
She treats me well


Slumber, not in my lifetime
Won't spend my days in my bed
Make the whole scene gather round come see it my way
Now I got a woman at home
She treats me well


She's alright
When everyone is wrong
She's alright
Lets me waste another song
Stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now that serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well

"Bursting through the fires avenging
Fatal warning battles are raging
Power of darkness rise for the fight
We'll be strong and stand our ground

Death is all around us and my heart is beating weaker
Fight the day with power of immortal souls arise
Fire in our hearts the evil rages on forever more
Burning until the battle rage is gone

Through damnation we rise sign of the times master of bleeding eyes
Thunder and high look to the sky you never gonna take us down!


And we will cross the evil standing on the temple in the fire storming
Fly beyond the lost horizons high
Heroes of the night are calling
See the promised land is falling
Reaching for the powers deep inside
On through the night

Blinded by the hate and desire
Burning in your heart like a fire
Challenging all the suffer and fear our horizons take control
Blood spills all around us and our enemies draw nearer
Sacrifice your life to have them carry you away
Take us to the place of death and carry on forever more
Burning on the dreams of memories long gone!

And you'll die for your crimes sign of the times master of endless lies
Fight to the end now we ascend together we will take them down

"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Never spoken with my mouth full
Yeah that's a mouthful and I'm doubtful
That I could get these lyrics out, oh
'Cause I think fast but I sing slow
If I ever started rapping
They'd be laughing, they won't believe me
But I got so much I wanna say
So I'm thinking rappers, they got it easy


Someone told me to be selfless
But we are helpless without attention
So if no one's paying attention
Then does my voice get to your headphones
You start thinking 'bout the clock ticks
You get nervous, you start stressin'
So how am I supposed to fit this
In three minutes and thirty seconds


Listen to my aching heart
Quick, before you skip the song
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long


Someone told me to be selfless
But we are helpless without attention
Wealthy people learn the lesson
And never donate without the press there
You wanna skip it if it's wordy
But fit the whole song in three-thirty
I thought I had the ADHD
But that's a real thing and I'm just lazy


Listen to my aching heart
Quick, before you skip the song
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long
We are human after all
And we don't stay for long




Listen to my aching heart
Will you keep this record on
If Ed Sheeran writes my song
I'll finally top the charts
If Ed Sheeran writes my song
I'll finally top the charts

And let that minor chord steer this night
What if I slid a match and lit the wick
What if I shut you up

Drown out all the noise

With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls 
Hear what can start with a whisper

And what if that
Kitchen table gets wrecked
Yeah, plates crashing down
With my breath on your neck
What if that $75.94
You spent at the store
Takes the rest of the night off
As it slides to the floor

Spread out now, Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama's reins
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite, I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
Ah, Rosie, you're the one


Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's, tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, cause you know we ain't gonna come
Ah, I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun
And Rosie, you're the one


Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire


Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there
Ah, Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billy, they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right
So Rosie, come out tonight, oh, baby, come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh, closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for


Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire
All right


Now, I know your mama, she don't like me cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room
I'm coming to lend a hand
I'm coming to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't 
Whoa, your papa says he knows 
Whoa, so your daddy says he knows I don't have 
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because the record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance


And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, I'm stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little café where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear 'em in the back room strummin'
So hold tight, baby, cause don't you know daddy's comin'
Oh, everybody, so!

I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar

California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'


Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it


Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys 
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

'Cause I be paying child support now, goddamn it
Tish was my bitch, 'til she fucked my god brother
I was heated when I heard, wanted to go upside his head
It was Christmas I just bought the bitch a sheepskin kid
I was sick to my stomach nigga this is real shit
I ain't the sensitive type, I ain't sit' around crying
I caught the bitch on the avenue and punched her in the eye


Call it puppy love, Curtis and Janelle in the tree

D's came locked my ass up like a savage
Then came Doobie in the baby carriage
Imagine how it felt summer day pretty blue skies
I gased memorized at her in with green eyes
I'm so into you baby we don't even got touch
That the type shit I say when I really want to fuck
'Cause her cousin Tisha lived by baby spot in forty
Sold crack before rap so everybody know me
Chase Jus down cut his head the motherfucker owe me
Vick's spinning, Cheek's was the hottest rapper in the hood
I ain't hate, but on the low I didn't think he was good
We wore Timberland boots, Carhartt suits
You can tell a nigga paid, when his Filas shoes suede
Rock a Caesar or a fade kept a pistol or a blade
Try to flip a 62 like every couple days
I get knocked I come home it's all a part of the game
Catch a snitch, cut a snitch or put one in his frame
It's like every other summer I was back and forth to jail
Telling nanna Im copping out, so i don't need bail
Just the convesary put the money orders in the mail


Call it puppy love, Curtis and Deawn in the tree

Call it puppy love
Call it puppy love


She came to see me on the alley, wrote me letters all the time
And I responded to the letters so she stayed on my mind
Told myself I'ma grind
As soon as I get out that paper what I'm about
After 4 months home I had the Land I shine
2 months later I copped the Benz my nine
Stay all cocked even when it's hot, Task out
TNT on the block, make yourself get knocked
I just love 'em and leave 'em, I don't give a fuck
I mean she didn't give a fuck, she had a nigga in my truck

Do you ever think about running away?
'Cause I was thinkin' about leavin' today
We'll follow forever where our hearts wanna go
Maybe we'll live somewhere where nobody knows our names
Then things might change for the good


I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone
But as long as we're together, then forever is never too long
Too long, oh no


Do you ever think about not comin' back?
Hoppin' on a train and we'll burn up the tracks
We'll jump off somewhere that we don't know how to say
Maybe hitch a ride from someone who can tell us the way
To where these things might change for the good


I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone
But as long as we're together then forever is never too
Where forever is never too long
Not with you right here by me
Maybe, maybe we'll just see
Where this road will lead for us


I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone
But as long as we're together then forever is never too
I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day

She was 18, all about me, grew up good on the
Tennessee river and her
Daddy didn't like me much
Yeah that might have been part of the rush
I was 21, just a son of a gun rolling like a stone I was born to run
But I never met a girl like that
Had me turning round coming right back
We were crazy, crazy in love like you've never know
She said baby don't you ever let me go


We were fast car, top down
George Straight singing bare feet, slow dance long hair swinging
Under the neon sky, just watching the world go by
And we were laying by the river when the moon started dripping
Finally figured out what a boy been missing
Sinking into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreaming
Man there ain't nothing like a first time feeling


Wrapped up there in a blanket
Nervous kiss, hands were shaking
Yeah we knew we were getting into
There was magic underneath that moon, driving me
Crazy, more than she could ever know
And I said baby I ain't ever gonna let ya go

And that pretty little thing just moved away to
Texas I guess a part of me did too

Here we go


Well, I won two dollars on a scratch off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought two more with it
And I won ten bucks and that was just right
So I bought a six-pack and a bag of ice
You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain't like we really need a million dollar yacht
'Cause


We got an inner-tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river  and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We're laughing all the way to the river bank


Still can you imagine if we ever struck it
I'd go shoot tequila take a lime and suck it
And we'd all tell our bosses they can do the same
We'll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing
We'd sail around the world and go to shore in a dinghy
But 'til that dream comes true why don't you grab your bikini
'Cause


We got an inner-tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river  and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We're laughing all the way to the river bank


Fire up the Sea-Doo, that's how we do
Good Lord o' mercy, sure hope she do
Wanna float down the river
Give a sip of that shine, make her liver quiver
We hangin' at the river bank
You know ATM's not where we swim
Just beer, floats, trucks, girls
Welcome to our world


However it goes, get rowdy, get wet, get wild
We got it made, crank it up, drink it up, get loud
Cause, baby we can float, the river bank is always open
Or we can ride a wave, don't worry 'bout us we floatin'
Come on Brad get rip


We got an inner-tube
We got a trailer hitch
We're near the river  and far from rich
But we've got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day 
We're laughing all the way to the river bank

Uhh, East New York, East New York

To my nigga AZ, hit it off


We was already molded into people's minds as mulignanes
Now we more fucks'd up with a mayor named Giuliani
You can try to blind me, analyze but can't define me
My mind's divine, heavily entwined with Gandhi's
Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through
'Cause my cerebrals are more of a higher plane than the Hebrews
My mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions
Overdosin' wannabes posin', sendin' them through convulsions
Too hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow
Your mind's boggled
But I'm as deep as Donald Goines novels
My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
And since a minor, I been fuckin' with marijuana
Wavy-hair, my skin got a money gettin' glare
Strictly menace wear, mackin' off a Guinness beer
So, where it all begins is here
Destiny and me finally meet
So, how can I be weak? I'm rather unique

So check it out why, why, why I'm rather unique
AZ check him out, one time why, why, why I'm rather unique


My verbals rip shit, brains give birth to thoughts in triplets
Fuck it, I'm on some flip shit, ready to let my clip spit
Dramatical, vocals release shells like automatics do
Music's magical, causin' any battles to be tragical, child
Got a style sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia
Slaughter your circulatory like leukemia
Filled with larceny, who want parts of me? I'm vicious
Mad malicious 'cause it's real on this road to riches
I got this mastered, other rappers'll graft it, weak and wicked
Camouflagin' as killers; how they speak and kick it
Peep this uniqueness, non-believers I'm leavin' speechless
Left to choke as if skunk smoke was comin' through the speakers
Surgically nice with any verbal device
Trife, breathin' life into mics
My eyesight's beyond the twilight
So, die or fight, no surrender, no retreat
Techniques speak, I'm rather unique


So check it out why I'm rather unique
Uhh why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York why, why, I'm rather unique
Why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York why, why, I'm rather unique  why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York  why, why, I'm rather unique
My man AZ to the fullest


So, it's gonna take more than your astrologist to knowledge this
Physiologists couldn't even figure out the exoticness
Raps demolishin', certified the way I style it
My wordplay blaze with the rays of ultraviolet
My culture's smilin', gettin' more in depth with each breath
Autobiography follows the footsteps of Malcolm X
Money and sex, Gore-Tex, Donna Karan and Guess
Finesse, success through the life stress, mics I bless
Puffin' trees to get me high as trapeze
Lookin' Japanese, at ease when I'm stackin' G's
So, let's discuss, plus degrees
Why the rhyme force is the source for thoughts that's lost
So, don't cross 'cause it'll cost
The ghetto savior, smooth for real, playa with flavor
Moves be major, with un-explainable behavior
The word's on the street so keep your ears to the concrete
Why I'm rather unique


Why I'm rather unique

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might


They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
$now Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all


It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might


Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken
Think I'm joking when I'm talkin' about blowing my head open
'Till the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
Wrists slit
Thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit
Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin'
Lane switchin', same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch


It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

Se dice que el ansioso esconde un alma en paz
Viajero o misionero, va lejos mucho más
Si miro hasta el cielo, o dentro mío, no sé
Ya nada importa mucho
Si puedo, con sinceridad, saber que lo intenté


Como el mar y su creciente
Va la gente al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la mañana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento
Y lo hago al andar


Viajé por tantos lados en la imaginación
Estamos siempre andando, sin tiempo ni razón
¿Quién sabe las respuestas, quién puede elegir?
Si existen diferencias
Sabemos que hay, en cada ser, deseos de vivir


Como el mar y su creciente
Va la gente al andar
Como el viento y su corrida
Va la vida al andar
Como el sol a la mañana
Que reclama el andar
Atesoro el momento
Vivo y siento, es mi intento
Y lo hago al andar


La brisa que acaricia con suavidad el mar
Y todas las gaviotas que vuelan sin cesar
Lo veo y lo siento, y no lo sé explicar
Espléndido momento
Sentir llover, y el sol nacer
Vivir y disfrutar

Nothing in this world can refresh your soul like being home

But I can't put my finger on when, the why, or hows
And there's a coldness in the way she swears
I'm not the reason she's not in the mood
And it tears me up inside to lie here next to her
While she lies to me about you

She thinks I don't know but I'm about to lose control
She's the kinda love that builds you up enough
But she can't stand to be alone
Hell's what I'm gonna raise, cause I'm Hell bent on a change
Buddy finish your drink its on me, then get up and walk away

You see I've known her long enough to know
How she was before she was mine
And I'm not oblivious
Its just I've been the only one for all this time
So now you know the reason I came in here tonight
To put an end to this romance
There's nothing you can say or do to prove to me
That shes not worth a second chance

She thinks I don't know, but I'm about to lose control

Rose colored glasses
They couldn't shield anything
Golden flames that burn
But couldn't heal me from within
Disperse the heat
Let the cold sweep in, oh
Burst in languid light
As my head and body spin


When your skin doesn't feel like home, oh
And I don't wanna break down and feel alone, oh oh oh
This body only knows, oh
How to hold back more than it shows, oh oh oh


A superstition
That found itself in the way
Of a freed premonition
That could have helped me escape
It's the wrong kind of victory
Disguised as a breakthrough
It's hard when nothing
Fits like it used to


When your skin doesn't feel like home, oh
And I don't wanna break down and feel alone, oh oh oh
This body only knows, oh
How to hold back more than it shows, oh oh oh


Hairs on my hand, stand on end
The spine of this truth, repel and suspend
Act like bars, but should help me transcend

Here I go, here I go, this that C5
Bitch, I’m back, with that crack like panty lines, asinine
I get blow like dandelions, fuck more hoes than advertised
They say, ""Tune, you’re dead wrong,"" I say wrong had to die
Pussy nigga don’t keep it real no more
Drug dealers changed, but the high stay the same
Prices go up, but the high stay the same
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain
Chillin’ in the crib with the lock on the door
Layin’ on the couch with the Glock on the floor
Within arm reach, security, alarm breach
I just cut off the lights, hope I don’t shoot my hoe
I eat so much shrimp
I smoke so much hemp
The world too small, it feel like four walls
You see, I got holes punched in
My chances are cold cut thin
But I still took ‘em, and nigga, we made it
T, roll that killer, weed up in the swisher
And make it as fat as a pig in a blanket
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin
They cry for help, we get ‘em a hankie
Ain’t nothing sweet but the shit that we drinkin’
The bitches we bangin’, the cinnamon danish
The penalty's pending, shit is restraining
It is a shame, but niggas is shameless
Niggas is assholes
Or enemas, finna get anal
Injury, time out, I just blew my mind out
But still I’m maintaining
Real gangsta shit, it get dangerous
You talking money and guns, two languages
I throw niggas from off of the plane I’m in
""Oh, my God, it’s rainin' men""
Said the weatherman to the anchorman
I send hella cash to the bank I’m with
What you do it for if it ain’t for this?
I watch my step so much, I’m starting to feel like my ankles’ wrist
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I’m in Anchorage when I think of this
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances


Bitch, I smell like money, dopeman cologne 
I say, bitch, I smell like money , that’s that dopeman cologne 
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone 
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone
‘Cause bitch, I smell like money 
I smell like money
When you this rich, they call it wealthy
Shit, they gotta call it somethin’
Yeah, Lord, I done got too rich for stuntin’, damn
But not for thuggin’
That’s right bitch I smell like money , money 
You smell me coming


Yeah, 2 Chainz, uh
Totin’ double barrels in a horse and carriage
Ain’t scared of nothing except God and marriage
Through the concrete grew a rose petal
If trapping was a sport, I’d have a gold medal
I steal her, like Jerome Bettis
Call me Trill Cosby, I might spike my own beverage
Parallel park in front of Neiman Marcus
He ain’t never fly, nigga, like an ostrich
They say ain’t nothing for free, but please free my partners
Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces
Yeah, lobster rolls for an appetizer
Bad red bitch give me a lap-etizer
I’m in my Rolls Royce because it’s black and wiser
And don’t get in the way, my nig, this rapid fire
Brrr, stick ‘em, I’m a victim of being a victim
Codeines, Xanax, and liquor
Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean Molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils
Had a threesome with two sisters
I get head and you kiss her
I don’t never call and you miss her
I got every gun except a missile
I paid attention to the minister
My silhouette is sinister
Only child with trust issues
You couldn’t walk a mile in my hoop shoes
Me and Tune, two loose screws
Two parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn’t even pop up
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck
Polo T and ice watch, moccasins without socks
And I smell like money, I can count a hundred thousand with the lights off
Woo! Yeah


I say, bitch, I smell like money, that’s that dopeman cologne 
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone 
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone

"If you'll gather 'round me, people
A story, I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife, she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down

Now, he took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name

He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door

Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill

'Twas in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say:

You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief

Well, it's through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen

Well, it's through this world you ramble
It's through this world you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home

How you gonna take this? like a man or a bitch?
You gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
Man, I stack chips and I unload clips
After 3 summers in the jail I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
You know me, started sellin' leak in the yard
Yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
Big as hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
Damm dog, you been in here that long?
You could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
A convo is only three words, ""yo what up""
You ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
And you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After witnesses disappear on the strength of they team
I'm hard as hell to get along wit' so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in bible paper - blowin' the lah
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
And when I shot you in New York why would I box you now?
If I catch you going to sick call I'm'a ox you down
Niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
In here a gemstar is like a nine milli chrome
It's similar, in fact they'll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home


You got blown over the jack? 
Your man ran when you got clapped? 
Rockin' a vest with no gat? 
You only a thug when you rap? 
Niggas juxed you for your track? 
You ran to other thugs to get it back? 
Niggas ran off with your packs? 
If you ain't bustin' ya gat 


You'd call me Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box so much it seems like I'm visitin' pop-ulation
When I walk by, niggas like ""Fifty don't play son""
""yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga...""
Max out, I'm goin' straight for the Glock
Bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
The things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
Down goes the window....out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' track meet
Some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
Some get it in the foot, bleed all over their Air Max
Nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
It's extortion, it happens in the hood often
Claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
Cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit cause I stay on that block shit
That 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
See the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
Ya'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
Leave with your blood on my mink in the drop six

I couldn't help but notice your pain
My pain?
It runs deep – share it with me!


They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker – who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless, rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb ‘cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me – what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family – what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs!
Got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang-bangers and drive-by's
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young, but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court, so fuck what you thought!
I'm drinkin' Hennessy, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain


Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain


Years and years of that rough life
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife
And livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors
See 'em fake a move and chase 'em down like the fuckin' Predator
Get in trouble every day in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches ‘cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passin' me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's lookin' lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back yo, give 'em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo' ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you owe, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game
And my mama always cryin' yo, there's so much pain


Ohhhh…
So tired, so tired...
Ohhhh…
So...so...


They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed, and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust – I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust – on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‘cause I ain't lookin' when I'm blastin'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy, and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die, tell me why
‘Cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
I keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real, they cannot see
And every day is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother, I'm touched
Out kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean, until they kill me
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me; there's so much pain


Ohhh…

Got for real about my papers, 'cause the game was wild

But since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but are you still down


Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?


I wrote this for my critics and my enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail
Just as well, 'cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped
And mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, ""Baby, it's on!""
And now I'm hustlin' and bustin' them bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin' G's
Buyin' all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town
Please tell me, are you still down?

Are you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me
Are you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me
Are you still down? Raise 'em up
Are you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me

That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin' middle finger
Raise 'em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug life niggas be the sickest
You feel me?
Now get that shit written down
God damn!
Took four years and a motherfuckin' case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?
Are you still motherfuckin' down?

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven


Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder


There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking


Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder


And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter


If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on


And it makes me wonder
Ohhhh, woah


Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind




And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll


And she's buying a stairway to heaven

It's being me losing the ones I love
Pain is watching my mum and cry
Just can't stop the tears
Is what I've licked on myself

Can't keep pretending
It's gonna be alright

'Cause I don't need this love
When it hurt so much
I don't need this love
Sometimes it ain't above

Won't you wake me from this dream

When there's no way out
And nobody's home
Pain is just part of me
Feelin helpless inside
It's everything when I believe
When I got nowhere to hide
Can't stop the emptiness
Even if I try

'Cause I don't need this love

I don't need this love
Sometimes it ain't a love

Turn it up loud
Sucker for love, sucker for love

Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
Sucker for love


I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be, you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...



Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me, say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it
But in this case, what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep it goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head, I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You're gettin’ calls at the house, guess you're cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...



Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you, a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it, now I’m under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love


What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything...

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me


Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again


We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers


And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt


We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers


There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand


We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy

Say a prayer on the book of the dead

Even through this fog it's clear

 down and bought a bean burrito

There won't be a place to park

Gotta get home, get showered, get changed
Lord, let there be a clean shirt on the rack

Finally headed the right way

Wasn't out too late, just up too early again

Or if I said I love you
Would you simply walk away?
Thought we'd grow together
But every day we're further
Thought I did the right thing
But deep inside I'm dying


When I see you, my friend
When I see you, my friend
See you again
See you again, my friend
Girl, you know you wanna see me again


You're the greatest, forever my baby, my friend
'Cause you will always be my, my friend

Babe, you get what you want
And you take what you need
Cause you took every little thing
Every little thing just for loving me
Did you ever spare a thought
For how we were supposed to be?
Cause I heard every single word
Every single word until I believed
Any moment now any moment now
You'll be coming around


It's not right, it's not fair
Why can't you just love someone
Until they're over the edge?
Cause what we had it's just not there
How can you leave me undone
Cause that's what you did


I heard you found a softer touch
I guess that couldn't have been too hard for you
Cause by the way you looking now
The way you looking down baby you know what you are
But she will never be enough
Enough to fill that empty space
I know that you don't have inside, you don't have inside
It's just the bad that you made
And I know any moment now, any moment now
You'll be coming around


It's not right, it's not fair
Why can't you just love someone
Until they're over the edge?
Cause what we had it's just not there
How can you leave me undone
Cause that's what you did


And I told myself that I could fix what's broken
Every single time
And I always end up leaving myself open
Every single time


It's not right, it's not fair
Why can't you just love someone
Until they're over the edge?

There's a certain spring in your stride
You face the future like a heat-seeking missile
You've got yourself a smile a mile wide

You're floating free, gravity defied

Just steel your nerves for a bright white knuckle ride

And run for their lives

It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier

Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

Keeping my head to the curb

They claim that I'm violent
Just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin' fits
’Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it
Envious because I will rebel against
Any oppressor - and this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
’Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The Underground Railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told 'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist, cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this!
My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent


""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""


The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?""
He had the nerve to, say that I had a curfew

Get out the car - or I'lI hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete


They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked  he tried to run
 I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless

Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Givin' him a taste, of trading places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin' that I'm violent


""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""


As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click 
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop  now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away

They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start  we in deep shit
So we jumped out 
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights

If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge

Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'
This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust
 What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me
 Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin' them a reason, to claim that I'm violent


""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""

Reminds me of the time I was insane
And so I wrote it when I was loaded
And voted the least likely to turn out like a square

I'm singing it for your ears
Jump up and down and leave the ground and know that's why your here
And they say down diggey down down, down diggey diggey down, stronger, longer
Line up your ways of know what I'm thinking say it again

And now I'm with my home team back with a good seat

But love in my blood sonic in the vortex

'Cause I refuse to let you think you can play with my mind
Always seems that you think that I'm blind
'Cause theres always certain times when you're hard to find
You're on the go, I'm on the go, we're on the go
I can't catch you no more, can't see you no more
And it no longer can be ignored
'Cause that once upon a time it was you I adored
You disappeared and left me here out in the cold
And the absence of you is hurting my soul
Didn't know that was an end of the road
It was so easy for you just to let it all go



I refuse to have one more sleepless night

I refuse to let a tear fall out my eye

I refuse to continue to try
I felt like I would die or I could break down and cry


I refuse to let you walk back through that door

I refuse to let you hurt me anymore

I refuse to continue to ignore
The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door



No way I can take it baby
 No way I can take it baby
 No way
But I refuse to take it anymore


Remember when I told you I could feel the change 
You don't touch me the same , nor hold me the same 
Now I don't want you to take all the blame
'Cause I know I had those moments when I caused the pain
This back and forth, just like a war, with you and me 
See we both disagree, have we ever agreed?
This ain't nothing like I thought it would be
Was it all just a dream, was it ever in my reach?

I refuse to let you hurt me any more

The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door


It was your way, or it was no way
And I couldn't live that way
It was our call, and then it was your call
'cause I gave you my all and all



I refuse to have one more sleepless night

I refuse to let a tear fall out my eye

I refuse to continue to try
I felt like I would die or I could break down and cry


I refuse to let you walk back through that door

I refuse to let you hurt me any more

I refuse to continue to ignore
The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door


No way I can take it baby
No way I can take it baby
No way
But I refuse to take it any more

No, no, no way I can take it baby
No, no, no way I can take it baby
No, no way

You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!


Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah


So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' 
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight 
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah


I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G



It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel

Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught 
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah


I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G


My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers

So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah


I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again


Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears

And despite my growing fears

And see the world hanging upside down

And you are
If I only hadn't given you up
If you only hadn't given me up
And you are
If I only hadn't given you up
Losin' my breath and leavin' the rest


And run if you like
All of the mistakes that you left behind
Hold me down
You can't deny and I can't deny
Open your eyes
I'll look away and you come around
To build your words
High enough to carry you over


And I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up


Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up

Hey you, big star
Tell me when it's over


Hey you, big mood
Guide me to shelter
'Cause I'm through when the two
Hits the six and it's summer



 Shove it! Shove it! Shove it!
 Shove it! Shove it! Shove it!
 Shove it! Shove it! Shove it!
 Shove it aside!


I think God is moving its tongue
There's no crowd in the streets and no sun
In my own summer


The shade is a tool, a device, a savior
See, I try and look up to the sky
But my eyes burn



 Shove it! Shove it! Shove it!
 Shove it! Shove it! Shove it!
 Shove it! Shove it! Shove it!
 Shove it aside!

Spirit on the water
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby
I can't hardly sleep


I'm traveling by land
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind
I can't stay away


I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends


When you are near
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you, gal
You ought to be a fool about me


Can't explain
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart
You got the key to my brain


I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love


Life without you
Doesn't mean a thing to me
If I can't have you
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea


Sometimes I wonder
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day
Then you do wrong all night


When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter
What price I pay


They brag about your sugar
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down


I'm pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them


I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me


I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind


Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind


I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me


From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can


I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back ‘till fall


High on the hill
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two


I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there


You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin' good time

Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay

Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the fuck was that ugly ass boy I saw?
Yung Mutt, what a dumbfuck, dirty like a dump truck
Such a fucking bum, hauntin' sluts guts
I'm disgusted, I'm busted up
What the fuck did I just put up my nose?
I'm buggin' out, knees buckle
I'm duckin' out, I'm in trouble
Now I can see the clouds, lights out
Now I lay myself to sleep, now that I can rest in peace
No questioning my misery, my deathwish granted blissful sleep
My body turns to worms for the birds to eat
Internal decay for eternity


Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard


I can't lie, lately, I been on the fucking edge
Pistol gripped up on my lap
Xanax, heron, bunch of meds
Fantasizin' about death, just need one in my temple
Put the gun up to my head
Fuck this shit, I shot the lead and now I'm dead
Descendin' through hell, nothing but burnin' flesh smells
I scream, and scream, and scream
And hear the others yell as well
Oh well, just my luck
Devil opens up to devour me, that was my old life
Antichrist, he has empowered me


Mmm, mmm, good—
Mmm, mmm, good—

Time marches on, but I stand still
Could someone please explain this to me so I can stop asking myself?
How do these thoughts make their home in my head
You’re not invited here, you’re not wanted here, please leeeeeee..
Oh wait, that's right, forgive me, I invited you here
Now take a seat, I’ve got something to tell you


Sweetheart, remember me?
I'm more than just a memory
You've drained all my energy
And I don't know how to let it be
Same old song, I guess it's just a new genre
They don't know that I created all this drama
'Lord, save my soul' but I know I don't believe it
I should say no more, I found a lady for the evening
And she's got many faces and she's got many names
Just like the Mona Lisa, cause they all look the same
You're my imagination, allow me to explain
Welcome to my addiction
Sweetheart, this isn't me
I need a dose of reality
Don't know what's gotten into me
Feel like I'm running from the enemy


You and I, it's a suicide
This is do or die, if I don't do it right
And I know what I should do about it
But I don't know if I can do without it
You and I, it's a suicide
It’s a do or die, if I don't do it right
And I know what I should do about it
I'ma have to do without it


Too often I am caught in my own head
Wondering if tonight I'll share my bed
Cool and calm on the outside, but shook to the core
Being devoured by lions, you can tell by the roar
But this can't be life, this can't be love
I desired the pigeon and set free the dove
Things move too fast when egos get hurt
And bad seeds are planted when we dig in the dirt
So, I toss the shackles to the side, but they find their way back
Not this time satan, I can't go for that
I'd be lying if I said the devil made me do it
But that path is the one that leads to ruin
My actions, my words they gon’ paint a new picture
Take her off the wall... She's out my life and I don't miss her
It's clear my time is now, the battle will be won
Turn my back to the darkness it’s time to face the Son


You and I, it's a suicide
This is do or die, if I don't do it right
And I know what I should do about it
But I don't know if I can do without it
You and I, it's a suicide
It’s a do or die, if I don't do it right
And I know what I should do about it
I'ma have to do without it


Sweetheart, remember me?
I’m on the road to recovery
The Lord has forgiven me
Your slave ain't what I wanna be
I sang along, but now it's time to go solo
Play no more, I left the game like Tony Romo
I'm so sure that you're going to leave my head soon
All Amour, I want the love before the bedroom


Honey, can you look at your Daddy please?
First of all, I love you little bunny, you know that right?
Yes Daddy
Good, You see angel, everyday I work hard to be the type of man that you can look up to and be proud of
Because one day, you’re going to meet the man that you want to marry
And he ain’t gon’ be perfect, just like me!
But as long as he loves you unconditionally and puts the Lord first, you’ve found yourself a great man

Mary queen of Arkansas, it's not too early for dreamin'
The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastard's love can be redeeming
Mary, my queen, your soft hulk is reviving
No, you're not too late to desecrate, the servants are just rising


Well, I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade
I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state
Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing
You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing
The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the border
And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order
But I was not born to live to die, and you were not born for queenin'
It's not too late to infiltrate, the servants are just leavin'


Mary queen of Arkansas, your white skin is deceivin'
You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin'
But on your bed, Mary, I can see the shadow of a noose
I don't understand how you can hold me so tight and love me so damn loose


But I know a place where we can go, Mary
Where I can get a good job and start out all over again clean
I got contacts deep in Mexico where the servants have been seen

She love the way I cheat
She love the way I move, I sh, I show it to her
Shows about 100, goon

Black car, black flags

Giving me a bad vibe, guess I'm just a bad guy

Troublesome nigga
Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfuckin'-96
Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli


Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan
To be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me that little brat
Shit them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
Cause they fear me in physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome


La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lah
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die
Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, haha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome
La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lah
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die
Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome


Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor bet I bomb on the first niggas
Knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin' off freely
Screamin, ""Fuck - ALL Y'ALL NIGGAZ"" in Swahili
Pistol-packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor learned to get high and pull drive bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin thoughts of my enemies pleadin', please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died;
Cause I'm troublesome


Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless - I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus BA-BAY
I'm troublesome, haha
Bad Boy killa', there is no one realer
What you saw was the rough rugged and raw - Outlaw!


Murder murder my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme - the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep; I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life;
I'm troublesome


In your wildest dreams, you couldn't picture a nigga like me
Haha, I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome like my nigga Napoleon said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Haha, I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don, the boss of all bosses
Mussolini, E.D.I. Mean, Hussein Fatal, Kadafi
Kastro, Napoleon, Komani
Haha, we ain't fuckin' around, we troublesome
Ayeo, haha, we troublesome, I ain't goin', haha
Young Kastro, the first to blast the last one to dash
Goin' for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas, Outlawz
Kadafi, trump tight never sloppy
Them motherfuckas try to copy
But they can't mock you nigga, you're too strong
Outlawz keep it goin' on, you know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz, haha
Che Guevara on the beats y'all
A.k.a. Jose Johnny J The Cuban Militant
Outlawz, Outlawz
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets
I rather die than see the penitentiary
We all fuckin' Outlawz
You know what time it is
You see any motherfucker with a Outlaw on his neck, give him respect or get chin-checked
All our enemies getting wrecked
From the TEC to the Mini-14, we make you all scream
Death before dishonor, the first to bomb, ring the alarm HA HA
Try to flee but you cannot defeat what's in your mind
Outlawz every time, we Outlawz
Troublesome
Troublesome nigga, you know
Troublesome ahahaha
All in your mind, every time

Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""

Guys like me, you want in an alley with ya
Up a creek, ain't a doubt I'm gonna paddle with ya
Go to bat, go to church, go to battle with ya
They can say what they want about me, but


The ones that need me got me
The ones that doubt me can't stop me
Even the ones that said, “Forget him.”
You can bet they ain't forgot me
Either wanna hit me or hold me
Those that hate me don't know me
And the ones that don't trust anybody trust me
Yeah, the ones that like me love me


Speak my mind, don't mind who's listenin'
I'll ask forgiveness, 'fore I ask permission
Least with me you know what you're gettin'
You may not get a thing about me, but


The ones that need me got me
The ones that doubt me can't stop me
Even the ones that said, “Forget him.”
You can bet they ain't forgot me
Either wanna hit me or hold me
Those that hate me don't know me
And the ones that don't trust anybody trust me
Yeah, the ones that like me love me


Yeah, they love me
And I ain't perfect, I'm a simple man
I got a sinner's mind, but I can fold my hands
I ain't afraid to pray and I do know who I am, yeah


And the ones that need me got me
Ones that doubt me can't stop me
Even the ones that said, “Forget him.”
Bet your ass they ain't forgot me
Either wanna hit me or hold me
Those that hate me don't know me
And the ones that don't trust anybody trust me
Yeah, the ones that like me love me


The ones that like me love me

And if you don't
Probably a pretty good chance I don't like you either

Hey boy, won't you play for me
Right now, give me that old school beat
I wanna hear it here , grooving all night long
I gotta let you know you got it going on
Play it for me




Hey boy, let me hear your song
Yeah, play 'til the break of dawn
Keep it right here, grooving all night
I gotta let you know that it feels so right
Play it for me




Yo, back in the days I used to listen to records
Trying to figure out how I could make my own records
Working in restaurants, busting on dishes
Hoping that the man upstairs respect my wishes
Cigarette lighters, Ardig wallets, I was selling them
'Till I met the B.H. and bust down A Capella to him
He said you got talent and you're going places
I'd heard that line before but what the heck, I signed the papers
Ever since that day I drew my head high it was on
And now I'm mixing new music with the old school songs

"Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

If I, if I have been unkind
I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

The cowboy lives forever
As long as there's a faded pair of blue jeans
Wide brimmed hats and leather
And dreams


There's a little bit of Roy and Dale in all of us
Though all of us don't wear the cowboy boots and spurs
A man will dream of rescuing a damsel in distress
And the girl likes to dream that it's her


The cowboy lives forever
As long as there's a faded pair of blue jeans
Wide brimmed hats and leather
And dreams


He was born from the dust of the western plain
Raised up tall and straight like a cactus tree
His home range stretches from Hawaii to Maine
He's John Wayne, he's Gene Autry, he's me


The cowboy lives forever
As long as there's a faded pair of blue jeans
Wide brimmed hats and leather
And dreams


You can find a cowgirl at the rodeo
She'll shuffle to the two-step like the cowboys do
She might be wearing petticoats or maybe boots and chaps
She's Patsy Cline, Loretta, Kitty Wells or Emmylou or maybe you


The cowboy lives forever
As long as there's a faded pair of blue jeans
Wide brimmed hats and leather
And dreams

"Here I come to find myself, catch the tide
Looking for a peace at the end of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself, fever's high
I'm all at sea and so unwise
I'm so afraid I'll lose your love, as time goes by
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright
The sunset built a memory, our love sign
And all at sea we come alive
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home
I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I design
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all at sea we say goodbye
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope
And take me to a place called home
Looking for a place called home

Hell motherfuckin' yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Cooley


They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way


Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin' at sixteen
On the scene watchin' fiends buggin'
Kickin' up dust with the older G's
Soakin' up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot
I learned not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes
Taught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions
While other suckers was guessin', I was gangsta sexing
Elementary wasn't meant for me
Can't regret it I'm headed for the penitentiary
And cuttin' class and I'm buckin' blastin' straight mashin'
Mobbin' through the overpass laughin' 
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out
No doubt, they jealous of a nigga's clout
Tell me lord can ya feel me?
I keep my finger on the trigger
Cause some nigga tryna to kill me


They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way


Tell me lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellraiser can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin' to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the poor babies rushin' into early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear lord I live the life of a thug hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock
Tell me lord can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggas burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row


They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way


Dear lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin' please come save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' ""die motherfucker!"" and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover!
Aww shit, ""Thug-Life motherfucker, duck quick!""
Now am I wrong if I am, don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Dear lord if ya hear me tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it
It shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl
Killed Latasha
Now I'm screamin' fuck the world!


They said
I could never do it, I will never stand up
I 'd never survive it
But I don't care what they say
I'mma do it my own way
And if these people can't handle the way I do me
I won't have to answer, I'd finally be free
They say, I should how they say
But I'mma do it my way

Told him, ""bring the Chevy""
Little does he know, I got a grave dug in a levee
Glock cocked, and it's ready
Told him, ""slide up out the whip""

Lights out!


If tomorrow's not here, I write down all of my worst fears
Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers
Apparently I will watch the whole world collapse and appear
No tears, my intuition tells me that the end is near
The only thing I should fear is fear itself
Learn that being afraid of God is being afraid of yourself
So go to church nigga, but I won't go cause I don't know
Where all the money and the collection plate go
If the church still owe, then you know, read your bible at home
I'ma read it myself, all the stories that I'm reading show me how to prevail
The guard came in the other day and gave me some mail and said that I got a phone call
When I get out we gon' go harder than Medusa, building stone walls out of human flesh
Dave Koresh, burn that shit down even though I'm not around
I know you gon' hold it down till the day that I get out


If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
So are you it, or you ain't, or just claiming to be?
Either you're something, or nothing, or just nothing to see
If tomorrow's not here
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching


If tomorrow's not here, I write down all of my worst fears
Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers
We, been afraid of something that is out of my control
Like a verse from Duckworth, make a silly rapper's butt hurt
Sodomized through the eyes of a troubled youth
Talking between the bars, you tell them within the booth
Way back in 2012 when a nigga was 22
Passed you the Tropicana now my niggas got the juice
For millennias to come, go Millennium Falcon
Fuck a hand out, I'd rather leave my hands solo
The smartest thing you ever did, Curry, was going solo
While I'm in the county blues, lofty bout to take over the promo for the fam
I'm here because I never gave a damn, like an angry beaver
Smoking dust and reefer
Live life, smoke a pound, even though I'm not around
I know you gon' hold it down till the day that I get out


If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
So are you it, or you ain't, or just claiming to be?
Either you're something, or nothing, or just nothing to see
If tomorrow's not here
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching

You who has soldiered through the profane
They were distracted and shut down
So why, why would you talk to me at all?
Such words were dishonorable and in vain
Their promise as solid as the fog


And where was your watchman then?

I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand
The greatest honor of all, as your guardian

No more holding still in the hailstorm

I want you, I'm on you


I can't lie, I won't lie, it's amazing
My faces go places, you're taking me
Baby take your time now, there's no need to rush
We can go another round if that's what you want
'Cause tonight it's going down, yeah, you know it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop; ooooh ohhhhh


You can keep your hands on me
Touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you
Your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, ohhh


I said what you wanna do? What you gonna do?
You know I don't come empty handed and you know I contribute
I just wanna spend one night with you, hit the party like it's '92
I said let's get straight to the point that's just mine point of view
I said since you walked into the door, you hit the floor, now that the feelings arrived
Now we feeling the zone, we feeling the vibe, vibe, vibe
I said all we do is this, we ain't dancing no mor, glass in my hand, and my pants Polo
A night like this and you can't be solo
You should remember that life is for that's living the most, most


The things I wanna do to you
My body's calling you
I'm having so much fun with you
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party

Summer days 
Lost in another way 
I was lost in another way 


Who was the man behind the mask
Exploring your secrets is no easy task
'Cause it happened long ago 
You told me the secrets of living large
And how to behave with my friend in the dark
Our story lingers on 


How I'm longing for you to give
Me some magic for us to live
If you told me it could be done
I'd believe


Summer days
At the sea
It was just you and me
I was lost in another way
Every day
Seconds ago
But why did you have to go?


A teardrop of rain is where you are
My perfect and gentle star of the stars
Our story lingers on 


How I'm longing for you to give
Me some magic for us to live
If you told me it could be done

The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, ""He has to die, you know he has to die.""
All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin'
Every leaf was turnin'; to watch him die, you know he has to die

The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die, you know he had to die


Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

Comin', around, in a circle

There was cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

Gather the wind
Though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun and it tears away
And it breaks you as you run, you run, you run
Behind the smile there's danger
And a promise to be told
You'll never get old
Life's fantasy, to be locked away
And still, to think you're free, you're free, we're free


So live for today
Tomorrow never comes


Die young, die young

Die young, gonna die young

"Searching for something
A million miles and a ways to go

Bro I had a dream man it was buried in lore
That I was sailing on the seas and I was out to explore
And it was lucid in a way homey I didn’t need oars uh-uh
I had a feeling that I’d been there before yo
I hit shore it was shrouded in mist
And in the distance coming in view a primordial forest
A people then approached waving their hands
They were speaking in a tongue I could not understand
They led me though at last to a beautiful fire
And it deepened in a way I forgot I admired
What emerged was more than the wholeness within
I’d seen the men who had been me the beasts I had been

Searching for something
A million miles and a ways to go
Sifting through nothing
The sand you cannot hold

A shaman held a rattle that he started to shake
Anxiety was filling me and was this all a mistake
An elder fell to the ground marking the dirt
He was drawing up a map defining sky and the earth
He pointed to the east, north, west, and the south
And then he pointed to the heavens and he started to shout
The women in the front at once began to chant
While the men beat on drums and the elder man danced

Hidden memories come stealing from my mind

Was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me
And lifted me up with you
So I believe it was a road I was meant to ride

I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore

And pain that's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me
In my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all
But in my dreams parade of lovers
From the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey
And that I've survived the battles
And that my spoils of victory is you

Imagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered 
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
 Y'know? 


We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
'Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin' but you must abandon ship
'Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin' the reverend from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't 'bout talkin' 'bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin' back, for everything you owe


I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'


How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
How do I plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
C'mon!!
Psssh


Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' bout, ""Where is the quaaludes?"" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed ""Nigga motherfucker""
Dropped me to my knees, I proceed to bleed
Sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin'?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option
God damn!
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, repossessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe


I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me

"Motel six, sloe gin fizz
Swinging in the lobby, do the sunset twist
I can do it, you can do it, move them hips
C'mon everybody, get dangerous!

Fellars, if you wanna get that invite quicker
Pack up the pick-up, pick up the liquor
Go on use your charm, so come on, go on get her
It's about time!

Ladies if you really wanna reign them suckers
Line up your lips, plump up your pluckers
It's about the only way to get them motherfuckers
To do what you want to!

It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party

Motel six, you're so sick
Swinging from the ceiling like a front man Rick
Show a little skin for my polaroid pic
Promise I won't show your little girlfriend this!

Ladies, if you really wanna know my secret
Come a little closer, kitty, promise you'll keep it
Come a little nearer, dear, you're gonna need it
Gonna tell you

Men like a woman who just don't need 'em
Sweeter than cherry pie but we'll treat 'em
Meaner than dirt, they deserve to be hurt
'Til they realize what you're worth, worth, worth

It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party

Maybe we can go to the 7-Eleven
Drive down the main drag in your pontiac heaven
You can drink and drive, whatever you want to
And we'll get right down to it, me and you boo

We're layin' on the hood like it's a flatbed truck
In the spotlight we see Jim and Chuck
Saw that car from a mile away and it's slowin'
""They say that there's a motel dance, let's get going.""

Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me 


Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once 
Not tormented, daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom


I'm dying again


I'm going under 
Drowning in you 
I'm falling forever 
I've got to break through

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies

Always confusing the thoughts in my head 
So I can't trust myself anymore

Unbroken chain
Looking for familiar faces
In an empty window pane
Listening for the secret
Searching for the sound
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds
Willow sky, whoa
I walk and wonder why
They say love your brother
But you will catch it when you try
Roll you down the line, boy
Drop you for a loss
Ride you out on a cold railroad And nail you to a cross
November and more
As I wait for the score
They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door
A slow winter day, a night like forever
Sink like a stone, float like a feather
Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the sawhet owl
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the winds howl


Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of shy and sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me

Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring
He's cleaned with the tears
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting-


I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can


I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind
He lives in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine
But I in my leather and lace
I can never become that kind


I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons

No there's no one to name as a traitor here
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year

You can't sleep, you're restless
And slightly obsessed with falling too deep
And malfunction, you're a virus
Whose intention is fucking up something
You're a crater
On the face of a problem much greater
It's the violence or lack thereof control
Body and soul, digging a hole
Is the blood stainless?
Enjoy the pain with accepting the grief
Are you finished?
Dumb fucking question, don't let yourself fall asleep
Resurrect the intention
Once your vision is now mass-produced
Imagine the insults a blessing
Imagine accepting the truth


Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Just imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth


The pendulums swinging
Hypnosis is taking control, now you linger
On a shadow of doubt
Have you really figured what you're all about?
Don't trust your instincts
Just open the chamber where you keep those darkest regrets
All the things you've done wrong
Rebellious at heart all along
Is your leader a voice?
Somehow you've replaced all your gain with a debt
Now the payback's a bitch
Why owe your life to a bitch?
Absolutely pathetic
And regret it when told you are made of mistakes
Imagine the insults a blessing
Imagine accepting the truth


Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth

Get what I want

So when I get it
I make sense of a mysterious thing

An indication of time
Our togetherness
That is how we evolved
We became our needs
Ages up inside
Escaping similar pain
Dreaming safe and secure
Generations in line
Old and then the youth
Come to meet or fade

Built by what we got built for
As much as what we avoid
So the mystery lifts

Hard words is spoken, many promises broken
As if it's, useless to hope, they got me constantly smoking
My role model was a cold bottle of O.E
Surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
I pray to God it ain't easy
Half the cops in California got a hard on to squeeze me
Running through the backstreets, hopping over fences
Tryna shake the fucking K-9s, running around senseless
I'll prolly be a mystery to many, but a legend to some
I've been a man for many women, but husband for none
In case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
My hands, holding my pistols will they serve us or die?
May God forgive me for my crooked ways, I didn't mean it
Knew I'd fall in love with money the first day that I seen it
Maybe now they can understand it's my occupation

Slipped two clips on the table, twist the L and said ""Fatal listen""

On the EastSide of the city, she was working every day
Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake
She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change
And 'cross town she would take the bus at night
To a one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light
She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright
She was waiting on the day she hoped her baby would arrive


She'd never be alone
Have someone to hold
And when nights were cold
She'd say


The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad
If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect, when the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you


They were 90 and were living out their days
On the Westside of the city, next to where they got engaged
They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made
And though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed
With each other, and though some times were hard
Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart
No, they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car
But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart
Even at the end
Their love was stronger than
The day that they first met

If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your lover, and I'll hold your hand

Was just more fuel on the fire

And I think that must be true
Especially when you think of

Its lines and shapes are everywhere
As if they follow me
Repeating my own longing in everything I see

Star of happiness, star of love
Lead us to the shore
That only women hold the promise of
Men would give them money
And men would give them gold
And shower them with promises
Of luxury untold
And make their vessels of creation

Carry me upon your endless depths
And bear my heart above

And I would give her jewels
And lead her to the palace my imagination rules
And fashion from her nakedness

Gone as the time she’s given the suffering of fools

Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise 
My ghetto queen, rise 
Don't be afraid to try 
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We continue growing

Ya'll try not to be anxious and bless our way
Take time, it's gonna take time

It ain't no life without struggling kid
Running, ducking a bid
Feeling like there's nothing to live for

I guess God spared some of us to tell a story
The death of the past is the life of the future

Living in this world of animosity

And I don't wanna be broke no mo
I don't wanna be broke no mo

Get up on your grind
Change the situation
No sense of crime, cause we're all God's child

Direction leading all of mankind
Where there was music and the people who danced
To the players of the singers romance
Receiving messages encoded in rhythm
Encrypted secrets in the beat of the drum


I can't believe in disbelief, but tell me where we are
I've spent lifetimes searching for you
A million years and some tears since I been on the farm
But I've spent way more looking for truth
I come again on the wind, bringing it back to start
What was the dream you told me?
I put together all the memories of a broken heart
About a world so deafening


We met, however unlikely
Came to form a collective psyche
We all have a voice that we have to deny
That'll say I'm not enough and that I need not apply
We redefine the mark of what can be done
We blaze it up and know we don't have to run


I looked up into a sky and it was full of clouds
It's as clear as a photograph
Memories on a breeze, what were they all about?
Every time I see it, I laugh
Abandoned loves and some dreams, it's coming back now
We cannot help but thinking back
It all circles around, I'll nab 'em somehow
As well as looking down the track
What's next?

Between a kick and a cuddle
Get back in the huddle naturally

Going deeper and deeper

They claim that I'm violent
Just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin fits
Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it
Envious because I will rebel against any oppressor
And this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm never ignorant, getting goals accomplished
The underground railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this
My words are weapons, and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you claim that I'm violent



The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin to rob me?""
He had tha nerve to say that I had a curfew
Get out the car, or I'll hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
""What you doin' man?"", They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked, he tried to run
I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped so, I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste of tradin' places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up, now they claimin' that I'm violent



As I was beatin' on the cop, I heard a gun click
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop, now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car, and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start, we in deep shit
So we jumped out
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
Load em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin', then we steppin'
This is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One things fo' sho', tomorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me
Pass me a clip G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin' them a reason 
To claim that I'm violent

Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone


But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk


So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead


But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk


There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us


I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk


Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
""I'll be home so soon, I won't be late""


He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk


'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

Still ain't find all the answers

Watched her fight and beat cancer
Wasn't ready to let me go
I wasn't ready for life without
Fear one day that I'll make that call
I have to face all my darkest doubts
I can scream when I think of what happens for a reason
Find my ways to fly with everyone, I lost when I'm dreaming

I was in Pittsburgh when I saw Superman in the backroom
He was doing lines or something in the bathroom
I barely recognized him at all
I saw him doing things you shouldn't do with all that power
I wish someone would have thrown him in the shower
I barely recognized him at all


That night I put my youth in a casket
And buried it inside of me
That night I saw through all the magic
Now I'm a witness to the death of a hero
I burned all the pictures in the attic
And threw away the magazines
That night I saw through all the magic
And now I'm a witness to the death of a hero


I tried to look away but you can't look away from a trainwreck
The things you said to girls, well they were shameless
I barely recognized him at all
I tried to help but he said he was just too far from saving
And nothing I could say was gonna change him
I barely recognized him at all

Camping out there all night
Just for a chance to see that hair band
Got tickets for my first show
Didn't care about the back row

It was all worth the wait
Never heard nothing so loud
As the roar of the crowd
When the lights went down
And we all pulled 'em all out


Lighter up
Feel the love
Everybody swaying
Ridin' that wave
So alive
With the fire
We raised them high
And burned the night
Lighter up

Hit the stage with that first song
Never felt a groove so strong
Lights were so bright
We were coming alive
The words we didn't know-oh-oh
We all just said who-oh-oh

We started to dance
Never seen nothing like the roar of the flames
She gave me a kiss before she gave me her name




And just like the show-oh-oh
We didn't take it slow-oh-oh
I bathed in her eyes
Even watched the sunrise

I've played every honky tonk and roadside bar and juke joint
Between here and Minneapolis
You know I've lived these miles
There's a haggard man behind these eyes and smile


I picked up the guitar 'round the time I turned fourteen
Lit that fire, been burnin' tires, hard booze, both ends and gasoline
Stayin' wired
Come back down the best that we know how
We know now


We're all tryin' to quit smokin'
Tired of laughin', tired of jokin'
'Bout the habits we all have slowly creepin' up
We all gotta die from somethin'
Livin' kills you, life is tough
But I can't quit 'cause I can't quit enough


I've felt all the pressures playin' to an empty room
And the pleasures of a crowd that's singin' loud to every word to all my songs
But the band and me, Lord, keep rollin' on
We roll on


We're still tryin' to quit smokin'
Tired of laughin', tired of jokin'

Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin razors on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game



 

 




My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin that he tellin get to me, no surprise, nigga



 

 





Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me 
I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
I'm battered and bruised, and madder havin to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin I'm talkin cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin back
From him scrappin when niggas was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

I was silk sheathed in steel

I'd disguise every nerve inside of me

Man, I'd forgotten how to feel

You made me feel so much stronger

This must be magic

You made me feel someone with your love

This must be magic 

This must be love 

This must be magic 

This must be love

I was the hawk not the dove gave up on love

Chasing rainbows, chasing wealth

One angry young man in my own vietnam

At war with the world but just killing myself

You made me feel so much stronger

This must be magic

You made me feel someone with your love

This must be magic

Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky shone most magnificent
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip


And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse

I hear people talking bad
About the way we have to live here in this country
Harping on the wars we fight
And griping 'bout the way things oughta be
And I don't mind 'em switching sides
And standing up for things they believe in
When they're running down my country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me


Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me
Running down the way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song I'm singing be a warning
If you're running down my country, man
You're walking on the fighting side of me


I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims, he just don't believe in fighting
An' I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of living
When they're running down my country, hoss
They're walking on the fighting side of me


Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me
Running down the way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it

Running down the way of life

I said it’s alright, oh yeah
One day it’ll be a good day, for sure
You won’t be alone, always
I’ll be by your side, we’ll be okay
 we’re connected, surely it’ll be brighter tomorrow

As you share happiness, it multiplies
But if you share sadness also, it multiplies too
So always laugh
And rest on my shoulder
We may argue sometimes, but we make up quickly
I understand your feelings too, well~ it’s written on your face
Things like appearance, hmm hmm it’s as if it doesn’t matter
It has no relationship with our “relationship”
It’s fine even if it’s everyday
Showing off at this point, no thanks
Even without money, just seeing you is OK
So don’t worry, let’s laugh again
Yep bro, always the same
Yep bro, by your side
At anytime, we happy together
This unchanging feeling is the same as from back then

I said it’s alright, oh yeah
One day it’ll be a good day, for sure
You won’t be alone, always
I’ll be by your side, we’ll be okay
 we’re connected, surely it’ll be brighter tomorrow

It’s already been three years since we’ve started walking together
Between men, the idea of the “Oath of the Peach Garden”
We’re pretty much family
Like the blood that flows through our bodies
Like “lifting” weight, I’ll “lift” you up**
Laughing with friends until the end of our thoughts
Ma friend, don’t be afraid
The swag amongst those who can hold on to their hope seriously
Ay
Hold up
Grab onto my hand
Let’s fly! We in Gangnam
Now cheers! The Champagne that pops

You can depend on me
You can say “it’s hard”
To me
You can lean on me, lay on me
Lean on me

So laugh, oh yeah
Tomorrow is a new day, that’s why
The night is over, oh yeah
The light is shining in, just go your way

The space between dreams and reality
We keep walking till the end of life
Joy and even pain
If we share it…
I said it’s alright, oh yeah
One day it’ll be a good day, for sure
You won’t be alone, always
I’ll be by your side, we’ll be okay
 we’re connected, surely it’ll be brighter tomorrow

I said it’s alright, oh yeah
One day it’ll be a good day, forever

It's true
That all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman


Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery


Tell me that it's all okay

Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to


Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make-up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this 
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you


But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery


Tell me that it's all okay

Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went

"No I don't believe in love any more
I know now it ain't real
'Cause I've heard people say
No matter what, true love conquers all
And it hurts so bad
I'm here alone

No I don't believe in love any more
You said you'd always be here
And now you're going away
And I can't feel this pain in my heart
And it hurts so bad

Ever since we said, ""It's over""
Are you ever missing me

Baby, did you even love me

Don't even know why I wait up any more
There's no one coming back here
I miss you more each day
And I can't even give you a call
And it hurts so bad
Where did we go

I don't pray of waking up any more
But in the life that I live
I wish my dreams would stay
It's the only world where I'm in your arms
And it hurts so bad
I need to know

Do you ever think of me
Do you think of me
Ever since we said, ""It's over""
Are you ever missing me
Are you missing me
Baby, did you even love me

Wonder what we could have been
Thought this love would last forever
You turned into my best friend
No one living knows me better

And there's nothing I can do

But try to make it through


So baby could you please let me know
 Think of me, think of me
Ever since we said, ""It's over""
 Missing me, missing me
Baby, did you even love me

 Think of me, think of me
Ever since we said, ""It's over""

Screaming on the inside, I am frail and withered
Cover up the wounds, that I can't hide
Walls that lie between us, the saint within the sinner
I have lost the nerve, but it's all right


Carry the wounded and shut your eyes
All will be forgiven, none will rise
Bury the fallen and lead the blind
I will find the lost, dead inside


Into the nothing, faded and weary
I won't leave and let you fall behind
Live for the dying, heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive


Leave me at the bottom, I am lost forever
Letters from the dead say goodbye
Sorrow falls upon us, this will be the last time
Days begin to end, but I'll get by


Follow the hopeless and shut your eyes
All will be abandoned, none will shine
Gather the broken and leave this life
Lying in the earth, side by side




I'll keep you inside
Where I lead you cannot follow
Straight into the light
As my breath grows still and shallow




Stay with me, you're all I have left
I know we can make it out alive

I'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress


I'm coming for your neck, hey, I ain't indirect
They in debt, pay respect, now I'm coming to collect
They regret what they said, that's when I become a threat
Make a bet that the next time you niggas come correct
This the type of music make a nigga flex
Start so gangster, move it throwing up the set
All the pretty niggas feeling only breasts
And the government are cutting only checks
Everybody stressed




If knowledge is power and power is knowledge
And then you divide and conquer, I devoured and conquered
The youth is my environment, inspire responsibly
But they rather drop it like it's hot, that wobbity wobbity
If you ever thought of robbing me, my mob on me probably
I believe this highway robbery, get the fuck out the driver's seat
Honestly part of the problem, you deprived of your privacy
This is private property, you part of the poverty
You forced just like the prophecy, that's part of the policy
Obviously just plain technology, democracy's mockery
My doc made a hypothesis, he said that I'm obsolete
The power of the God in me, no telling what I'mma be

Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame
We always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill
Jovial neighbours come down when they will
With stories to tell
Sometimes they do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do
Our tongues turn blue

Anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing
Everyday in everyway
Sometimes it is spring
Sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing
Sometimes we try
Yes we always try
We have a rocking chair
Somedays we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do
We like the view

Go to the city you'll come back again
To wade through the grain
You always do
Yes we always do
Come back to the stars
Sweet well water and pickling jars

We have a rocking chair
Someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window
Sometimes we do
We wait for you

I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

Just like a blind man I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

Hold it together, birds of a feather
Nothing but lies and crooked wings
I have the answer, spreading the cancer
You are the faith inside me


No, don't leave me to die here
Help me survive here
Alone, don't remember, remember


Put me to sleep evil angel
Open your wings evil angel


I'm a believer, nothing could be worse
All these imaginary friends
Hiding the trail, driving the nail
Hoping to find a saviour


No, don’t leave me to die here
Help me survive here
Alone, don’t surrender, surrender

Open your wings evil angel


Fly over me evil angel

Said you wanted to feel beautiful
And did I ever tell you differently?
I tried to give you all that you deserved
And never mind the things you said to me
Along the way I didn't say all the things I felt inside myself
You took away all that I thought was mine
And then you gave it all to someone else


You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie


Everybody told me I was crazy
But you told me to believe your lies
Guess I was hoping that your love might save me
But I think I died a thousand times
I never knew this side of you
The side that I wish I had never seen
Soon enough I guess I would discover I had a lover that could be so mean

No, I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause the planes keep crashing
Always two by two
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
No, I don't wanna see when the planes hit the ground

I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
Parking their cars in the underground
Their voices when they scream, well, they make no sound
I wanna see the cities rust
And the trouble makers riding on the back of the bus

Dear God, I'm a good Christian man
In your glory, I know you understand
That you gotta work hard and you gotta get paid
My girl's 13 but she don't act her age
She can sing like a bird in a cage
Oh Lord, if you could see her when she's up on that stage!

You know that I'm a God-fearing man
You know that I'm a God-fearing man
But I just gotta know if its part of your plan
To seat my daughters there by your right hand
I know that you'll do what is right, Lord
For they are the lanterns, and you are the light

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Tell me what to say
I'll be your mouthpiece!

Into the light of a bridge that burns
As I drive from the city with the money that I earned
Into the dark of a starless sky
I'm staring into nothing and I'm asking you why:
Lord, will you make her a star?
So the world can see who you really are

Little girl, you're old enough to understand
That you'll always be a stranger in a strange, strange land
The men are gonna come while you're fast asleep
So you better just stay close and hold on to me
If my little mocking bird don't sing
Then daddy won't buy her no diamond ring

Dear God, would you send me a child?
Oh God, would you send me a child?
'Cause I wanna put it up on the TV screen
So the world can see what your true word means
Lord, would you just send me a sign?
'Cause I just gotta know if I'm wasting my time!

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Now the war is won
How come nothing tastes good?

You're such a sensitive child!
Oh, you're such a sensitive child!
I know you're tired but it's alright
I just need you to sing for me tonight
You're gonna have your day in the sun;
You know God loves the sensitive ones

Oh! My little bird in a cage!
Oh! My little bird in a cage!
I need you to get up for me, up on that stage
And show the men that you're old for your age
Now ain't the time for fear
But if you don't take it, it will disappear

Oh! My little mockingbird sing!
Oh! My little mockingbird sing!
I need you to get up on that stage for me, honey
And show the men it's not about the money

Wanna hold a mirror up to the world
So that they can see themselves inside my little girl

Do you know where I was at your age?
Any idea where I was at your age?
I was working downtown for the minimum wage
And I'm not gonna let you just throw it all away
I'm through being cute, I'm through being nice
Oh tell me, Lord, am I the Antichrist?!

I might go down by the bleachers
Just tell me if you see any teachers

And later this ship might eat ya

When you cross my mind i miss ya
I gotta have you in my picture

Please, let out your semen don't let out your demons unless you're prepared for the sequence
Cause love is relentless it kills with no question
It could give a shit bout your defense
You best count your blessings not worry 'bout mentions
You just buildin' up your tension
I'm here to prevent it and lend you my pennies and then take yo ass out to Denny's
Go sip some henny, fuck if she let me, give you a night to remember

No walking away then begging to stay
No letting you go cause this time my heart knows

Spend the whole day hanging with her

Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night

That distant blue, that's me and you
It was from there that we all grew
Framed in space, our first home
All those beating hearts that were made of stone
We were disaster built from flesh and bone


Their bodies made a mountain, a ladder to the stars
When they reached up to the sun, it only left them with scars
All the saints and the sinners will reap what they sow
So they stood back and watched their bitterness grow
They couldn't tell the cure from disease
They no longer knew their want from their need
They fucked the future, forgot the past
Nothing built was built to last
A common ground, now we see
That connected us like the land and the sea

He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop

And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers


It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead
He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn


Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub


When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

There are lights in the clouds

Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me


Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees


Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet

All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

Yeah I've been hurt and I've been blue
And I've been thinking about the changes love has put me through
I've told myself it's got to end
I've had enough and I ain't going back again
I've watched them come
I've watched them go
Six, seven, eight and I can still say no
And then tonight you came along
Only a fool would wanna be that strong


Temptation #9
Make a man wanna cross that line
Face to face with a chance like this
There's only so much that a man can resist


I walked alone, I played it safe
Trying not to count the times I walked away
Because when you love and love goes wrong
A broken heart just seems too much to gamble on
I first saw you, I had to think
Oh another pretty woman just what I don't need
But when I look into your eyes
Hey I see something makes me wanna roll the dice




Ooh you got it shaking
Ooh there's no mistaking
You're the next trip that I'll be taking

For the beast he'll never bind

You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Lady, don't you know we love ya? 
Sweet lady, place no one above ya 
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?


Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Lady, don't you know we love ya? 
Sweet lady, place no one above ya

Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?


Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan

I've bot my pride
I'll walk away and say good bye
If I don't get the love we had before
Not satisfied


So tell me now
Just say the word
It won't be long
I'll be long, long gone

"Trav'ling lady, stay awhile
Until the night is over
I'm just a station on your way
I know I'm not your lover

Well I lived with a child of snow
When I was a soldier
And I fought every man for her
Until the nights grew colder

She used to wear her hair like you
Except when she was sleeping
And then she'd weave it on a loom
Of smoke and gold and breathing

And why are you so quiet now
Standing there in the doorway?
You chose your journey long before
You came upon this highway

Trav'ling lady stay awhile
Until the night is over
I'm just a station on your way
I know I'm not your lover

",['Folk']
"
And you said, ""Don't give me nothing you don't want to lose""
I said ""Darling, I'll give you everything I got if I want, I'm to choose""
Then I got on a plane and flew far away from you
Though unwillingly I left and it was so, so hard to do


The streets here at home had rapidly filled up
With the whitest of snow
And they don't make no excuse for themselves
And there's no need, I know


Now I miss you more than I can take and I will surely break
And every morning that I wake, oh, there's this ache
But there's nothing more to it, I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it, I just get through it


It always takes me by surprise how dark it gets this time of year
And how apparent it all becomes that you're not close, not even near
No matter how many times I tell myself I have to be sincere
I have a hard time standing up and facing those fears


But Frank put it best when he said, ""You can't plan on the heart""
Those words keep me on my feet when I think I might just fall apart


Now I miss you more than I can take and I will surely break
And every morning that I wake, oh, there's this ache
But there's nothing more to it, I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it, I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it, I just get through it


And so I ask where are you now, just when I needed you
I won't ask again, because I know there's nothing we can do
Not now, darling, you know it's true

Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some
But that vibe is non cypher, no can do
And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops...my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!

I'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling 'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear
'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...

About standing up and saying that
It's a tragedy, and such old hat

Summoned the gods and they all agreed
These feet won't stop, they're in such a hurry
Knock it on the head and I go for a curry

Keep on trying to pin me down
Why a title for your sound?

You hear a new song, it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but


Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me


You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you've ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands

"It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
""I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger""

But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
O you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Ah you hate to watch another tired man
Lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder

You tell him to come in sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open, you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger

""Well, I've been waitin', I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waitin' for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this
Or any other matter""
When he talks like this you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this you don't know what he's after

""Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river""
Then he leaves the platform
For the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say, ""Ok, the bridge or someplace later""

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will

I've got some cookies from our junk food run
And here's a couple beers so
Let's go create some fun
Supplies are limited and I'm all out
Of any explanation
Of what I'm on about


I'm tired
Of having to try
To convince you if I
Go along with you it all will
Backfire
I know you had plans
Your intentions were grand
But it's out of my hands
And it isn't the way I pictured it
Either


Well things felt weird but you said that's alright
That it was not a problem
And we could just sit tight
And when you said that I was sure I cringed
'Cause you had no suspicion
That I had come unhinged


Or just tired--
I cannot say which
But there's always a hitch
That will cause the whole thing to
Backfire
I know you had plans
Your intentions were grand
But it's out of my hands now


It's out of my hands now


I know you'd like to be the St. Bernard
Who rushes to the rescue
When there's an avalanche
But in my panic I may pull too hard
And the novice lifeguard
Gets rushed off in the ambulance


I'm tired
I cannot seem to
Get a message to you
That the rescue you planned has just
Backfired
I know you had plans
Your intentions were grand
But it's out of my hands now


It's out of my hands now


And it isn't the way I pictured it

Was young still, scoobed on the skill, the silver plastic
I'm chill, but the females feel I'm still a bastard
It's galactic, studied degrees, about to graft it
Mastered, it bugs me to see all the theatrics
Crafted, set career goals recent surpassed it
Streets reps, left in the stress sleeping in caskets
It's backwards, had to untwist it, uplift it, it helps to grip it

Been designed for the minds with my respect, why object?
So established 80's status, Aziatic
Footwear fanatic, put fear in the average

Hustle mental, to get money, fam, come first
Stay focused, maintain, appreciate patience
Follow the code, stack dough, lay low


Loyalty lay her deep in the roots

Move accordingly, crew all in cahoots

In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me

Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate

You mistook me for a man, that I once knew
You caught me unprepared
That's why on the tide of an ocean of failure
An ocean of love in my heart


Bring me the ship of the seasick sailor
Bring me the keys of the sleeping jailor
Bring me the guns of the war torn soldier
Bury the flag slung over his shoulder

Maybe you could love me again
Maybe you could love me again
Then and only then
Because it hurts to be your friend


The sea is calm
The door is locked
We're safe from harm
The ship is docked
The battle's over
The war is won
Screen fades to black
In a setting sun


Bring me the ship of the seasick sailor
Bring me the keys of the sleeping jailor
Bring me the guns of the war torn soldier
Bury the flag slung over his shoulder

Maybe you could love me again 
Maybe you could love me again 
Then and only then

Because it hurts to be your friend

"Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who waste her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires
Sunrise has gone
Sunrise has gone

Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires

Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it isn't only madmen who listen to fools
""Is this the end?"" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm

Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun

To St. Louis, Missouri

For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want

Gave birth to my brother

Made 'em fight one another
See the pain would never last
Did the best with what they had

As a kid I never knew
I'd have to hustle just to make it through
So I found myself skipping school
Cause the girls don't think I'm cool
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause that's all I ever knew
Telling me I need to slow down
Cause everybody in the whole town
Cause they know how I get down
Foreigner from another town
Can you believe we still around?
After so many hit the ground
And we ain't gone stop now
Until we get that

Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free
Won't stop 'til I find my

If you wanna be free, and the land is drug free
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, from all your misery
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, with plenty money
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, just praise G O D
Put your hands up, put your hands up

You are a hand full of roses
Thorns and a cheap bouquet
True, I'm a walking disaster
They told you to stay away
Seems like I'm making
A deal with the devil
Who's whispering softly to me
""Are you sure that she's the one?""


'Cause I feel
Like a bad joke
Walk the tight rope to hold on to you
Was it real?
Or a love scene
From a bad dream
I don't think I can forget about it


You are a shining example
Of why I don't sleep at all
T-t-t-too many sheep on the brain
To make sense of a late night call
Talking in circles and chasing a tale of
Love-drawn distant memory
Am I sure that she's the one?


'Cause I feel
Like a bad joke
Walk the tight rope to hold on to you
Was it real?
Or a love scene
From a bad dream
I don't think I can forget about it



You know... There are some days when I really feel like this could work; like you and I are finally gonna get it right. Then there are days like today, when you make me wanna tear my fucking hair out


'Cause I feel
Like a bad joke
Walk the tight rope to hold on to you
 was it real?
Or a love scene
From a bad dream
I don't think I can forget about it
I feel just like a bad joke
Woah, gotta know
Was it real?
Waking up from a bad dream
From a bad dream

"In the basement waiting for a statement
But station’s frequency is vacant
Why don’t we go outside
In the break room waiting for a big boom
Smoke haze rising in a big plume
Everyone’s dissatisfied

The pools have dried the trial’s been tried
But the leak’s still spilling they don’t know what to do
The flow won’t stop pressure still won’t drop
Tanks are overfilling

Forward we crawl backwards we fall through the ebb and the flow
Living within a dream wading through the stream beyond the ebb and flow

Up late to earn the proceeds
All stressed out, working until your eyes bleed
Overtime to buy things we don’t need

Always on the go and you’re thirty thirty
Gotta make the ends and get dirty dirty
Will it ever stop will it ever end
Is it worthy

Reality of this is you go loco loco
And too much of this way and you’ll go postal postal
Happens all the time just get in line
And go comatose

The moms and pops have all closed up shop
And who can blame them? I don’t know anyone
The  kids just hide scared to go outside
And just who can blame them?

At times it seems unreal
We can see but we can’t feel
And no one’s at the wheel
Born here all alone
Growing old with hearts of stone
The lights are on but no one’s home

Forward we crawl backwards we fall through the ebb and the flow
Living within a dream wading through the stream beyond the ebb and flow

They won't let us see
What we really are
What's beyond the stars

For though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the sea
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell
Joyful and loving in letting it be

Aye, Calypso, the place's you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well
Aye, Calypso, the place's you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit

Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah


I know you're lying
But sometimes I wanna feel good deep inside it
Hurts so bad but it feels so good I can't deny it
Feels like heaven on earth but the pain exemplifies it
It keeps me quiet
At night when


I love you flaws and all
I need you flaws and all
I'll waste my time flaws and all
I don't mind your flaws at all


I love to fight it
'cause making up makes me forget that I was crying
And breaking up makes perfect sense it sparks the fire
You're such a liar
But you're my sweet desire
And I just can't get enough of your love


I love you flaws and all
I need you flaws and all
I'll waste my time flaws and all
I don't mind your flaws at all


I know you're trying
So I ain't giving up on you I'll wait I promise
'cause I got faith that one day you'll get it together
Ain't nothing perfect but the way you put your loving down on me


I love you flaws and all 
I need you flaws and all 
I'll waste my time flaws and all 
I don't mind your flaws at all 


I love you flaws and all 
I need you flaws and all 
I'll waste my time flaws and all
I don't mind your flaws at all

Pretty enough for you

But it's not worth it to you

Is it destruction that you require to feel
Like somebody wants you

3 p.m., on my feet and staggering
Through misplaced words and a sinking feeling
I got carried away
Sick, sick of sleeping on the floor
Another night, another score
I'm jaded, bottles breaking


You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times, let's face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella, would you take me home?
Stella, would you take me home?


2 a.m., I'm on a blackout binge again
You know I don't need sleep and I lost my keys
But I've got so many friends
And they keep, keep me coming back for more
Another night, another score
I'm faded, bottles breaking


You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times, let's face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella, would you take me home?


One more reason I should never have met you
Just another reason I could never forget you
Down we go, the room's spinning outta control
Lose myself in a chemical moment
Night life's taking its toll
That's just the way it goes, come on
Stella, would you take me home?

Yeah and he was the poet of the Lone Star state

To think I was good enough to be his opening act
And in a cloud of smoke he took another toke
And counted one, two, three
And I knew right there just breathing his air
What I wanted to be

Mothers who had raised a son so well
Talking outlawed, long hair loners and stoners
Singing about to come back home and

Floating over a sea of vodka
Separated from the rest
Fights problems with bigger problems
Sees the ocean fall and rise
Counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her
Water pouring from her eyes
Alcoholic and very bitter


For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help until you start


We knocked another couple back
The dead soldiers lined up on the table
Still prepared for an attack
They didn't know they'd been disabled
Felt a wave, a rush of blood
You won't be happy 'til the bottle's broken
You're out swimming in the flood
You kept back, you kept unspoken


For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help you until you start


You got a look in your eye
When you're saying goodbye
Like you wanna say hi


The light was on but it was dim
Revolver's been turned over
And now it's ready once again
The radio was playing 'Crimson and Clover'
London Bridge is safe and sound
No matter what you keep repeating
Nothing's gonna drag me down
To a death that's not worth cheating

If I should die before I wake

Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven
Forgive me for my sins, let me into Heaven

I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears


Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed

To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?

Wonder why as I walk by

This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison

There's glimpses of heaven in every day

A witch hunt for an exit

Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless
Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die
I can't fear death, no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell


Throw me to the flames!
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze!
Watch me burn


How are we on a scale of one to ten?
Could you tell me what you see?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
Have you been skipping meals?
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?


Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me

"Qualcuno dice
Che quando fai l'amore
Tu sei uno schianto
E che nessuno piu di te
Conosce bene i trucchi
Del piacere
Ma qualcosa in te non va
Quando mi tocchi cosi
Mi sciolgo per te

Ti attorcigli a me
Travolto dalla tua, passione folle
Che riesce a rapirmi ma...
Ma non del tutto...

Mi accorgo che
Mentre comprendo quel qualcosa cos'e

If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you


They thought I only rapped about murder and pistols 
I'm tryna feed my family, I ain't being political
You ain't givin' out money, then they look at you pitiful 
You make a couple million, niggas greedy, they envy you 
Ayy, fuck that other side, we gon' shoot up your Sprinter
I used to sell that crack and spray that MAC out that rental
Niggas run and hide when we roll down the window
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he can't wait 'til December
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he gon' shoot you on camera
Lost his faith in Jesus Christ, he prayin' to a bandana
Police gunned his brother down, this shit too hard to handle
Loadin' up his chopper , he gon' show 'em black lives matter


Another nigga made the news, it ain't nothin' new 
He done dropped outta school, it ain't nothin' new
He done got his first tool, it ain't nothin' new
Mama on that dog food, it ain't nothin' new
He smokin' weed and he changin', it ain't nothin' new
All his friends gang-bangin', it ain't nothin' new
Got a pocket full of hundreds and they all blue
Another nigga from the hood tryna ball, too 


Shit gettin' outrageous
Treat us like slaves then they lock us up in cages
Young, black, poor, ain't had a father since a baby
Why you think we skip school and hang out on the pavement?
Why you think we ridin' 'round with choppers off safety?
Streets cutthroat, nigga, so I'm cutthroat
I used to sell dope, nigga, now I can't vote
Poppin' Percocets to kill the pain, I can't cope
Anger in my genes, they used to hang us up with ropes
Civil rights came so they flood the hood with coke
Breakin' down my people, tryna kill our faith and hope
They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke
Welcome to the hood, yeah where niggas dyin' at
Same place where the best chicken gettin' fried at
Same place where the police killin', tellin' lies at
It ain't just the babies, man, I swear their mamas cryin' now

Fuck everything and bust a nut

So I can pick me up about sixty bucks worth of sticky nugs
Just a quick re-up, then I'm up, up, and away

His lungs collapse on the side of his guitar
Regrets with nothing left so far

Trying to play Prince Charming
When he's dying within
Tells himself he gotta be real
Tells himself he's going to steal the scene

Whether he's messing around or he's serious

And all the love that we made
It never shoulda took place

You betrayed and I know
I should have let you go
Cause I'm back where I was before, baby




Look

Though we go through trials and tribulations, yes

And I've stressed you out
And really get you fed up
I ain't never never gonna let up
Unless it makes you happy for me to shut up
But I ain't shutting up, because I really wanna give it to you
I can't replace the feeling when we get it with each other
And I ain't trying to lose you

Come on, maybe we can spend some time together

Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows

Enter the risen Osiris, risen again

All around is laid waste
And in my last hour

When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and

For He is a man and a God
And He will die too

For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell

Io non so parlar d'amore
L'emozione non ha voce
E mi manca un po' il respiro
Se ci sei c'è troppa luce
La mia anima si spande
Come musica d'estate
Poi la voglia sai mi prende
E si accende con i baci tuoi


Io con te sarò sincero
Resterò quel che sono
Disonesto mai lo giuro
Ma se tradisci non perdono
Ti sarò per sempre amico
Pur geloso come sai
Io lo so mi contraddico
Ma preziosa sei tu per me


Tra le mie braccia dormirai
Serenamente
Ed è importante questo sai
Per sentirci pienamente noi
Un'altra vita mi darai
Che io non conosco
La mia compagna tu sarai
Fino a quando so che lo vorrai


Due caratteri diversi
Prendon fuoco facilmente
Ma divisi siamo persi
Ci sentiamo quasi niente
Siamo due legati dentro
Da un amore che ci da
La profonda convinzione
Che nessuno ci dividerà


Tra le mie braccia dormirai
Serenamente
Ed è importante questo sai
Per sentirci pienamente noi
Un'altra vita mi darai
Che io non conosco
La mia compagna tu sarai
Fino a quando lo vorrai

Di amore e di fiducia
Poi sarà quel che sarà

If I ever go broke, I'ma kick in your door, waving the four
Screaming ""Get the fuck on the floor, and gimme the raw!""
Listen, killing rap niggas wasn't part of the plan
It's the way these niggas talk man, they forcing my hand
I'm the same over beats, as I am on the streets
If I have to, I'll kill a motherfucker to eat
I got gats, clips, chips, whips
Bricks to flip, and a flow that's sick
My rhyming time is precise like I'm doing the heist, I'm nice
Get out of line and you'll get sacrificed like Christ
Look at these fake playa niggas fronting like they macking
Drop the ""m"" off of macking, then you have it they acting
In Queens we got lil' niggas running around packing
Not little guns, this shit is bigger than Pun
Let me find out you thinking about thumping with me
The pussy club on your nine won't rump with me


Now that Martin Luther King know his time was short, being pro-black
Turn the other cheek, nigga hold that
It's gain my niggas respect, it's V-I-O-
L-E-N-C-E is what I be when I see my foes
It's automatic, anytime, anywhere, grizzly bears
Shots going off, kids get scared
I go from Queensbridge to park slow. Across the world
Leaving trails of hoes that got they heart broke
I puff the dark smoke, usually, mix it with greens, look what it do to me:
Have me fucked up before puberty
If I had one wish and the shit'll come true
A nigga live to be a hundred and two
All I need is a two-pay, call it a new day
Immigrant prostitutes like ""papa how much you pay?""
Got to lose weight, niggas say I'm way too big
Bad habits, call a shop, and stay way too jigg, motherfucker

Sprinkle a little 2Pac on it

They call me Ferrari they call me 50
Call me big homie
Hah


I got a bad bitch over the crib, I'm finna pop her off
Nigga call me in 30 I beat her and dropped her off
It's a quickie the ass and the lips are super soft
And to top it off, she topped me off
Niggas trynna front on my swag, knock it off
Put the strap to the back of your knot and knock it off
Homicide they have to come through, block it off
That's what they do after that choppa get to choppin' off 
They say a nigga off, and think a nigga off
I'm on the runway one way takin' off
I tell a chick, pay a pimp, bitch, break it off
I smack a ho, that ain't shit bitch, shake it off 


Off and on, these niggas be off and on
And it go 
And it go 
Off and on, me, I'm never off, I'm on
And it go

Go 'head and ask about 50's Ferrari, I never take a loss
I'm a boss, tell niggas to let it off, set it off
Diamond cloth, plush lawn, it's floss at all costs
God damnit it all costs, get it now, half off 
Diamond stud show off, nigga's swag is so off
They stunt till I go off, the 6 hour blow off
My wahi mahi-mahi teriyaki I'm so cocky
Who the fuck out here to stop me, nigga haters sit and watch me
And it seem like it is but it's not the same man niggas ain't got what I got my man
Got a flow so pure like brick cocaine nigga bitch wanna be my secret man
Freaky thing you eat that thing, every now and then I beat that man
She tell a nigga not to say a thing, but I can't keep a secret man

We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt

Down by the river on a Friday night

Talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Dropped her off early but I didn't go home

At the ripe age of 24, I done seen it all, done it all
Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled
Dealin' with time, winter, spring, summer, fall
It's crazy changes, is this that made me famous?
I come a long way from Timbs, minimum wages
Stockin' caps, summer jobs, pockets flat
It's funny how my childhood idols now be coppin' crack
I ain't knockin' that, unfortunately, life's too short to see
It's only right we move accordingly at every second
I use to carry heavy weapons
Previously cocked, tucked in my shirt for every session
But hold up, a 2-6 bid made me grow up
Came home to the same damn dreams with no luck
And half the clique's strong, the other half moved on
Some with new lives and new wives, niggas live long
The foulest thing about time - it still ticks when you gone


For those who live the way I live, we came a long way
From wipin' cold outta eyelids to rap's hottest
Smokin' lye, let track guide us
Remember back then before MAC-10's, expensive bottles?
Had a sick mind, niggas taught me how to get mine
We'd often sip quarts, they get tossed at the spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to gip for their time
While we plan to live forev', he had a different design
Is it safe to say, we all perish on the sacred day?
With my luck, soon as I reach the gate, they make me pay
Pray, minutes go by, Indigo high
The specialist, decked out dark specs, finessin' it
Used to play catch-a-kiss, same girls back then
Now, leave us messages, a whole lot
Travel to my old spot where we sold rock, although it's trifle
Ain't nothin' changed, just like time, it's all a cycle


Yo, wake up to the world, stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision, focus, get wise, enlargen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark is unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first skid bid, nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game
Love the night rain, found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, it's all a race to the top
Tryin' to freeze time, that's why I iced the face of my watch

Hidden by the stormy light
A battle rages for the right
For what will become

In the valley of the damned
A warrior with sword in hand
Travels fast across the land
For freedom he rise

And the sign from the master on high
He screams aloud and across hear the cry
For the kingdom of fire and ice
And the power to be alive

Be strong, ride on carry on through the war
Come along, carry on living for evermore

On the wings of death
By the hands of doom
By the darkest light
From the darkest moon

Crossing silent seas
Over mountains high
All will stand as one tonight

On the black wind forever
We ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom my guide
When the master will call us
He stands high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

In the valley of the damned
Day breaks with golden strand
Over pastures green it glows
To where night returns

In the shadows faces appear
Warriors wearing full metal gear
Join together one and all
Before the glorious light

Rise up gather around come and hear what is said
Use your senses open your mind don't you ever forget

On the wings of life
By the hands of hope
By the brightest light
From the brightest sun
Crossing silent seas
Over mountains high
To the valley of the damned

On the black wind forever
We ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom my guide

Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

How the hell did I get home? 
Did he drive me?
Drop me off got his stuff and got gone
Can't call my homies
'Cause I'm looking and I just can't find my phone
I need to talk to somebody
Something I did made my baby go away


Got the same clothes on today
That I had on yesterday
What did I do? What I say?
Man, I don't remember
Guess I had too much to drink
'Cause I don't remember


Is he gone forever?
Man, I don't know
I just don't remember


Ohh, ohh
Wish I could play back from beginning to the end
I think we started dancing
I kinda remember a kiss 
With a cute bartender
With the remy and the henny and the coke and gin
'Cause I'm not a drinker
Caught in the moment my baby got away


Got the same clothes on today
That I had on yesterday
What did I do? What I say?
Man, I don't remember
Guess I had too much to drink
'Cause I don't remember


Is he gone forever?
Man, I don't know
I just don't remember


Ohh
Baby, so intoxicating, had enough
Oh, conversation
Too much drinking, having fun
What was I thinking?
Just celebrating
Ohh, please forgive me
Baby, I just don't remember

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here


Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here


I'll be over here
I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

It feels so worn being chained here to this life
I've been around and seen one hundred scenes
Where those who dare to tread the wheel
One day find out what's behind that hill

Spend half a life deciding what went wrong
Trying to find out what took you so long
Until you feel it's all part of some crazy scheme
It conjures in your memories 'til
You discover what's behind that hill

You picked me up and we went for a drive
Into the stained glass cavern of the night
You turn to say, your eyes fixed on the rows
Take me from this place I know
The ruined landscapes that I once called home

I don't know what in this world is trying to save me
But I can feel its hand and it's guiding me in sign
From lives I've tried to lead
To the one that I received
Each painted sign along the road
Will melt away in source tags and in code

And sweetly sang an old melody

Her eyes told more than words e'er could say
I told her I had to go, left her down in Mexico

You can call your girls, I'ma call my boys
I'm choosing them tonight and you're my choice 
Come on 


Girl, the club about to close, come over here 
Right now I'm headed to my car then to the crib 
And baby, we can leave pronto , going to my condo 
You gon' black out when I
Throw your back out, out, out 

Throw your back out, out, out

Throw your back out, out, out 

Throw your back out, out, out 

Throw your back out

"I never thought that I would see these days
There's no more sunlight and it's always raining on me
The struggles I face try to strip me of everything
I am barely standing, still there is no peace
You promised me that I wasn't alone
But everywhere I turn it seems like I stand on my own
It seems so pointless; is this existence meaningless?
Is there any hope left for me?

I am completely broken
I am your forgotten son
You left me with nothing
My hands are so tired and so worn
I was always hoping that I could find some peace
But what I always find is that nothing's changing
God, nothing is changing

I am bearing witness to my multitude of sins
These days and nights seem like they will never end
There is no rest or hope in sight
There is nowhere that I can hide
The emptiness that haunts my days is there when I close my eyes

My depravity has taken hold of all I am
It has consumed me to the point I cannot stand
It brings me to my knees
Still I find nothing is changing
God nothing is changing

I am asking myself if there is a point to all this searching?
I feel like there is something I've been missing

I am bearing witness to my multitude of sins;
Is there and hope left for me?

Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
Before I found you


Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only


Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
I'm living ultralife
I'm living ultralife


Turn down the voice inside my head
Cos heaven only knows why we feel this emptiness
But I will climb out, find another view
Now I've found you


Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only


Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife




Found me on a basement floor 
Back when I had lost it all 
Told me what the fight was for 
And I'm not giving up no more 
You elevate the life in me 
Illuminate the in-between 
Forever gonna feel this free 
And I'm not giving up now


Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
But now I've found you


Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun

Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within a mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight


Yeah, back my lines of a linebacker
Every song I hit, you gon' need a chiropractor, when you're spine's fractured
Far as the  rap scene, I'm a vital factor
You challengers ain't prepared for the title match-up
I got an idol stature, so if I catch ya
And  snipers shootin' rifles atcha
That's it, the final chapter, your book is over
Gained full speed in the game and took it over
I'm the reason whoever leadin' is lookin' over
Their shoulder, they slowin' down and they lookin' older
And my mind's at a veteran stage
It make 'em sick when I tell 'em my age
Homie, I run this town, like the mayor in  truck
Yep, catch up, playa, I been about bucks
Soundwave all-star, starter for the champagne
Stop hatin' and be a part of the campaign


Is who's gon' run this town tonight


Yeah, D-Pryde
I feel the rush from the crowd, feelin' extra fly
, we run it, you better recognize
All these rappers sound identical; Gemini
When you see the squad peel off like a clementine
You never gettin' pride, that ain't an option, pal
In the zone and I own it, I got a proper sound
I'm known as cocky now, but in this game
When the people see I'm modest, they honestly come and knock ya down
Get a check, I'm not an amateur, yo
I'm the same, never change when the cameras close
Tryin' not to get hurt,  threats worse
Sayin' that you run homie, ask for my consent first
W'sup


Tra-phic
So funny how the haters tell you, ""You lose""
But every day they try to watch me up on YouTube
Tryin' to bite my style, smile and their tooth loose
Used to call me Gin, now they don't; I'm that new juice
Click on my face, add the MySpace
Everybody hatin', but I'm eatin' good on my plate
And this the new RatPack, I do it my way
What you think I rap for? To only get like 5 plays?
Bitch, you can check my statistics
I'm workin' to the bone like a shirt from the Misfits
If you don't like this, you can Google it
Too hot, big in the  Ramen Noodle shit
What the future holds, only the Lord knows
I snatch the mic like  at award shows
But hold on, I'ma let you finish your rhyme
But this collaboration is the greatest of all time


Is who's gon' run this town tonight


We are, yes I said it, we are
This is Ahmirica, pledge your allegience
Make sure you're hearin' us, we gon' get what we want
One day they'll look back and figure out how we won


One

Of the few groups on the scene where every member can sing

Two

Much determination, we hustlin'  'til we reach that dream

Three

We got the internet game on lock, that's why you watchin' us bring

Four

Vocalists, one manager, one engineer on this dream team
So...


Give death to the auto-tune
That'll make our competition's lack of skills audible
Ay, I scratch my head to the follicle
Could it be we have no competition? That's plausible

So consider this  to you
We gon' keep doin' what we was gonna do
We got the drive and the fortitude
You can keep talkin' 'cause Ahmir is ignorin' you


Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within a mile
Almost there, don't give up now

When we shadow the sun
When we surrender to violence, oh

Put away that gun

Drop that ass, to the music, liquor made you do it

It's automatic, that pussy drippin', check the fluid
Making it rain 
Have a shower on me, oh
Girl, come get it, baby, go crazy
And work me all night, night, go, girl, ayy
Girl, you know you bad, bad, bad, bad 
But what you gon’ do with all of that, that, that, that?
Whine up on it, do your dance, dance, dance, dance
This was all a part of the plan 


Girl, I'm getting high while she take it low 
I might throw that cash on the floor
I'm getting  high while she take it low

Low cut, see-through shirts that make ya 
That’s the way she come through like

Just set them up to knock them down

Without leaving my fingerprints out

Hop out that bitch, it's looking like I write checks

Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind

The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders

If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, ""Come and see."" And I saw, and behold a white horse


There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around


Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks


Till Armageddon no salam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around


Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundred weight and penny pound
When the man comes around


And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts. And I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and hell followed with him

Let’s turn this house into a happy home




Now we've been kickin' it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin' Alize and Cristal, wildin' every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin, you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or ho'
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home


Let's stick together, forever
To make a happy home


Together, forever
To make a happy home




Born through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin' you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin' and talkin', a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin' hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home


Let's stick together, forever
To make a happy home

"You're through gestation so welcome to the world
We've still got vacancies just waiting to be filled
We're still delivering ten thousand souls a day
And disproportionately packing them away

The starving of the multitudes and the feeding of the few
We're only humanoid there's nothing we can do
You must do something or we'll all go up in smoke
We'd like to help but we're afraid of losing votes

They never listen to you
They never listen to your cries
We're not progressing we're only marking time
You're on your own

Think of your children
Think of your children
Are they welcome to the world?

If every Chinaman jumped up and down in sync
Then California would be sucked into the drink
You've all got bodies and a few of you got minds
We'd like to juse them but we never get the time

Though man's achievements are a credit to us all
How come we're stading with our backs against the wall?
One thousand congressmen assemble every day
They'll send us packing on a dreadlock holiday

They'll never listen to you
They'll never listen to your cries
They'll keep on talking and wasting precious time
You're on your own

Think of your children

Look to your children
They're only children
Are they welcome to the world?

Telling another tale of the American dream

Watching from the floor

Never settle down

Always wanting more

I mistook the warnings for wisdom
From so called friends quick to advise
Though your touch was telling me otherwise
Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh but I was just young, I was scared, I was wrong


Not a night goes by
I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
And I listened to my pride
When my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home


Guess I did what I did believing
That love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore than never knowing


Not a night goes by

When my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been

Just a place to run when my working day is through
They say home is where the heart is
If the exception proves the rule I guess that's true

Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go


We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
He could control our sense of time
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
Everyone was in peace of mind


We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
Just seemed to vanish in thin air


He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free...oh they're free


We are lost above
Floating way up high

You can surely try

And aha, I think you're late now let me see your tickets!
Aha, if you crash, you might get afflicted
I don't know where you been at, slowing down the seat belt!

Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
So, so


My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments, basements
Garbage, vacant lots, garages, spaces
Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceship
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh


I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray to Lord my soul to keep


Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Them boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
Used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be, a whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I'd give 
So


Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong


I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
So, so


Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong

I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away

You know my love will not fade away

My love is bigger than a cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel

Our love is real, not fade away

I can barely see you when I close my eyes
There's nothing left of you here

Things that we remember and do not regret
They don't mean a thing here

I'll be your guide so you can see
The other side and I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your head so you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping to never let you get away
Never let you get away


Everything you prayed for is not overhead
No one else will save you
Make up your mind, make up your mind
Trust me when I tell you we are on our own
Overlap our fingers
And run to ground, we’ll run to ground

Moonshine  on the bayou
Love shrine , break the taboo
I wanna know what's in your potion
Bound by total devotion


I was looking for love all over
You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a love hangover
I try to leave, but I have to stay


Because it's voodoo, voodoo, voodoo 
Because it's voodoo, voodoo, voodoo 


Swamp sings over the bazaar
Snake bites, aligning stars
I'm enraptured, there is no cure
No sanctuary from your allure

You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a love hangover
I try to leave but I have to stay


Because it's voodoo, voodoo, voodoo 
Because it's voodoo, voodoo, voodoo 


Because the voodoo that you do is all that you can do
To make me into your fool
Because when you do your voodoo
I'm just like a doll that your pins keep pushing into
So every time I try to break this trance
I'm just so afraid I'll miss my chance
To be bewitched by the bayou
I just gotta say I want your hex
I don't wanna live without your hex
I'm so obsessed with your sexiness

"Hey, you!


Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes, not
Puts me down, fool me around
Why she do it to me?
Out for satisfaction, any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be


She needs lovin'
Knows I'm the man
She's gotta see
Pours my beer
Licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me


Hell ain't a bad place to be


Spends my money, drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinking, ""Hey, just a minute
Something ain't right""
Disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
All the same, you playin' your games
Tellin' me those lies


Don't mind her playing demon
As long as it's with me
If this is hell, then let me say
It's heavenly

Turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart
Tears it apart

Every chick I fuck with is a dime

Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya

As he stood there trembling and turning pale

Sort of like Jacob Marley's chain

But it's not like life's such a vale of tears
It's just full of thoughts that act as souvenirs
For those tiny blunders made in yesteryear
That comprise Jacob Marley's chain

Well, I had a little metaphor to state my case
It encompassed the condition of the human race
But to my dismay, it left without a trace
Except for the sound of Jacob Marley's chain

Now there is no story left to tell
So I think I'd rather just go on to hell
Where there's a snowball's chance that the personnel
Might help to carry Jacob Marley's chain

I was raised in the valley, there was shadows and death
Got out alive but with scars, I can't forget
This kid back in school, subdued and shy
An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes
I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die
Took a boy to the forest, slaughtered him with a scythe
Stamped on his face, an impression in the dirt
Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?


We all have our horrors and our demons to fight
But how can I win when I'm paralysed?
They crawl up on my bed, wrap their fingers 'round my throat
Is this what I get for the choices that I made?
God, forgive me for all my sins
God, forgive me for everything
God, forgive me for all my sins
God, forgive me; God, forgive me


Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Don't go, I can't do this on my own

I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight
Don't go
Don't go


If I let you in, you'd just want out
If I tell you the truth, you'd vie for a lie
If I spilt my guts, it would make a mess we can't clean up
If you follow me, you will only get lost
If you try to get closer, we'll only lose touch
Yes, you already know too much and you're not goin' anywhere


Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much
Tell me that you love me 'cause I need you so much
Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much
Say you'll never leave me 'cause I need you so much

Watch all those late shows on TV
I like it best when you're in here with me

And all the lost boys
We make a picture perfect team
Bruising sidewalks
With all the drumming of our feet
And boy, I promise
We'll never ever let you leave
Never let you leave

I don't wanna smoke, I don't need a drink
Just tell me how you feel, tell me what you think
'Cause I've been on my own for a fuckin' while
And I don't need a girl, I just wanna smile
Gettin' my mind right, I wait 'til the time's right
I'm meanin' to tell you why it's hard to sleep at night
There's nothin' to fear now, we should be here now
Why don't you hear me out?


'Cause talk is overrated, let's just vibe
And love is overrated in my mind
Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe
Just for tonight


I've been hella stressed, I would rather chill
I know you look to me, wonder how I deal
But look inside my soul, I don't mean to front
'Cause really I don't know what the fuck I want
I remember when we were more than friends
I would just pretend, that was cold
After all this shit, I could not let you in
Summer went, saved up all the money
That I would have spent on you

My friends are degenerates
But I'd never change them
Liars, cheats, and hypocrites
Not the type for savin'


Why do we tend to hurt one another?
Dividin' up all the books by the covers
Like it ain't hard enough simply bein' me

Or could I sum you up just by what I see?


In reality, everyone's a lot more complicated


My friends are degenerates

Sold all your empathy, tell me what it cost

Back when I was just a kid
Skin was paper thin
Folded up like origami
Turned the sensitivity in me into an army
Standing at the castle walls that stood before me
I couldn't climb until I learned to let the people in
Even though it hurt me, lit the fire from within
Made me feel like I can make it through anything
No matter what they bring, tell me that I'll never win


Everything I need is right in front of me
I wanna bridge the gap and feel the unity
Yeah, everything I need is in the air I breathe
You get back what you give, and I was born to live, born to live


I know all that you've been through
Feeling like you might not make it alone
'Cause I have walked a mile in your shoes
Yeah, I know all that you
I know all that you've been through


I wanna see the empire fall
Before I go, I wanna see justice for 'em all
I wanna see my daughters get married
But I can't if I'm in the cemetery
I can hear it when it calls
The call of the void I'll avoid til the very end
'Til the bad guys lose and the good guys win
'Til the grabbers lose their grip, ripped from under my skin
I'ma take a deep breath


Everything I need is right in front of me
I wanna bridge the gap and feel the unity
Yeah, everything I need is in the air I breathe

Pull the covers tight, the world could be freezing

Hoping they can see beyond the grey skies

And my emotional stability is leaving me

A sea was storming inside of me

This is for my sister
She fresh off of the bus
Can't lie I really missed her
I'm glad she came back to us
Left home with a early mind state
Family life turned sideways
90's had a higher crime rate
There's a whole lot to discuss
Broken families caused casualties
So the offspring formed their own thing
It's a gangster party now west side of town
In the rider now what you think
Putting in work, piece in her purse
And she got hands make her feel her hurt
But lighten up the mood
Respected by the dudes
Living in the dark but lightens up the room



In and out
Straight from the bottom now to the top
Do you believe that I'm here to stay
I will not turn no I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay



Now my sister went from
Trapping and robbing too
Who wanna problem, you?
We can resolve it
She can recall
The day she had her first born
For a moment felt so transformed
Single mother with her heart torn
Not sure what she should do
Why call it crime, they became the hustle tho
Hard to be living all kinds of broke
Check fraud was the best job
For somebody who ain't had they diploma
That came along with prison time
Hard drugs missing line
Her mind before she could realise
A decade went by of missing time



In and out
Straight from the bottom now to the top
Do you believe that I'm here to stay
I will not turn no I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay



Now I done seen her come in and out
Several times been to prison now
This time, claims it's different now
Coz she's chosen to go a different route
Well aight, we gone see
I be sceptical man that's me
What unfolded right before my eyes
These past eighteen months could only be described
As a move of God
She's finally free
Been sober for like two years now
Ain't even tempted to smoke weed
And the scales finally fell from her eyes
She did the work coz she recognised
Everything she lost she get it back
Reconciled with every one of her kids in fact
They love her as a mom
Happy to meet the siblings
They never knew existed
She continues building this life for herself
While I just wanna spoil my niece with attention, joy in my world
Happy her and Levi would grow up together
Holidays and road trips can't get any better
Tryna think how I can get my sister involved
Coz she's way more than just my sister in law
She reminds me why I've been doing this all
Impressing to the Lord even though it's been hard
And who would have thought such inspiration
Would come from a life that's been so tainted
It's been hard yeah we know it's true
But God takes our crooked sticks and makes em adjacent
Puts people in our lives for motivation
From unlikely places
This Is my thank you



In and out

I will not turn no I'm here to stay

You tell me of a place you like to go
You say it will reach out and seize the sorrow
And we always mean to act on what we say
So come on, oh darling, now hurry hurry lets go


We're all we need
Oh darling
Hey we're all we need
Oh darling
Hey we're all we need
Oh darling
Hey we're all we need
Ohoh darling


I told you of a place that I had been
It was dark and I was supremely alone
No matter now if the compass fails again
Cause in your love I built a home


We're all we need
Oh darling
Hey we're all we need

I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths

Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene


Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh


In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean

Your sweet insanity is whispering in my ears
And you speak of honesty by lying to yourself


So tell me, do you know any more good stories?
Which role should I play?
And I can be the least of all of your worries
How often can you say


Believe me, I'm so sorry
But the truth is, I'm not a part of your story


My world is incomplete
And you've been filling in the gaps with lies
And we're all just characters
You've written between the lines

Where I've fallen at your feet
My world is incomplete
While you get back on your feet


Hanging from this framework of good stories
And making your own moral categories
However, the wreckage that you leave
I've proven to myself that I am very naive


I just didn't wanna know
The large gift of your narrative skill
More than anything I get to know
I get to know that words can kill
Hanging from this framework of good stories
Of double meanings and parallel worlds
Against a wall where souls are hurled

Damned if I do and bored if I don't
No winners in this race

Welfare


A hard sacrifice
I wanna testify, staying a loving man
Society gave me no choice, tried to silence my voice
Put my woman on the welfare

I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying to prove
My equal rights
Though I've made some mistakes
For goodness sakes
Why you gonna keep messing up my life?


Keep away from me, Mr. Welfare
Keep away from me, keep away, keep away
Mr. Welfare
Ohhh


Holding me back, using your tax
To make me kneel against my will
That's how it go
Why, I don't know, I don't believe
This life's for real
Like the private eye for the FBI
Just as envious as the Klu Klux Klan
Though I'm a passing fate
And I'm trying to escape
I got to do what I think I can


Keep away from me, Mr. Welfare
Didn't you hear me, don't come near me, babe
Mr. Welfare, Mr. Welfare

They wanna say I'm a lazy man
But you got to understand
There's a thing about my pride
You can't make me move
If there ain't no groove
Because it eats me all up inside


Welfare

Just another day, trying to make a way
All I see outside of me is crime
What can I do to make it through
Ain't gonna say nobody's crying
I got a woman, true
And a baby too
With a love that grows and grows and grows
Here come the bills, there go the thrills
And a job, all doors are closed


Keep away from me, Mr. Welfare

Keep away from me, Mr. Welfare man

They wanna say I'm a lazy man

"Well I left my happy home to see what I could find out
I left my folk and friends with the aim to clear my mind out
Well, I hit the rowdy road and many kinds I met there
Many stories told me of the way to get there
So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know, and I’m on the road to find out

Well in the end I’ll know, but on the way I wonder
Through descending snow, and through the frost and
Thunder
I listen to the wind come howl, telling me I have to hurry
I listen to the robin’s song saying not to worry
So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know, and I’m on the road to
Findout

Then I found myself alone
Hoping someone would miss me
Thinking about my home
And the last woman to kiss me, kiss me
But sometimes you have to moan
When nothing seems to suit yer
But nevertheless you know
You’re locked towards the future
So on and on you go
The seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know
And I’m on the road to findout

Then I found my head one day when I wasn’t even trying
And here I have to say, ’cause there is no use in lying, lying
Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil’s sin, pick up, pick up a good book now
Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?

Che finira la storia

La storia di questo mondo
Che comincio in una valle
Ouel giorno quando l'uomo fu inventato era un uomo perfetto

E era uno bellissimo
Stupendo come chi lo creo

Passeggiava e saltellava nel creato
Che per lui era in festa

In un'eterna primavera dove il sole non tramonta mai
E tutti gli animali
Tutti gli animali poi giocavan con lui
E nei limpidi ruscelli nuotavano d'argento
I pesci insieme a lui

Poi lui col suo cavallo bianco cavalcava tra Ie valli dorate

Sfrecciando fra i colori indescrivibili dipinti dal sole

Che scolpivano nell'aria il suo bel corpo

E lo tingevan d'aurora

E la natura
Che splendeva rispecchiava la sua forza in lui
E nel ventre di una donna lui la rigenerava in un grande amor

E da questo grande amore incomincio
La storia dentro il ventre suo

E lei che fu la prima
Che nessuna come lei

Fu cosi bella in tutti i tempi

Fu proprio dal suo ventre che sgorgarono

Tutti quanti i popoli
Ma e una fonte che
Che sta per finire

Che sta proprio per finire
Oramai non c'e piu amor
Oramai non c'e piu amor

Non c'e piu amor !

E qui regna solo l'indifferenza

Che e peggiore e piu mortale di qualsiasi bomba atomica
E nelle vostre vene scorre I'infezione di quest'aria ormai

Che distrugge i sentimenti lasciandovi
Nel petto un cuore arido

E il seme della vita
Che avete dentro
Il vostro vecchio corpo

E quasi morto
E presto lo vedrete

Che uscira da voi sopra un carro funebre
E nel ventre suo piu voi non potrete

Generare i vostri figli perche dentro di voi
Oramai non c'e piu amor
Non c'e piu amor !

Broke the gentle hearts

Crushed me mercilessly

And I don’t want to wind up like him
He can't afford that Tom Ford, you won’t like that man
Grinding that old food, no AC or fan
No trips to Jamaica, babe you gets no tan
I wanna pull up pull up in a 4-4 or Benz
A Sprinter van, with the TVs in
Your crew jump in, I’m getting those jeans
If we keep on, fuckin’ fly to Japan
You say that this shit mami, ‘cause you my girl
You say you just need me and need no one else
But I'm full of ambition to take over the world


She tried to tell me that the world is mine
And I know its true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose

Funny how it all go go, you never could know though
What happened to Tiger was Kobe, you know hoes
Get caught in a photo, lipstick on your polo
And all the trust that you builds right out the door door
Y’all went from lovebirds to looking like Dodos
And that shit gon’ last, for months it’ll go go
And that shit gon’ drag, drag on like Komodo
Over a bitch that look like Quasimodo, god!
Now you calling and checkin' in
All the time like your ass still on parole though
Wondering if you just better off solo
You paying a price, but is that what it owe though?
Praying up to god about shit that’s not even holy
You like “she tripping over bitches saying that they know me”
Then she put the pussy on me, swear that shit control me
That shit control me, man that shit control me


She tried to tell me that the world is mine
And I know its true
And even though I got it all

'Cause this world swallows souls
And when the blues unfold, it gets cold, solids burns holes
You're going mad, perhaps you always were
But when things was good, you just didn't care
This is called irony
When you most need to get up, you got no energy
Time and time shit'll happen, the dark shit's unwrapping
But no-one's listening, your mates are laughing
Your brethren's fucking and then you start hating
Your stomach starts churning and you mind starts turning
So smoke another draw
It won't matter no more, but the next day still feels sore
Rain taps on your window, always did though
But you didn't hear it when things were so-so
You're on your own now, your little zone
You were born alone and believe me, you'll die alone
Weed becomes a chore
You want the buzz back so you follow the others onto smack


Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive


Feels nice and still, good thing about brown is it always will
It's easy, no-one blames you
It's that world out there that's fucked you
You're no less of a person and if God exists, He still loves you
Just remember that, the more you sink
The further back from that brink
Maybe you have lifetime scars
And you think tattoos might be more fitting, but who's picking?
Searching for yourself, you find demons
Try and be a free man and grasp that talisman
'Cause you're the same as I am
We all need our fellow man, we all need our Samaritan
Maybe I'm better looking than you, though
Maybe I've got more dough, but am I happier? No
Get the love of a good girl
And your world will be much richer than my world
And your happiness will uncurl


Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive


""Stop dreaming"", people who say that are blaspheming
They're doing nine-to-five and moaning
And they don't want you succeeding when they've blown it
And your idols – who are they? They too dreamt about their day
Positive steps will see your goals
Whether it's dollars or control, feel the gold
I ain't helping you climb the ladder, I'm busy climbing mine
That's how it's been since the dawn of time
If you reach a cul-de-sac, the world turns it's back
This is your zone, it's like blackjack
He might get the ace or the top one
So organise your two's and three's into a run
And then you'll have fucked him, son
And for that you'll be the better one
One last thing before you go, though
When you feel better tomorrow, you'll be a hero
But never forget today, you could be back here, things can stray
But what if you see me in that window?
You won't help me, I know
That's cool, just keep walking where you go
Carry on through the estate
Stare at the geezers so they know you ain't lightweight
And go see your mates
And when they don't look happy, play 'em this tape


Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive


I hope you understand me
I ain't no preaching fucker and I ain't no do-goody-goody either
This is about when shit goes pear-shaped
And if you aren't, or never have been at rock bottom
Then good luck to you in the big wide world
But remember that one day, shit might just start crumbling
Your bird might fuck off or you might lose your job
It's when that happens that what I'm talking about
Will feel much more important to you
So if you ain't feeling it
Just be thankful that things are cool in your world

Well I got a song out there recently
Which means I'm likely to forget the words


Deep down in the depths of forgotten dreams
So far away so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
With the pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand


As I traced the foam with the pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind and I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand sighs
I called her my princess of the sand


She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze 
She moved her mouth but it made no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess in the sand


One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

Someday when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea and I'll follow that sandy track
I'll look around, and I'll hope to find
That strange young dream, 
I'll call her my princess in the sand


As I thought I got the words


You alright then


Yeah
Yes I do actually that's my that's my surrealist song
It's crazy I don't know it's sort of funny dream

Excuse me ma'am, I saw you walking
I turned around, I'm not a stalker
Where you going? Maybe I can help you
My tank is full, I'd be obliged to take you


'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy


You sure look good sitting in my right seat
Buckle up and I'll take you through the five speeds
Wind it up or I can slow it way down
In the woods or right up town


I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy


Big thirty-fives, whining on the asphalt
Grabbing mud and slinging up some red dirt
'Cause I'm a country boy
My mufflers loud, dual thrust tubes
Crank the music and the tone gets real good
Let me know when we're getting close
You can slide on out or we can head on down the road


'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you want to go
'Cause I'm a country boy


Bucket seats, soft as babies nude butt
Locking hubs to take you through a deep rut

Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down winding roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go

I just came down from Chippewa
Had a station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I'd lost a year before
I hadn't seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by
When your memory came flooding in and you closed that door


Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door
Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I was a freight train


Well every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lines
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil


Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door
Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I was a freight train


Well every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track


Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door
Wish I was a freight train baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started

This going out to all the females that be having
To beat them motherfuckers in they head to get them
Off of them, Haha


Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin' pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin' for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right


Play your cards right baby, haha, play your cards right
Play your cards right girl, take ya time
Take your time baby, be patient
Just be patient baby, don't rush
Don't you rush it girl


Uh huh, Luda
You ain't gotta do that baby
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you playin' your cards
You got a brother feelin' mellow like a Cuban cigar
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin' like a playa, stop chasin' the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin', no rushin', just takin' it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, baby girl
You made me hurry up and wait and I know patience is a virtue

Play your cards right baby, haha, play your cards right
Play your cards right girl, take ya time
Take your time baby, be patient
Just be patient baby, don't rush

Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And my hom—and my homies all singing to it
3OH... 3OH!3


I ain’t callin’ for a close-up
No clubs, no cars
Bitches with the nose jobs
No dubs, no stars
I’ma do it how I always have
Whiskey in a 40 bag
Pissin’ in the alleyway
Out back of where the party’s at
I’ma spend it on a new whip
New hat, new kicks
Bitches with the huge tits
New gat, new slips
I’ma do it how I always do
Sleep until the break of noon
Wakin’ up just to make it through
Another night of shakin’ you

Party ‘til I’m 50
Wake up on my parent’s lawn
Them cops still out to get me
And I ain’t sippin’ on a mixed drink
Pinkie out, lips pink
Talking to a rich skank
Filled up like a sperm bank
I’ma go where I always go
Drinks are on the house

While your sister’s on my mouth

Roll me through the rushes like Moses
Roll me through the rushes just like Moses


Roll me through the rushes
Guide me to the new woman who waits
Current, leave me on the banks by the cottage
Where we will dine with silver cups and golden plates




I’m well prepared for my last journey
You know I've worked all my life
To make this basket strong
But a woman alone
On a river
She can't stay in the water too long


I've been chilled, I've lost my will, I’ve lost my will
And I've stayed away from rivers, for much too long
I really must stay in this dirty, dirty city
Till I found out that my strength was gone


Roll me through the rushes like Moses
Roll me through the rushes just like Moses
Just like Moses


Make my journey, make it short and straight
Let me lose this hardness that I got now, Lord
Water, wash away all traces of hate
I will do what you say if you just show me how, river


Roll me through the rushes like Moses
Roll me through the rushes just like Moses
Roll me through the rushes like Moses
Roll me through the rushes just like Moses on the Nile

Layin' bricks or layin' pipe
I don't stand out in a crowd
Just look like one of the guys
Little do they know
When I'm alone in bed at night
I become the King of the Silver Screen

I stare at the ceiling there;
I know where I belong
I two step with Fred Astaire or
Fighting old King Kong
I can be any hero at all;
Zorro or Don Juan
I know I'm the King of the Silver Screen

I could've been Valentino if I was born in another time

I might be solving a case or swinging from a tree
Share a joke with Crosby and Hope
We're such good friends, you see
Even dazzle the Academy with my versatility
'Cause I'm the King of the Silver Screen

Hollywood movies keep flashin' across my mind
I could've been Errol Flynn
If I was born in another time

I could've been a star
I could've been a star
I could've played that part
But Hollywood movies keep flashin' before my eyes
I could've been Greta Garbo
If I was born in another time

I wake the very next day
Go on back to work
I'm just a face in a crowd
Another average jerk
And all the guys on the building site look at me flirt
Because I'm the Queen of the Silver

Yes, I'm the Queen of the Silver Screen
I admit it to all my fellow workers
I don't care any more. I'm tired of closets
I'm gonna eat my makeup for lunch today
Just stop hittin' me again. All right guys?
I'm going to Hollywood to be a starlet
I know I'm 240 pounds and play center
For the Detroit Lions
I don't care any more
I like makeup and dresses and Hollywood
I'll make somebody a great little wife

Can't lounge in the boozer all day, got manoeuvres to make
Gotta see a man about a dog, can't be late, I'm always late
Raining cats and fog but nice and dry in the Black Dog
Down it in one, my son
Can't sit here, gotta run, things need done
If they don't win this and the next one
They're getting relegated to the third division
At street level, real people, same repeated sequel
Rock and roll, four to the floor
Like last night, yesterday morning
And the night before, and the night before


Apparently there's a whole world out there somewhere

I just don't see it

Paris Celine hop up in that Saline
I chase dreams, white man but the face green
Same thing err' day, err' thing gleam
Fuck my reply, the bank do the statements
Had me with my savings, I was saving in my savings
Two or three bedroom shack I was raised in
The condos out in Jersey full of Jay West paintings
Talk to the boy how you talk to the Lord
Talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
Marc Jacob plates, Margiela rugs

Fuck the pearly gates, I'm hanging by the steps
'Cause my target is my goal and I'm aiming for the best
I'm good at what I do, but I'm coming for the best spot
On the road to greatness, success is the next stop

I toast with the Gods, tell these haters take they best shot
I'ma be that motherfucker 'til my breath stop

We toast for the night and drink for the day
The God shed a tear providing us rain
What a shame from the pain 'cause we used to being slaves
Made a change from the whips, shackles and the chains
But nowadays man seem a little strange
Trade his soul for the whips and the chains, what a change!
No, I couldn't tell you what the difference is
But I could tell you what the business is
I was getting dividends, probably spending Benjamins
Both kind of synonyms, in the same sentences
Tell me what a good Christian is
Better yet; when Christmas is
Waiting on my presence, I must be a gift from heaven

"Hot summer night, the working girls were on their way back home
It was getting late so I tagged along, couldn't let them walk alone
I followed them up some greasy steps to a rooftop in the sky
No walls around just a sea of stars, my throat was getting dry

Everyone could feel the heat that's why we all disrobed
Our clothes and inhibitions went off flying 'cross the globe
Dancing crazy getting loose and closer to the edge
I could feel my blood was up and it was pounding in my head

So there I was, just me and the girls
Under the moonlight on the top of the world

As things were dying down we retreated from the precipice
I lay beside the most beautiful girl in the universe
Her name was Venus in Heaven
She fed me rice and offered me wine
I accepted ambrosia and nectar
From an amber goddess
I collapsed between the thighs of Morpheus
Next thing I felt was a sharp pain of sunrise
My mouth was open and full of rice
As I managed to prize open one of my eyes
I saw Luigi the cockroach carry off his prize
And there lay Venus still sprawled out and naked for sure
But not quite what she was the night before
I made my excuses and left through the door
Stepped into space at the twentieth floor
And that's why I don't like heights no more

Sit back and learn, come now watch the birdie
Your styles are incomplete, same as Vinny Testaverde
Battling, whenever—hot damn!
Give me the microphone boy, one time, bam!


Keep it on the cooler cos here come the heat
Lyrically in space the jazz will pace the beat
As we proceed to elevate you we in 4/4
Run and tell your dad the Abstract's the bad
As we proceed to move your hind parts we know as ass
Poets got the gimmicks, but they lack the sassafras
To make the average hardrocker cock the Glock
And roam the city streets on the jury, they hot
I be ingredients, like sugar in candy
If your life is broke, girl I'll be the handy-dandy
That can mend you, my fee is a shower
For you, I scrub the back and I floss the butt crack
Make you shiny, spiffy in a jiff
Fucking with the Ab, you got the greatest of gifts
A-yo, my mic is sounding bugged, Bob Power, you there? 
Adjust the bass and treble make my shit sound clear




Move back yourself man, come watch me drop it
For sure me a go do it, for sure me a go rock it
Me not deal with no changaram, bangaram business
I got soul on the end, like Jehovah's got the witness
Musically, the three, poetically we be
The enchantment on the airwaves, kids just fade
Obey the MCs, cos the MCs say
We flipping on niggas like we Super Dave
But noticing my stature, y'all niggas know we gotcha
Moving to the rapture, listen how we catch ya
Moving with the grace, here we go, let's begin
Making people jump out their goddamn skin
Lyrically, we bite like we Rin Tin Tin
Peace to Grand Pu and his many many skins
Don't mark us for the 'L' cos you know we get the wins
It's the Ab, Shaheed, and the Dawg for the blend


And I wanna say peace to my man Bob P, my man Jerod  


And Skeff Anslem on the help out - and we out like shout



Nine-tre, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

I don't wanna say nine-tre

Cause my man Extra P said don't say the years

So, it's for eternity, know what I'm saying?

You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me


Oh when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
When you're on the outside baby
And you can't get in
I will show you
You're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you
Darling and I will bring you home
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine


You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me


Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low, I'll be there
By your side baby
Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low, I'll be there
By your side baby

Since the beginning
Man had a grind
So I figured out it's our time
Yeah, to have this mission on our mind
Trip, tell em' boys why you on on your grind


I,ll be on the grind
Been married for a little bit
My wifey on my mind, we walk together living it
 She's a gift God delivered it
And Jess would take Trip like visitors, well grind then
Got a high call I lover her in his name
Gotta die for her  Like The Risen King
Wish I was the perfect man, but I still be sinning man
That makes this picture incomplete, like it's missing frames
But natural ways are flawed, gotta go against the grain
Get that water of the word, drip it like it's pouring rain
 I be grinding for a lifetime, very long
We got that Superman love,  very strong


I'll be on the grind, I'll on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I'll be on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
Now you can catch me going in
Got my focus on 10 boy
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
Got His mission on my mind
Man you can keep the shine
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind


Since the beginning, man had a grind
So I figured out, it's our time
Yeah, to have his mission on our mind
'Crae tell 'em boys why you on your grind


Hustle hard and fold them dollars, he don't even notice
That he got that tissue paper, all he ever do is blow it
As a christian I'm omission, yeah I stay up on my grind
It's some stuff I ain't buying, cause this money's not mine
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
I ain't talking rentals when I say that budget on my mind
Ten percent I do repent, I spend more than that on kicks
Wanna give my Father honor, He provide all that I get
You got plenty credit bills yet and still you don't sweat it
You don't see that you in debt, you just think that's extra credit
People dying for some lettuce, while we buying every fetish
We could show them Jesus better, instead of spending like a deader
Tell 'em


I'll be on the grind, I'll on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I'll be on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind

Since the beginning, man had a grind
So I figured out, it's our time
Yeah, to have his mission on our mind
T-Dot go and tell 'em why you on your grind


Man we so passive, we skip it
Sh-shifting blame, no transmission
No ownership like we rentin'
We let it go, and we quit it
Can't admit it, we did it, Make my mistakes and forget it
We only act like we're men, Somebody get 'em an Emmy
""Did I do that?"", Making excuses for our actions
Man I keep it Ben Franklin, I ain't down with Andrew Jackson
Real men make mistakes, and they own up to 'em quickly
Real men take the heat, you can call it Dirk Nowitzki
And they do it cause He did it, motivated by the King
Moving every man by his hand, minus all the string
I'm living like He lived, yeah that's what I call a grind
And since he carried His, homeboy, I carry mine


I'll be on the grind, I'll on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I'll be on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind

He doesn't want your love
But he can't say goodbye
He's begging you to stay
But he can't tell you why
You finally made your move
Your hand is on the door
You know the rest is hard
You've been this far before


Don't look back now
He's going to see you crying
You'll turn around
It happens everytime
That look will always break you down
Don't look back now


You pick your suitcase up
You hear him call your name
You'd give your soul to him
If things could be the same
You stop and close your eyes
You grab some memories
You think of better days
But that's all history

She don't mind flirting and playing, at least that's what she say

Could it be something I'm missing? Or am I just part of the game?

It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something

Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls


She don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She don't have the luxury to let herself go

I was mesmerized when I first met you
I wouldn't let myself believe
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams
But you didn't know that secret part of me
Until we kissed and made it open up so easily

You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
I always have 
I always will
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
Always have

Everything you'll ever need
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me
You gotta know but more importantly
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy

On a good day, when I think about her
I only cry a couple hundred tears
On a good day, when I can't forget about her
I can dull the pain with just a couple beers
On a good day I can even fake a smile
When somebody says I'm going to be ok
But as you can plainly see
I'm not having on a good day


So set them up
Here's a hundred dollars keep them coming Joe 
When I've had enough
Call this number and my brother
Will pour me in his car and drive me home
On a good day, I become the kind of man that even I can barely tolerate
And as you can plainly see
I'm not having' on a good day


On a good day, I would never crash a party
Knowing she'd be there with someone else
And On a good day, I would have stopped before I started
To make a major fool of myself
On a good day, I'd been quick enough to duck
Before her new love punched me in the face
But as you can plainly see
I'm not having on a good day


Yeah I only see you Joe
