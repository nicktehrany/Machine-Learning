"
Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?


I want you by my lonesome, above this crowded space
It's easier to hold some, when no one's in the way
Well if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
To show you the main room 
I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space
Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days
I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye
Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm
Tell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine


Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?


As crazy as it may seem, it's not too hard to read
It's too many ifs and maybes, and not enough certainty
Well if no one's putting numbers on the board
I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you
But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind
Take a look at that moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes
We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline
Take a puff of that, get a sip of this wine
Yeah, feelin' good?


Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?


She had a bright smile, big white teeth, I mean
Whiter than her white T, remind me of wifey
Met her at the studio, sort of like a high buyer
She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
She had this Asian swagger ‘bout her, so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to
But I'ma have to put in work, baby girl then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long
She come and see me, but she don't stay long
And that's the problem, she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'mma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter
Ay, .Paak


Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

I'm your top prime cut of meat, I'm your choice
I wanna be elected
I'm your yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce
I wanna be elected
Kids want a savior, don't need a fake
I wanna be elected
We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make
I wanna be elected, elected, elected


Good evening Mr & Mrs America and all ships at sea
The candidate is taking the country by storm
I never lied to you, I've always been cool
I wanna be elected
I gotta get the vote, and I told you 'bout school
I wanna be elected, elected, elected
Hallelujah, I wanna be selected
Everyone in the United States of America


We're gonna win this one, take the country by storm
We're gonna be elected
You and me together, young and strong
We're gonna be elected, elected, elected
Respected, selected, call collected
I wanna be elected, elected


""And if I am elected
I promise the formation of a new party
A third party, the Wild Party!
I know we have problems
We got problems right here in Central City
We have problems on the North, South, East and West
New York City, Saint Louis, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago
Everybody has problems
And personally, I don't care.""

I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing


I've had romance a time or two
Infatuation, then I found you
I've had 'em steal my heart and run
And that ain't fun for anyone


I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing


I like the way you make me feel
And what I feel, feels like it's real
I never once said I love you
Until I felt the one that's true


I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing
Yeah, I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing


I could get used to you everyday
And those tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved word shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there


When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there


On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of his resurrection share
When His chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies

Mistress, mistress all night long
Keep on coming, hard and strong


Hot to the touch
Hot to the taste
Who's now on my plate?
I'm gonna yell out
She's gonna shout
She gonna push it all the way down
Gonna kick up her heels
Make you scream
Back on out, baby
Make you scream


Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll


Hold on tight, she plays a tease
Squeeze you around she aim to please
She's gonna kick her legs high in the air
She's gonna shake it down a hot, wet, wild affair


Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll




Look in my eyes, what do I see?
A hot blooded woman just a-waiting for me
Gonna kick up her heels

"What grew
What grew
And what grew and inside who
First so simple was the vow
Then the chorus sang about
Your shoulder
The mooring for me
Like water lost in the sea

The cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake

I'm a stem now
Pushing the drought aside
Opening up
Fanning my yellow eye
On the ferry
That's making the waves wave
Illumination
This is how my heart behaves

The cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake


The rain making me cry

Then the wind comes
Fanning my yellow eye

The waves wave the waves wave

This is how my heart behaves

A cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake
The cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake

And what grew

We are in line, we are the trend
Brushed and forgotten in the end
Across the years we've lost each other
Blinded by a softly souther


I touch your skin, I hold my breath
The time has come, our love is dead
I watch the train as it dissolves in heavy rain
On tracks out of the blind lane


From the heaven of together to the earth of alone
Change your world before it kills you
There's no doubt this is what it's all about


We are in line, we are the trend
Brushed and forgotten in the end
Across the years we've lost each other
Blinded by a softly souther


I'm losing sleep, you're on my mind
I'm losing days that I cannot find
There's nothing wrong with being wrong for each other
At some time or another


From the heaven of together to the earth of alone
Change your world before it kills you
There's no doubt this is what it's all about


We are in line, we are the trend
Brushed and forgotten in the end
Across the years we've lost each other
Blinded by a softly souther


When it's all said and it's all done
We give up before it even begun
When it's all cold, when it's all gone
We stand still even if we try to run
When it's all said and it's all done
We give up before it even begun
When it's all cold, when it's all gone
We stand still even when we try to run


We are in line we are the trend
Brushed and forgotten in the end
Across the years we've lost each other
Blinded by a softly souther

Remember the first day when I saw your face
Remember the first day when you smiled at me
You stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
Remember the first day when you called my house
Remember the first day when you took me out
We had butterflies although we tried to hide it
And we both had a beautiful night


The way we held each others hand
The way we talked the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one


I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause its obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul


Remember the first day, the first day we kissed
Remember the first day we had an argument
We apologized and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games
Remember the first day you fell in love with me
It felt so good for you to say those words
Cause I felt the same way too


The way we held each others hand
The way we talked the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one


I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause its obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul


I'm so happy so happy that you're in my life
And baby now that you're a part of me
You showed me
Showed me the true meaning of love
And i know he loves me


I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause its obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me

If I never see your loving face again
I'll go on loving you 'till the end
And if my broken-hearted love dont find a way to mend
I'll go on loving you 'till the end
The years and miles may separate you from me
The pain may lessen more as time goes by
But as for me your memories will never fade


And I'll go on loving you 'till the end
If we're ever free to love again I know
Straight to your waiting arms is where I'll go
And I'll stay forever and I'll prove to you again
I'll go on loving you 'till the end
And I'll go on loving you

Oooh
He made it so hard to trust someone 
He made it so hard to fall in love 


Not tryna mess up this relationship 
'Cause the last man did me that way
You gon' do the same things
I don't wanna be this way
But I'm hoping you can change the way that I feel 
You see, I trusted him with everything
Never held back anything
Thought we'd be together for the rest of our lives
So suddenly he took his love away
And made it hard to trust again, oh


I know I've been holding back, but he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past and put it all on you
I'm not tryna hold you back
Really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do


When I think of what he did to me
It makes it hard to fall in love
When I think about just what I need
It makes it hard to trust someone
Baby, I gotta let go
Don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind


Whatever's yours, you call it ours
Send flowers with love, you keep me showered
And so did my ex-man at first
You see what started out so simple
All flew out the window
There I go comparing you to him again
It keeps holding me down 
I wanna give love a chance 
Baby, you could be the one for me
Yes, the only one for me
And I don't wanna lose a good thing, no


I know I've been holding back, but he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past and put it all on you
I'm not tryna hold you back
Really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do


When I think of what he did to me
It makes it hard to fall in love
When I think about just what I need
It makes it hard to trust someone
Baby, I gotta let go
Don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind


One disappointment, one heartbreak
Too many mistakes in love I've made
I can't come with all this baggage
Thinking he's gon' have it
See, I know I'm being selfish, but I gotta let it go
Close that chapter, close that book
Faith and love is all it ever took
That's why I never gave up
And I never gave in
'Cause I know true love is waiting for me again


I know I've been holding back, but he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past And put it all on you
I'm not tryna hold you back
Really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do


When I think of what he did to me
It makes it hard to fall in love
When I think about just what I need
It makes it hard to trust someone
Baby, I gotta let go
Don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind


He made it so hard to trust someone 
He made it so hard to fall in love

I'd never wish any of this on anyone or anything
Aw come on, you gotta try and look at things like me
I never needed anything I got
I never keep anything I have, what do I have?
Mostly things that'll never last
Then I think back...


I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been


They wonder why I hide myself from everyone
From everything, man come on
You wouldn't last a day as me
Everyone loves me for my past, but they always hate me in the present
Why can't you just meet me somewhere in the middle?
It's in the hardest times we grow the most


I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been


Speeding up, to slow down
Side glances around this crowd all at me
There must be something I can't see, so tell me
Hold me up, help me out
As I circle around what makes me happy
There isn't one place that I can be without leaving
This is my life


I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family, cause they could never understand
They don't understand
They don't understand


I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am
I remember the coast of California
I remember trucks stops cross the land
Never kept too many idols cause we were busy being them
I remember waking up in Georgia. I remember quitting my last job
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I was, where I've been
Cause where I've been

These old boots still got a lot of ground
They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm going to settle down
I've got news for you


I still got a lot of leaving left to do


And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you


Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do


I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose


Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do


Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two


But I still got a lot of leaving left to do


I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose

Got you cranked up loud, getting pumped for the night
But when we pull in her drive gonna turn you down quiet
I'll have one arm around her, one on the wheel
Hey radio, let's make a deal


I'll do the driving, you get us going
Play us a summer song that she knows and
I'll find a spot, I'll pull it over
You slow it down and I'll pull her closer
I'll find the moon and you bring the backbeat
You set the mood, we'll dance in the front seat
Hey radio, while you're playing we'll be falling
I'll do the kissin', you do the talkin'


Let's make it a night that she'll never forget
Put nothing but thinking 'bout love in her head
With nothing but the glow of your light in the dark
Take us home with the one that we call ours

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas

Belle e sexy meglio di lei
Ma a me sembra che lei è un po'
Troppo giovane per te
Ti capisco e come no?!
Se però soffrire non vuoi
Ohhh fuggi via da lei... Diana

Fra la gente insieme con lei
Mentre c'è chi pensa già
Che di Diana il padre sei
Ed ogni volta dover dire
Che tua figlia lei non è
Ohhh fuggi via da lei....Diana

Divertente, cotta al dente e tu? e tu?

E tu che non ti accorgi che lei sta cuocendoti a fuoco lento
Anche se poi chi ama di più

Finchè un giorno ti risveglierai
Come un pugile un po' suonato
Dal travuoto che ti ha lasciato...
Fuggi via da lei....Diana

E sono certo che nei panni miei
Pur di stare vicino a lei
Te ne freghi degli anni tuoi
Perchè lei è ...lo sai....Diana

Che un bel giorno poi finirà
Come pugili un po' suonati
Quasi morti e innamorati...
Resta qui con noi...Diana

Sometimes I can't tell between the highs when I'm lost in the low
Everything is backwards when I'm staring at the people below
I'm standing outside like a renegade
When everybody's here in this masquerade
Their eyes cut through like a razor blade, oh
Sometimes I can't tell that they are better with the devil they know


Maybe I'm just strange
Strange
I'm out of mind most of the time
I just feel so strange

The harder I try, I don't recognize

Am I the only one alone?
I'm losing grip on everything I used to know

Heaven ain't hard to find
All you gotta do is look


Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smilin' through your frown
I'm askin' baby boo are you down
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation, Mr. I-get-around
My temptation got me drippin' wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you're makin'
Baby why you fakin'? Strip naked get to love makin'
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize 'til that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'
A straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'
Stop with the beeper, baby, listen
I know you're grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find


Hea-ven!!
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find


Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believin' in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby, you're movin' to fast
My conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug?
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub?
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alizé, come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
And I know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven ain't hard to find


Hea-ven!!
Heaven ain't hard to find
Hea-ven!!, it ain't hard to find


You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talkin' since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back
Lookin' mean, what's all that?
It's like the closer you get
Baby, the quicker I'm speakin'
I got a flight out to Cabo
Let's kick it this weekend
I'm sippin' Hennessy and Coke
Though addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh God, help me, identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion
Who would have thought?
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends, I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind, baby
Heaven ain't hard to find


Hea-ven!!, Hea-ven, it ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find nice glass of Alize
Hea-ven!!!, Hea-ven!!! Hea-ven, Heaven

I've been running 'round for a long time
Feels like I've only begun
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
Way easier said than done
If God is for me.. tell me what could be against
When I look around all I see is this  like..
Everyone's worried 'bout falling in love, I was in it till death
I'm in a hurry now, thinking 'bout lyrics and where does the beat slaps
So I've been running, what else is there to do?
I treat love like a crowd, I'm always pushing through


I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
I've been running 'round for a long time

Maybe all along it's been the wrong time

Only right that I gotta go grind
It's only right that I gotta go grind
I've been doing this for a long time


So excellence..
Difference between me and him is the effortless
Effort I've been putting in so I do, I go measure it
Exit this.. that I've plotting to exit this 
That I've been sitting in, so far from stopping
I should be mixing, instead I'm writing
Ignoring  on my explorer page
Yes, I've been sorta late..
Is it distorted faith?
 that my God has been fixing me something better than I could have imagined
If it was my time, I would have been average

So all of my problem, they feel like a joke


I've been running 'round for a long time
I just wanna stay up with a strong mind
I been feeling like I found a gold mine
Maybe all along it's been the wrong time
I've been running 'round for a long time

I've been doing this for a long time


So.. late nights, early mornings, cold showers
Struggle and the hustle gets my soul power
Close to my loved ones, never feeling alone
Tryna get some work done, gotta get in my zone
 started to go dry
Don't think I'm special, I'm just another guy
Tryna follow God, I don't always do it right and
Step into the light, cause the dark was the frightening

I can't stress all the things that I can not control
But when I get ahold of something as whole other things that don't matter I have to let go..
 today
 I can not escape
And it's okay really, I'ma do my part
Hoping that you feel me

Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?


Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded


These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive


Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me

Let knowledge drop
Why should I be forced to play dumb?
I know where I came from so I'm going to claim some
But rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
Suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
Stop think of the past the brothers that die for
Sucker to try for never to cry more
Tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
He's a fake not a friend
So he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
Yo he's a trick so he sold his soul for gold
Now I know the reason we must excel
Cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
Move on be strong with unity
Cause that's the only way to build communities
Lies are told but yo lives must move on
And never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop


Drop that 
Let knowledge drop


Yo I'm running so I refuse to stop
Get sweated by them sell out cops
And I wink cause I pin the opposition
I'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach
So listen up to the flavor I gave you now dropping it
We folks know ballers know no stopping it
Dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
I got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm
For the simple fact that I'm black and educated
Proud of who am I and you hated
So all I have tried for this many have die for this
You see it and you hear it and you loving it
Now you buying this always keep your head look to the mountain top
Aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop


Drop that 
Let knowledge drop


Suckers suffocate when I hype this because you can write this
You constantly bite this
Thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
Caught with the dope dose
Now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
Cause you building a boom force
Like what you hearing so your checking with the source
2Pac brother with the rhymes to rock on
Dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
Amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
Suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
I'm not conceited but defeated I won't be
As long as there's dope beats I'll never be lonely stop
And let me breathe a minute
Aiyyo Dizzy what's up put the base back in it


Let knowledge drop 


By any means neccessary it's kind of scary
Knowledge of the hands of adversaries
Makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
I was waiting for a present GOD gave me a goal
I refuse to be busting like a sucker for I'm fighting like a titan
And run you down like a truck
I'll take a chance I vote for rock can see
Not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
Knowledge appealed to me
Pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
The bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
And knowledge drops


Drop that

Con il suo alito
Sui vetri freddi finche

Shawty got the McLaren and I had the seven
Pulled up at the compound, clothes smellin' like gunpowder 
Salute all the real niggas and real bitches that got they own boss
I was snappin' before Fabo, my raps come with a halo
Went out with Jeezy, we spent pesos like J-bo
Took E’s to the Twenty Grande
He got a pistol on him and twenty grand

Everybody need to calm down
Stand right by your homie's side

Put this shit down, that shit still burnin', I can smell that moon rock
I got to tell you how that shit started




Trapping off the court, on the back porch 
Had that pack ordered, we was backed up 
That's that good shit, that’s that hood shit 
You a cute bitch, and your crew thick 
Got a chopper on me the size of pool stick 
With a Blue DaVinci, dog food bricks

When brawl wit'you we send them bottles through
We send the marters through, I'm on the Carter 2
Like Tyrese was on the Marta, too
They start calling too, startin' falling through
Got them chickens boy, like a barbecue  
Talk to lame niggas something we hardly do
I sip the PJ bottle I rock the AP on them.

Take me to the water, Lord
Walk with me along the shore
And just before You wash my sins away
I can hear You telling me You love me more
Deeper than the ocean floor
But was I worth the price You had to pay
I wanna believe


It's been a while since I heard you call me
I can feel these waves crashing on me
I know you told the water where to stop
Still it feels like I'm getting buried
All this weight is too much to carry
Lord knows, I'm tired
Yet You promised rest for the weary
Still I wonder if you can hear me
All these fears and shame get in the way
I want to feel your quiet in this storm
Want to find my true rest in Your arms
Draw me closer to You


Take me to the water, Lord
Walk with me along the shore
And just before You wash my sins away
I can hear You telling me You love me more
Deeper than the ocean floor
But was I worth the price You had to pay
I wanna believe


It feels like it's been a long time
Since I felt the heat from the sunshine
I keep lookin' out from my window
And all I see is rain
I'm running far away from the battles
Still I can't escape my own shadow
Lord knows, I try
Feels like I'm on the highway to nowhere
Things will get much worse if I go there
But the Spirit always reminds me
Never be afraid
You called my name, I'm sure that I heard it
Here I come, please give me the courage
Draw me closer to you



Take me to the water, Lord
Carry me along the shore
And just before you wash my sins away
I can hear you telling me you love me more
Now my heart is reassured
I think I know exactly what to say

A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or ball
""Come sit over here"" somebody will call
""A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all""
But how many times I stop and recall

Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lyin' in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
""Come by for a drink, we're havin' a game""
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of 'em mine
But often my eyes see a different shine

Ah, the apple trees
Sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie
Looking at the sky
'Til the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young

Too heavy to move ahead with
Resembling a faker, charming snake oil tankers

Reverse stuck in my mind

Satisfaction guaranteed to kill the pain

"Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who sang a sort of Indian Hideho
To the people passing by

The pinto spent his time a swichin' flies
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
On the people passing by

One day they went a walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not lookin'
Toot toot
They never came back

Across the alley from the Alamo
When the summer sun decides to settle low
A fly sings an indian Hideho
To the people passing by

Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough
To the people passing by

They thought that they would make some easy bucks
If they're washin' their frijoles in Duz and Lux
A pair of very conscientious clucks
On the people passing by

The they took this cheap vacation
Their shoes were polished bright
No they never heard the whistle
Toot toot
They're clear out of sight

Across the alley from the Alamo
When the starlight beams its tender tender glow
The beams go to sleep and there ain't no dough
For the people passing by

I was sinking deep in sin
Far from the peaceful shore
Very deeply stained within
Sinking to rise no more
But the Master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry
From the waters lifted me
Now safe am I


Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me!
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me!


All my heart to Him I give
Ever to Him I’ll cling
In His blessèd presence live
Ever His praises sing
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul’s best songs
Faithful, loving service too, to Him belongs

I'd paint the town and stumble in at dawn
But now there's no one listening for my footsteps
And it's winding down to one more night alone


I thought I had her wrapped around my finger
I didn't think this bridge would ever burn
I always thought she'd take me back
But she taught me the cold hard fact
When it comes to love, I've got a lot to learn


It never crossed my mind that she might leave me
She did her best to love me till the end
If she were here, I know I'd treat her better
But I won't ever get that chance again

How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss

Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon


I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you


We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save them we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
“You need to let go, you got no control""
No

I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

Some days I can’t hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all

Yea when tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all

"Death may come invisible or in a holy wall of fire
In the breath between the markers on some black I-80 mile
From the madness of the governments to the vengeance of the sea
Everything is eclipsed by the shape of destiny

So love me now
Hell is coming
Kiss my mouth
Hell is here

Little soldier, little insect, you know war it has no heart
It will kill you in the sunshine or happily in the dark
Where kindness is a card game or a bent-up cigarette
In the trenches, in the hard rain, with a bullet and a bet

He says, ""help me out""
Hell is coming
Could you do it now?
Hell is here

See the sterile soil
Poisoned sky
Yellow water
Final scraps of life
Bringing new tears

Wake, Baby, wake but leave that blanket around you there is no where as safe
I'm leaving this place but there is nothing I'm planning to take
Just you
Just you

But keep your head up 
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin


Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up


Keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter


Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up


Keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter


And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up

Brushing dust off my shoulders
Like fuck it im focused
Im fucking with bitches thats only fucking with soldiers
Now listen
I got a old school the color of Okra
The tires as wide as Oprah
Watching it when its approaching
Now listen
Peace up
A-Town down
You know I got that piece up so I won't play around
Got a extra round
Plus I got a clip on it
Pollute your block
I put all that shit on it

"Willow weep for me, willow weep for me
Then your branches bring along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me
Gone my loveless dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow, and weep for me
Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a breaking and making a moan
Mamba to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone
Weeping willow tree, weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend old willow and weep for me

Will you lay me down

Where every sin has been washed away

And I won't love if I can't stop

From your first breath 'til your heart stops

How we gonna undo all the pain?
Tell me, is it even worth it?
Looking for a straight line
Taking back the time we can't replace


All the crossed wires, just making us tired
Is it too late to bring us back to life?


When I close my eyes and try to sleep
I fall apart, I find it hard to breathe
You're the reason, the only reason
Even though my dizzy head is numb
I swear my heart is never giving up
You're the reason, the only reason


I feel you burning under my skin
I swear I see you shining
Brighter than the flame inside your eyes


Bitter words spoken, everything broken

I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruising, bumping Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinking the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down

It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'd turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But Becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearing fake shines, I'm rocking a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm


Nigga you hustle, but me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need; them trees, that hard, that powder
My niggas move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna


Where I'm from you learn to blend in or get touched
I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch

You get the same shit for ten bodies you get from one cuz

Chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playing

I can't get my wrists to bleed
Just don't know why
Suicide appeals to me

The Quiet Room
Is sterilized and white
It's like a tomb
With just a moth stained naked night

Plastic forks and spoon
No laces in my shoes
They all know what I tried to do
Outside the Quiet Room

This quiet place
It ain't so new to me
It's haunted atmosphere
Has heard so many scream
My home from home
My twilight zone
My strangest dream

My confidant
I have confessed my life
The Quiet Room
Knows more about me than my wife

They've got this place
Where they've been keeping me
Where I can't hurt myself
I just can't I just can't get these damn wrists to bleed

A mattress on the floor
No handles on the door
I really need nothing here
I'm alone

I can't shake this sinking feeling
I know you're not there and I'm barely breathing
Holding onto things I can't replace


I'm looking for a way to change my mind and walk away

I wish we'd take back all the things we said

Talking in circles and chasing our tails

Spend a little time with the Lord in the morning
Raise a little hell when the sun goes down
Fire and brimstone
Drink our shine homegrown
Caught between lost and found
Yeah we're angels in the am
Amen!
But heathens in the evenin'

Yeah we sing Amazing Grace
And then we rock this place

We're just some boys on the back porch
Making noise after church
Watching that race go round
Spend a little time with the Lord in the morning
Raise a little hell when the sun goes down
Fire and brimstone
Drink our shine homegrown
Caught between lost and found
Yeah we're angels in the am

Amen!

"And it came to pass in those leaden days
That a plain, poor man got sick of his yoke of condemned soil
And a foreign empire's hungry purse
Time to replace pitchfork with sword
And sound the anthem of sheer rebellion

Enough
Once too often
Enough is enough

We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have our rights
That our fathers used to have

But we tasted the grime and blood
We tasted the essence of ashes

A glowing spark
Rising up from blazing falmes
To lead the forlorn and and wroth
The epitome of hope and freedom
A daring venture
A frenetic attempt
When Amandus was slain
The Bagaudae still sang

Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

If I, if I have been unkind
I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire

I have tried in my way to be free

"Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways

Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the Senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free

Hey sis one kiss and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed
Milton's Paradise Lost
Could be found?

But in the eyes of the Dean his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's got to do
What a man's got to do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter, and me

They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered ""I love you -
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol awol awol""

And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses

Now, the paint is peeling
Now, and when the chips are dowin
Now, you kinda lose all feeling
Now, your head goes round and round
Round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
I'm throwing myself off this train

Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways
Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways
Hum drum days, he's got
Hum drum ways, oh boy

Hey, you know I'm really earning now
My ship came in with a cargo of dollars
My name's lit up on the prow
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in dollars
Rolling in dollars
Rolling in dollars

Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle
The masked struggle that I'm in, the same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further the way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit and I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club
Still I love


If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom


If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
They count me out cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings
But being they ain't seeing me as human
In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love


If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom


It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah

All the windows were dark
No one knew he was here
All the Who's were all dreaming
Sweet dreams without care


You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel


You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you, with a
Thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole


All I need is a reindeer!
So he took his dog Max, and he took some black thread
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head
Then the Grinch said, ""Giddyup!"" and the sleigh started down
To the homes where the Who's lay a-snooze in their town
""This is stop number one,"" the old Grinchy Claus hissed
As he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist
Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch
Then he slithered and slunked, with a smile most unpleasant
Around the whole room, and he took every present
Pop-guns! Pompo-nooze! And cookie! And drums! Checkerboards! Mistle-binks! Popcorn! And plums!
And he stuffed them in bags
Then the Grinch, very nimbly stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney


You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty, wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk

The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote: ""Stink. Stank. Stunk.""


You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch

You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss

Not even Puff and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm saying this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son, I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rapping niggas dying to shine
And I'm tired of fiends asking for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punchline from me may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down before I make change
Yo, the sale went stale, caught 'em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man indictment, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an O.Z
My man brought 'em to me, see he ain't really know, B
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just trying to prop to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him O.Z.'s then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-d's -- damn man, I O.D
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holding the heat
Po-po walking to beat, we burning L's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over, I can't believe it, damn it's over
Feds seized the Six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rolling in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
.380 six-shot Glock top loader
Keep it in my waist, son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga, so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a motherfucking marathon

Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be

Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shootin' craps in the alley 'til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies, but don't waste it all

Get out the street before they hit y'all

And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me

Make them suckers act right, yeah!

What I'm supposed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down

On the edge of my destruction marching on
Still suffer in darkness with the dreams of life not meant to be
As i lie awake and curse the rising sun

And this pain in my heart for no reason

Why don't they just leave me alone

They've got her all figured out and
There's nowhere to hide
Why can't they all see who I am?
When will they understand?


It may take some time
They don't know how it feels
Because they can't read my mind
They always say I'm too young and
They feel they should help me
But I can make it all alone out here on my own


Every day I feel so in demand and all
I wish I could find is a place I can land
One day I'll feel comfort inside because
I'll know who I am
I can hold the line if I know in the end
That I won't be left behind
I don't regret what I've done
I don't think you can blame me
Now I'm standing all alone out here on my own
I'm not thinking about leaving home
But I need to be on my own
Doesn't mean I have a heart of stone
I won't even ask them why
I can't ever let them see me cry
Here I'm standing all alone out here on my own
Out here on my own
Feeling lost in a world full of lies
I can't help thinking that love is just
Passing me by
Hold on to what I believe
And keep an open hand


Can I have it all if there's no one to turn to
When I stumble and fall
Is there a secret I need
Because no one has told me
All alone

My mama and my papa they are sleeping side by side
And their spirits now are roaming with the blessed

Letting in the sunshine and the rain
And the only friend I've got now is that good old dog of mine
And that little old log cabin in the lane

Oh the paths have all grown up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way

There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter


He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there he made his bed
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
“The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”


Oh, the leaves began to falling
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart
“If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”

You're crumbling under the weight of the game
Before you let it all just go to your head
Now you're praying that you're walking away


You know your world is in my hands
You know I pull the strings
I like to see how tall you stand
'Cause if I wanted I could take it away


Get laid out
Or I'm gonna lay you out
Stay down
Or I'm gonna keep you down
I want it to break, I want it to burn
I wanna bury you until it hurts
And I'll take, I don't ask
This breath will be your last
Do you feel the collapse?


I want it to break

Get laid out
Or I'm gonna lay you out
Stay down

Counting so much money  I got arthritis
So cold I frostbite 'em, no Pig Latin but I hog-tied 'em
If she gets this dizick then I 
With a nigga like me I’m killing this beat
Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet on my sheets
On top or from the back, I thundercat like 
My girl got a big purse with a purse in it
And her pussy so clean, I can go to church in it!
Oh Lord, O-M-G, I am the O-N-E
How ya like me now? It’s cool but she want mo' D

Me and yo girl networked, now she wanna know my net worth
Wood grain, chestnut, titty fuck, chest nut!
Move shit, UPS truck, pull a lil' out n out the rest up
Competition need to rest up 
I aim at ya head, put the vest up, matter fact put the vest up!
This shit I’m shootin is penetrating, you don’t want this situation
Tall nigga with a short temper

And now I got me a bad bitch
That got a bad bitch that got a bad bitch

My life is like a video game
I maintain when I'm in the zone
One player, one life on the mic limited time 
No fucking around I'm cutting down anyone in my path
Trying to fuck with my game with razor sharp lyrical throw stars
Here my flow's hot
Ho$$tyle
Wild, out of control
Ninja skop befokte rof taal
Rough rhymes, tough times
Met fokol kos, skraal
Till I hit triple seven at the ATM
Straight famine or feast
When you living on the razor edge
Stay sharp sharp
Rolling with the $0$
High energy
You never seen Zef so fresh
Uh! When we mic check Hi-Tek flows flex
Yo we optimistic, not fuckin' depressed
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
Totally unknown
You can't fuck with my new Zef flow
I'm hard to miss
""You can't do this, you can't do that""

Ninja is poes cool
But don't fuck with my game, boy
Or I'll poes you
Life is tough when I get stuck
And my time is up I push through
Till I break-break-break on through to the other side
Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker
Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain it's not sore
Don't ask for kak or you'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive
My blades swing free
Decapitate a hater
With amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage from the dark side danger!
Yin to the yang
Totally Hi-Tek, Ninja's motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a microphone, big dreams, and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja

Fuck this is like...
The coolest song I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn't make it
They said I was a loser
They said I was a no-one
They said I was a fucking psycho

Changed all my plans, look what you've done
My house is small, and there's only room for one
I know this game, darling, I don't want to play
Why can't I just walk away?
Who's got the time? I need my space
Maybe someday in another time and place
Just turn around, I don't need this, not right now
But I'm falling anyhow


 And it feels so fine
 'cause I feel something deep down inside
 I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know 
Nobody's got to tell me so
 Said that it feels so fine, yessir
 Feel something deep down inside
 I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know 
Nobody gotta tell me so


See, hearts never lie, the truth is in a sigh
I look in his eyes and I'm on fire
Logic prevail
I don't believe in fairytales
But now, lately I find, I'm waiting by the phone
And I don't want to be alone
Feelings won't fade
But I'm falling deeper every day


 It feels so fine
 I feel something deep down inside
 I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know 
Nobody gotta tell me so
 I said that it feels so fine, yessir
 Feel something deep down inside
 I see this light in his eyes
And I know what I know 
Nobody got to tell me



I know what I know

I give up, I give in
Touch your body, taste your skin
The answer is the same again and again




 I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know 
 I said that it feels so fine, yessir
 Feel something deep down inside
 I see the light in his eyes

Why it should be thus all the day long

Never molested though in the wrong

Leaving our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty gritty


Yes sir, no sir
Don't come close to my

Can’t catch no dose
Of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer

Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma she's a cooking
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto


Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It isn't no good when boss man's
Stuffing it down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rocking the street

: I don't know why I be fuckin witchu


Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit', tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get him a piece
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go


There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go


I should have never trusted you, from the jump
You disgust me so much, you make me look like Willy Lump
With your ready made plans, did you shake your man, yet?
Did you resell him, did you tell him how I make you wet?
I can't forget when we met conservative but freaky
Irresistible, critical, positive but sneaky
It's a shame we played games so many nights
You squeeze me tight but in my mind I knew it wasn't right
But out of sight, is out of mind is how I thought of you
I can't compare with no sentimental value
Your nig' would wig if he knew the things you done to me
His little sweetie scooped up so easily but never me
I was lost in the things you did
Hidin' my cigs, tellin' me how much you wanted my kids
But love don't love nobody feelings change
Guess you had to rearrange, and there you go


There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go


These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I ain't really tryin' to claim bitches
Niggas who don't hang come put your ""D"" on the same bitches
That be the main bitches who say they loyal
Promise to do some thangs before you, kill for you, but maintain your spoils, truly
Cutie, booty big, but that ain't movin' nothing in my crib
When I could see from the door she sure ain't shit
But you in love with her, want to go to the club with her
And when you stuck, she up like an ordinary thug nigga


See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O's preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast, see
I been trying to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump your aim, straight through them spandex
Don't front, just name
Spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H20, it ain't nothing for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a hoe
But there you go


There you go actin' like a ho
Again, there you go, there you go
There you go actin' like a ho

There you go actin' like a ho

"After nine years in the army
They took away his brain
They tattooed ""defect"" on his brow
And signed him up again

He killed ten thousand Germans
A hundred Japanese
A family of Hindus
And a lot of Portugese
Nine plan failed

I could never see the point
Of showing them you're boss
When they drag you through the city streets
And naiI you to a cross

They took him to the office
They strapped him to the bed
They fastened lots of pretty wires
Securely to his head
They wheeled him down the corridor
Upon a metal trolley
Now he wears big spectacles
And he sings like Buddy Holly
Nine plan failed

I could never see the point
Of showing them you're boss
When they drag you through the city streets
And nail you to a cross

The world declared its armistice
And took away his guns
And now he satisfies himself
On piss-weak tea and buns
On piss-weak tea and buns
Oh oh at the disco

Rome is very pretty
And Rome is very grand
But the Pope lost his four fingers
When they gave this boy his hand to kiss
When they gave this boy his hand to kiss
It wasn't funny no

He wasn't very good at school
His highest grade was C
But he believed the managers
When they said: ""you leave it all to me""
They gave him suits from Saville Row
The quality so fine
So now he sits in the desert wastes
Just waiting for the sign
Nine plan failed

Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And mama told me be a thug, since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, 'cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin', never heard my friends callin'
Couldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in
Shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
'Cause in my mind, I see sunshine
I thought I didn't have to run
Now I'm duckin' from the gun yellin' ""One time!""
Take your time to feel my record
And if you did, chill a second
My blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong

Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin' life as a thug, time to face the truth
What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God
Come and save me, had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin' crazy
I can't read the signs
I'm blind, but a nigga know he need his nine
'Cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
And my niggas on the streets, man, listen
'Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way, I'm bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay
It seems I can't find my focus and homie, I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, it's hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear

Last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail
Just as well, 'cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped
And mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, ""Baby, it's on!""
And now I'm hustlin' and bustin' them bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin' G's
Buyin' all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now

But baby, you feel pain
Mama was sane when I felt like running away

So he ain't gotta be around no more
Pussy so good, I pay the mortgage and all her rent
Pussy so good I might just tattoo her name on my dick
Pussy so good, I might just fuck around buy her a ring
No I'm tripping, that's what happens when you gone off a tab
Some LSD, some S-E-X
My tongue on the mouth, my hand on the breast
Don't try to kiss me after head, I'm a man of respect
It's like you got a gold mine in between those legs
You ever had a gold smile, nigga give you head
Lick, lick, lick
She said me next


Headed to the mental ward
When I say I'm gon' give it to her
Shorty cake just like a Cinnabon
Taste a piece, soak me up
Fuck her good, love or lust
Hit you later, see what's up
We could get it in


I see you geekin' from far away
I'll wait another day
'Cause all them secrets you revealing
Nowadays got me fiendin'
I see you geekin' from far away
I'll wait another day
Cause all them secrets you revealing
Nowadays got me fiendin'


Shawty fire, fuck around and let her live in my crib
I call her ex, tell him this is my bitch
Word to Kirk, yo it is what it is
Tat her name on my wrist
If I slice 'em, we both gonna die from this, uh
I'm suicidal when I'm not in your presence
You know you want it even more when it's not your possession
Time is of the essence
Give me some time
Make a little investment
Know you feel a little neglected


I need a bitch with elegance
A bitch with etiquette
A ride or die bitch
The one who I can get cheddar with
Is you down for whatever, would you hold a Beretta?
If it came down to some fed shit, would you tell em?
Look, time gon tell, but you might as well, uh
Heavenly sent, yeah, you fine as hell
Love the way she looking in that new Chanel
I might give her ten thousand to do her nails


Headed to the mental ward
When I say I'm gon' give it to her
Shorty cake just like a Cinnabon
Taste a piece, soak me up
Fuck her good, love or lust
Hit you later, see what's up

"On wings of burning fire across the oceans far
The legends of the seven seas and mystic fallen star
Their laden ships are sailing on towards the sun
To the island of the everlasting chosen one

Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
The crown and the shining light
Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
Prepare the eternal fight

Lost in a dream in a boundless sea
Rivers of pain are guiding me
Defending this land from the sins of man
Never surrender our dreams again

Ride forever onwards stare into the sun
Where hopes and dreams are everlasting marching on and on
Rise another day across the distant skies
Where the dawn above the winter moonlight shines upon the fall of our lives

Insanity sublime shall make by bleeding heart
Feel cold and fearless anger rising far beyond the dark
In search of might and wisdom sacrifice our souls
In the name of truth and justice never to be told

Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
The crown and the shining light
Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
Prepare the eternal fight
Can you not feel the eternal pain
Flows through your heart and every vein
The torture begins and it breaks you down
Nothing to save when the soul is gone

Ride forever onwards stare into the sun...

Tuxedo waiters, black tie
White table clothes and red wine
We've been planning, this night
Looking forward to it for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up
And you know I love showing you off
But watching your baby blue eyes
Dancing in the candle light glow
All I can think about, is getting you home


Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about is getting you home


I don't need this menu, no I don't
I already know just what I want
Did I hear you right, did you tell me
Go pay the waiter and lets leave
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes
And your hand drawing hearts on mine
That our night out of the house
Ain't gonna last too long
When all you can think about, is getting me home


Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about is getting you home

If I had you at my mercy there's no telling what I'd do
But I'd sit and make you listen for an hour, maybe two
And then you'd know I need you everyday that rolls around
And your feet would walk on velvet with gold all over the ground

All your trails would be downhill, a soft breeze at your back
A sky full of diamonds and your nights would not be black
Yes, you would really love it and if you're ever down
I'd give you rows of roses and gold all over the ground


I'd pick you up and carry you across every stream I see
And I'd bundle you in kindness until you'd cling to me
We'd sit beneath strong branches, my arms would twine around
I'd turn your green to emerald and give you gold all over the ground

I'd pick you up and carry you across every stream I see

I guess right now you've got the last laugh


I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here


Tell me they love it, they want me, they need me
Surrounded inside of this room by the gritty
It seems like these women is needy
But all they've been wantin' and needin' is money
She callin' me honey, I know that she lyin'
And all she want from me is everything high end
The ladder, the ladder, she love it, she climbin' above it
The higher she gets, she gets no vision from it
The second she plummet she gon' be right here
The second she plummet she gon' be right here
At the bottom with killers and dealers
Now they say that diamonds forever but never explain
That the diamonds fillin' up your safe cannot fill up the pain
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here


Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here


Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

"I thought about my scene today
And I’ve finally got the words to say
The truth is cutting like a knife
Gonna use it to cut away my strife
The grass is green and the sky is blue
My head is clear and my thoughts are true

Callin’ out young and old
We got a thing that can’t be sold
The time that takes to rise above
In the summer of love

I wake up each day to the sun
And it’s hard to chose what to do for fun
A blissful world surrounds me
And my brothers and sisters love is always free
Don’t you know that I’ve waited my whole life
Just to show what’s inside and let my love flow
That’s what I’m sayin’

Callin’ out young and old
We got a thing that can’t be sold

Now this is the 'Grey Goose'
Down in my home, people go to church on a Sunday
A Baptist church—and they had a preacher which was a pastor of that church
Instead of he going to church that Sunday, he went out and tried to kill a grey goose, and the goose is still laughin' at him


One Sunday mornin', Lord, Lord, Lord
Preacher went a-huntin', Lord, Lord, Lord
He carried 'long his shotgun, Lord, Lord, Lord
'Long come a grey goose, Lord, Lord, Lord
Gun went ""a-boo-loo!"" Lord, Lord, Lord
He was six weeks a-fallin', Lord, Lord, Lord
He was six weeks a-haulin', Lord, Lord, Lord
Then my wife an' your wife, Lord, Lord, Lord
Get a-feather-pickin', Lord, Lord, Lord
They was six weeks a-pickin', Lord, Lord, Lord
Put him on a parboil, Lord, Lord, Lord
He was six weeks a-boilin', Lord, Lord, Lord
And they put him on a table
And the fork wouldn't stick him
And the knife wouldn't cut him
Then they throwed him in the hog bin
And the hog couldn't eat him
And he broke the hog's teeth out
And they put him in the sawmill
And the saw couldn't cut him
And he broke the saw's teeth out
And the last time I seen him, Lord, Lord, Lord
Flying 'cross the ocean, Lord, Lord, Lord
With a long thing of goslings, Lord, Lord, Lord
And they all went ""quack quack,"" Lord, Lord, Lord

Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained
Military mind of a thug lord, sittin' in the cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, everybody's listenin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight


'Till Makaveli returns, it's ""All Eyez On Me""

And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be
You should've listened, I told you not to fuck with me

Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see



Now since you're crying for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nothin' left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not  - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
God made men the same boy, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playing with guns
While your momma had your punk-ass playing tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly-hearted, you couldn't make it on your own

Stranger ones have come by here

On a hill overlookin' the own
Where time's left a wreck where once was a beauty
And soon the old house will tumble down

When the leaves begin to fall in the autumn
And the raindrops drip from the trees
There's an old old man who walks in the garden
And his head is bowed in memory

They say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
And they planned to be married in the fall
But her love withered in the last days of summer

Ain't got no patience, so let's go 
Look, I'm diet drama
Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas
Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes



Walk in the place, they know my face
Encore, sophomore
Only one solo, I swore
Big mouth, applause
Oh please, one more
Wanna hear it before I say ""naw""
Let me check my itinerary, umm... alright
Presto, skintight
Escaped, and I risked my life
For what, so I could watch them bite?


Only one Gwen you can find like this
I mean blows your mind like this
Your key won't shine like this
If it's yours, then you know it won't wind like this

Look, I'm diet drama
Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas

I know you've been waiting, but I've been off making babies
And like a chef making donuts and pastries

Sex and sugar is the flavor, ovens and beaters and graters
Beats made of bongos and shakers



Walk in the place, they know my face
Billionaire boys, ice cream drippin' 'cross the floor
Big house, garage
Bentleys, Ferrar
Wanna go before I say ""naw""
Let me check my itinerary, umm... alright

Bed in the back so I have a G night
Good night

Ain't no nigga you can find like this
I mean, blow your mind like this

Now sweat, baby
Get stupid, jump up, go crazy
L.A.M.B. in 3D, worldwide across your TV
P, you crazy, how'd you get this?
This sounds like Disco Tetris
Do I have time to connect this?
Let me check my itinerary, umm...
I came back for my spotlight 
I disappeared like Houdini 
If yours didn't come out right 
Go to Kinko's and xerox me

Let's go!


In the beginning, I was upfront
Nothing to think about, you'd always hear me out
We made a pact and never gave up
When everything would change
We'd always stay the same
Something went wrong along the way
You come around and there's nothing left to say
It's like we're strangers anyway
What more could you ask of me


It's been a long time coming
But everyone's going to hear me out


If I leave bet you'll wish I stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now
If I leave this, if I leave this way


I've always been a man of action
Never let anything keep a hold of me
Could always tell when something's missing
Like I knew everything, except for you and me
I can't make you want to stay
God knows I tried, but this broke under our weight
I still gave it everything, I guess I'll never catch my break


It's been a long time coming
But everyone's going to hear me now


If I leave bet you'll wish I stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now
You know that time can't help us now
If I leave I shall move away
And try to right all the wrongs we've ever made
Won't let your problems weigh me down
If I leave this, if I leave this 


Never thought you'd be the last one standing
Never thought that we would come this far
You'll always be there looking over my shoulder
I've come to terms with exactly what we are

And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair

You ever said?
Time is not on our side
But I pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand


Before you leave, you must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you


Are you afraid?
How ever could you not be?
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Pointing at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me


Before you leave, you must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved


Will you sit
And talk the stars down from the sky?
Down there, forget the chaos in your eyes, love


And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave, I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave, see my children playing at your feet

Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires...




I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name


Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal


I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death


Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

The twins they are exhausted, seven is the night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die


One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night


Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

This shining city built of gold
A far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye 'round here
Look to the waters of the deep

A city of evil

There sat a seven-headed beast
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked

The beast and the harlot


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great


The city dressed in jewels and gold
Fine linen, myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once
As her mourners watch her burn

Destroyed in an hour

Merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss
With her sins piled to the sky

The beast and the harlot


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great


The day has come for all us sinners
If you're not a servant, you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city
Looking back on her to see there's nothing around

I don't believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to Hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great

"There is a place within you that is always at rest, always at peace
An aspect of your being that is always within your reach and yet somehow we all forget
When we're in that place of peace, we experience our innermost strength, smoother edges, and boundless depth
And when we come from that place in our inner and outer relations
Every choice we make resounds throughout all creation
To come from this place of peace, think of your life as an ongoing broadcast every day
There is a broadcast within you
Thoughts, words, judgments, feelings
This broadcast is ancestral
Often utterly unconscious, and sometimes deeply healing
Especially when we're attentive to our breathing
There is also the broadcast going out to the world around you
Not necessarily through your words or your point of view
But through your subtlest silent signals that are teaching others how to treat you
And both of these transmissions need our attention
Because when we forget to live from that place of peace for too many hours, days, even a moment
We begin to believe we can't hold ourselves up
We easily forget that we're far more than enough
So we're asking and listening
We are here to give up this futile resistance
We're here to remember that every heartache, every challenge, every rejection, and every loss that seem to have such an exorbitant cost
Are actually here to carry us across to the next opening

Blowin' whites back and forth, beef boy was on the block
Niggas watchin' bootleg flicks in the barber shop
Tony he was up in it, talkin 'bout dis and dat
Sayin niggas owe him money they gon' pay him or get clapped
Man when it come to the bread niggas know what im about
Nigga owe me 7 grams I'm tryna air his ass out
Call the connect four times this nigga ain't callin' back
All of sudden hes pumpin' now dat niggas ain't got crack
Banks in the projects fuckin wit' bitches that fuck bitches
Tryna get by her to give her sumthin' in her momma kitchen
This rap shit just came to me son its like I be havin visions
After being shot the fuck up I make better decisions
I sat-back taught my soldiers how to re-act
El took my trey pound and blew blacks heart out his back
The beef don't mean nuttin' to me son I'm always in drama
Shit I say in my rap is real I put that on my momma
Say a prayer before I sleep, Lord bless me wit sum cake
And if I die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul he take


If I can't eat man if I can't shine
Its just a matter of time
Before I back out runnin round wit my nine 
Cuz I GOTTA GET MINE

"Well I read in the papers and I see it on the televison
Everybody's scared about the World War Three
Here I am a single boy unemployment and everything
Somebody better stop and worry bout me
Well can't you just see me now chin up chest out
A-hup two three fout all day through
Everybody seems to be worried about a somethin' other
Who's gonna worry bout Private John Q rumbumbaduba

Sometimes I get dishearted and try hard not to think about it
Heaven knows it's hard to keep from lettin' it get me down
But I'll stand proud when everybody else will be
Runnin' helter-shelter for a shelter underground
Well can't you just see me now...

When I's a little boy I used to sit and dream of travelin'
To lotsa foreign countries on a sight seein' tours
The way it's lookin' now I can stop savin' money maybe
Go free sponsored by a Third World War

Catch the tide
Looking for a peace at the end
Of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself
Fever's high
I'm all at sea and so unwise
I'm so afraid I'll lose your love
As times goes by
But courage is a fire and a
Beacon so bright
The sunset built a memory
Our love sign
And all at sea we come alive
Will I wash away, turning like a
Stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call a setting sun, to throw
Me down a rope
And take me to a place called
Home
I close my eyes, I know you're
There, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a
World I design
The sunset fires a lonely flare
Into the sky
And all at sea we say good
Bye

Stone?

Me down a rope

Now we was once two brutha’s of the same kind
Quick to approach a ghetto cutie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roll
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a jheri curl never quite learn
Drinking 90 proof on the roof trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope games
I just got the phone call, heard you got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, No time for females
I’m losing touch with my homie he’s a changed man
He hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I say I’m living large, all you see is the struggle
When I say I’m still thugging, all you see is the trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and everybody miss ya
I know we grew apart, you probably don’t remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never did get with her
And I can see us after school, we’d BOMB
On the first playa hatas with the wrong set on
Now the whole things changed, ‘cause we don’t even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain’t even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same young brutha that
When it’s time for war go toe to toe we’ll watch a brutha’s back
I can’t even lie, 'cause I ain't laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, but go ahead
'Cause I ain’t mad at cha



I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha


We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn’t
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I’m gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' 'n' grindin' wasn’t nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind me back, to a place was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we seperated, you told me you’d wait
Don’t give nobody my lovin' while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I’ll return but I gotta fight the fate’s arrived
Don’t shed a tear, 'cause Mama I ain’t happy here
I’m through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' max, I’m knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', “Hell, I know one day I’ll be back”
But as soon as I touch down
I told my girl I’ll be there, so prepare, to get loved down
My homies wanna kick it, but I’m just laughin' at cha
Y'all play too many games, but I ain’t mad at cha


I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha


Father forgive us for livin' while all my homies stuck in prison
Barely breathin' believin' that the world is a prism
It's like a ghetto we can never leave
A broken rose givin' bloom through the cracks of the concrete
So many other things for us to see
Things to be, our history so full of tragedy and misery
To all my homies never made it home
The dead peers I shed tattooed tears for, when I'm alone
Picture us inside a ghetto heaven, a place to rest
Findin' peace through this land of stress
In my chest I feel pain come in sudden storms
Life full of rain in this game watch for lead thorns
Our unborn never got to grow, never got to see what's next
In this world full of countless threats
I beg God, to make a way for our ghetto kids to breathe
Show us sign, make us all believe
'Cause I ain't mad at cha


I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha

I'm back first and foremost; I'd like to thank Nas
For allowing me to have be on the Illmatic, and that Stillmatic Joint
Changed the game a whole lot, secondly I'd like to thank the Notorious B.I.G
Who put Brooklyn on the map, you the revolution of that era
And all the artists that came after the era we started
I'd like to Thank the East Coast, West, the North, Dirty dirty
This is my story, welcome me back


For all those I still speak to guess we still peoples'
Life's more peaceful when you low and you eating legal
Certain niggas never spoke now it's peace to see you
It's a different side 'cause it's the streets too, pleased to meet you
Just think I was a thief and kieful
Sold coke even dabbled in a bit of diesel
Skid bidded saw the light and I slid with it, left the life
But for the price I can live with it we all pawn
Know a few niggas that's coming home
Could see 'em now in that '86 summer zone
Hope they adapt, whatever led niggas to smoking cracks
Knew a few that went too far for me to coach 'em back
What a waste, this little blood niggas'll cut ya face
Catching a case'll make you fuck around and touch your safe
This all I know, intelligence is all I show
I'm from the roots and the truth is that I love the dough
Welcome me back, huh


You attract some of the baddest when you platinum status
That's why I stay with prophylactics after what happened to Magic
Six days of my creation had to relax on the Sabbath
Remember asking certain niggas to past me a package
I was blind moving ass backwards
But you can bet it was the grind that made the cash massive
Back on my feet, accapella used rap to no beats
On the run, dun, was the first one to clap at police
I ever saw, can never catch me in the presents of flaws
Push the Accord in '94, MAC-11 in the board
Who wanna bring it? Since Nas, niggas swore I was Queensbridge
That's surprising from the wise I was taught to be lenient
Move in silence, my moms claimed my music was violent
Had to school her, let her know that I'm a user of talents
Many faces, Gucci sneakers with the skinny laces
Fendi sweats and Begets all up in the bracelets
Welcome me home, huh

On different corners spittin', pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that

Keep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck 'bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck 'bout how you feel

The root of why most relationships is startin' breakups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See, ain't a damn thing change but the weather

All pages have got your name

Hurry Daddy there's and awful dreadful snake
I ran as fast as I could through the dark and dreary woods
But I reached our darling girl too late

Oh I began to cry I knew that soon she'd have to die
For the snake was warning me close by
I held her close to my face she said daddy kill that snake
It's getting dark tell mommy goodbye

I wish a nigga...


You niggas won't believe I got the shooters to your shot
You think you're built for bumpin' heads with me well nigga you're not
This'll be the last time I try to fucking warn you
Next time your ass out of line, bitch I'm on you
Nigga that security you got ain't getting paid
Enough to take some bullets or that 6 6 blade
You fucking hesitate you gonna need first aid
My blade'll turn a line man into a feather weight
Who me? I wanna warn you motherfuckers ain't seen nothing like me
Still looking for a juxs and my wrist so icy
I tell the homies these niggas is full, eat 'em
They coming out the awards wearing their good clothes, need 'em
Take it off, tell that sucker ""take it off""
They ain't come up how we came up, man they niggas so soft
Half man half dog man my niggas sense fear
Brought 'em here in a Lear to take your Audemere


Nigga round the clock non stop
Niggas is hungry on my block
I'm from south side nigga where the gangstas play
Make one false move and you're blown away
I make it so hot nigga my Glock
Seventeen clip filled up with nine shots
I'm from south side nigga where the gangstas play
Make one false move and get blown away


Don't get coffee with me pussy I told you before
It's outlaw, lawless I fuck you up regardless
Niggas say they be work in I wanna see what they saying
Put that work in without a mans, bring me that nigga, chain him
ATL BET we can AR in the park
Make the parking lot sound like an Iraq war
Feel the mood change when I step through the door
Go head make me fuck you up that's what we came here for
Gem star, carve you up nice
Have so much fun I wanna do it twice
That's my bitch on the pole
You tipping she's stripping
I'm known for tripping
I just slapped the clip in
599 Ferrari state dipping
Cash getting, brick flipping
Straight clip in, good ghetto living
Big better vision
Bigger plans for a bigger bed to get in

You understand how this goes down right?
You seen this movie before, this a rerun

Huh, did 12 million that time
Nah nah nah, we call it the massacre
We did 10 million that time

Daddy sits on a front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone


Been a long time gone

Long time gone

Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together

Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone

Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar

Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’

Back to the wall
Don't close your eyes
And wait for your fall

If you believe that you know in this time
You've got anything to win
If you believe that you know

Bridge:
In this time there's nothing to get for you
You cannot really do what you want
You're a child, a prisoner in your mind
You are a victim of this hopeless time

You better believe all you do has a sense
It's not for nothing
You better believe all the troubles you have
Will play you someday

Why don't you help yourself and do the best
Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
Why don't you stand up to say who you are
To show the people that paradise is not far

Oh, can't you see we got the right
To look into the future without no need to hide
No, we won't accept what you do
We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
Oh, can't you see we got the right
To say we are here to see the light
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can



We are credulous idiots
And won't understand what they plan
We march with the times
It's what they expect and we do

Why don't you open your eyes
To undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
Go oppose with your fist
Fight for your rights

Oh, can't you see we got the right
To say we are here to see the light

Every now and then a rumble of thunder rolls across the sky
But the way you're crawling into my seat

Illuminated by the panel on my dash, it's got you back-lit

So vindictive, you'll say anything you like
The smile you fake, the steps you take

"Q-Tip:
In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed her mind, her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go...
On with the program
Creedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted
The brother who she acquainted
Was the enemy, scary ain't it?
The Pubic Enemy

Q-Tip:
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
With lots of love and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
Cause I seen the king with my very own eye
Schemed the scheme like a crack fiend fiend
And poppin up on the teenage scene
And proppin and pimpin hunnies with moneys
Whole situation to Tip, was kinda funny
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's tricks
The thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin
Threw a pot and his dome was beamin
You could hear him yellin in the motherland
""Baby, baby please. Baby, understand.""
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...
Of the enemy: the Pubic Enemy

Q-Tip:
Everybody get sweaten, a deep is still a threaten
About the AIDS, that hate the aids, but still will be forgettin
About the ??? like the rocky picture horror
Don't move tracks, cause the pubic had the hour
You can get it from sleepin' in nasty dirty sheets and
Wearin' nasty clothes for oh about a weekend
I suggest you do yourself a big favor
The press I keep questin, I'll be damned if I save ya
Please remember this: a kiss is just a kiss
A hug is just a hug, but a bug ain't just a bug
If you get the bug, oh boy, you'll be buggin'
You'll regrets your moments even when you started lovin'
....... Damn! After loving, just take it out

Respect yourself, then correct yourself
Make sure you don't get hand by the man

From an only child for the first fourteen years of life
All the pictures they were never seen and never heard from
I'm standing with Eric and Mom outside of Taj Mahal
Convinced that I am gonna be a writer and a movie star
I've a picture of dad here sitting, hair down to the ground
Bright all the eyes of the family now dead and gone
We've played games of fate and chance
We were caught and made to dance
Sold our souls to slavery
Lost our way and prayed for death
I took the pictures and the camera, dropped them in the sand
I wore a Micky Mouse hat on that day, Disneyland
I was crying at the camera, lying about my life

With commercials in between

And the Russians won't be so late
Uncle Sam don't wanna wait

You never ever had a right

And look up to the eternal skies
See warfare even there
What once has been a paradise
Now destruction and despair

In other worlds the children die
Lacking food ill from a fly
Oppressed by troops to tame their land
It's all the same again

Then tormentors steal his birth
They slam gun butts in his face
And leave his woman choked in mace

So stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise you voice pass on the light
Unite! it's not too late

How many tears flow away
To become a sea of fears
How many hearts are torn apart
Till another torment starts

But before the world
Turns into a sun
All cruelty and violence
On earth will be dead and gone

So stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise you voice pass on the light

How many hearts are torn apart

Oggi è un giorno in bianco e nero, pioverà
Cerco malinconico nel tempo
Qualche sogno che ho già fatto fatto, anni fa
Il gelo ha disegnato sopra i vetri fiori blu
E c'è una nuvoletta che discende di lassù
Si apre in due metà qui di fronte a me...

Quanti belli colori in quella nuvola
E quanta gente allegra
Sopra a un leone c'è
Un bimbo che invita anche me
A cavalcare tutti gli animali
Che san parlare come noi
E ridendo han ragione di pensare
Che le bestie siamo noi

Là nei prati azzurri galoppando
Sui cavalli bianchi e neri, giocherò
Sulle grandi ali colorate
Di bellissime farfalle, volerò
Seguendo le formiche in fila indiana marcerò
Poi ruberò il violino alla cicala e suonerò
E chi mi ascolterà canterà con me...

Quanti belli colori in quella nuvola
E quanta gente allegra
Sopra a un leone c'è

She didn't ask me where I've been
Her bags were packed and sitting by the door
She looked at me and said goodbye
I did my best to change her mind

She's steady as she goes
Now she's not crying
If i said it didn't hurt
I'd be lying
Where she got the strength to leave
Heaven only knows
But she's rock steady as she goes

It tears me up to watch her go
But deep inside my heart i know
Leaving is the only choice she has

She's had enough and she ain't looking back

I am just an aging drummer boy
And in the wars I used to play
And I've called a tune
To many a torture session
Now they say I am a war criminal
And I'm fading away
Father, please hear my confession


I have legalized robbery
Called it belief
I have a-run with the money
And hid like a thief
Re-written history
With my armies and my crooks
Invented memories
I did burn all the books

And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song

The man's too big
The man's too strong



Well I've tried to be meek
I have tried to be mild
But I spat like a woman
And I sulked like a child
I have lived behind walls
That have made me alone
Striven for peace
Which I never have known

And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song

The man's too big
The man's too strong



Well, the sun rose on the courtyard
And they all did hear him say:
""You always was a Judas
But I got you anyway
You may have got your silver
But I swear upon my life
Your sister gave me diamonds
And I gave them to your wife""
Oh, father please help me
For I have done wrong

Said forever nice go

You don't have to say things at all
You don't have to paint me a picture

Summer nights and winter days
Mountain sunrise, ocean sunset
Hand in hand in the haze

And there's clouds on my sunrise

Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...


What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway


When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen

Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
If dreams was reality
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
The only way that you can escape poverty
Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you hear this part
I suggest you go back and press rewind
I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
If they wanna see reality 
I'm losing you again ain't I?
Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they don't wanna see that
It's evident...pain is pain
We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean die with it, since we're already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...


When the dreams was reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty
American dream or Scarface fantasy
Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back home
Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash
End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
Now another mother screams picking out his casket
Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not
It's trigonometry  divided by some real life
And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice
The streets mowed him, can't make past that
It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at 
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
World trade happened on the world stage
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...

They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke
Welcome to the hood, yeah where niggas dyin' at
Same place where the best chicken gettin' fried at
Same place where the police killin', tellin' lies at
It ain't just the babies, man, I swear their mamas cryin' now


Another nigga made the news, it ain't nothin' new
He done dropped outta school, it ain't nothin' new
He done got his first tool, it ain't nothin' new
Mama on that dog food, it ain't nothin' new
He smokin' weed and he changin', it ain't nothin' new
All his friends gang bangin', it ain't nothin' new
Got a pocket full of hundreds and they all blue
Another nigga from the hood tryna ball too

Should we try to remember what is wrong and what is right?


No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years

And if we do forget them
And the sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and sadness
Come to visit us again?


Shall we dance a dance in sunlight?

Inside it must remain
No victory and no vanquished
Only horror, only pain

Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
Why cry, when he do you that way


I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it
Little ecstacy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastards drop
Label me Makaveli, thug nigga with pipe
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!


Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature

Why cry, when he do you that way


Haha.. started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin' for creamin' bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart.. and a real live nigga nature


Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's nature

Why cry, when he do you that way

Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's nature

Why cry, when he do you that way

Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
Why cry, when he do you that way
Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
Why cry, when he do you that way

Oh, I miss the comfort
Of this house
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are

The floor under our feet
Whispers out
""Come on in, come on in
Where it all begins.""


Can you chase
The fire away?

We climbed up to the top
In worn-out shoes
But she ran down, she ran down
She ran down to the house

A fox that gains our trust
But then breaks it as he walks
Away from us
Away from us


Can you chase

I know it’s time for me to go
When the sun is sitting low
In the sky tonight
The stars are putting on a show
We’re the audience they chose
To hold the light


I’m feeling somethin' so incredible
Some sort of chemical is spreading thick around my brain
I’ve got the sun and I won’t let it go
It burns a fire in my veins


Let’s get out tonight
You’ve got the fire, I’ve got the fight 
In my young blood
Let’s light up the dark
You’ve got the fuel, I’ve got the spark 
In my young blood


The RPMs are in the red
Driving closer to the edge
Up on Flagstaff road
I still remember what you said
“Are you living? Are you dead?”
You better let me know


Put on display just like a cinema
Standing naked on the stage and I’m unashamed
It’s so easy to be cynical
Let’s turn around and start again


Let’s get out tonight
You’ve got the fire, I’ve got the fight 
In my young blood

They say ""Love is more precious than gold""
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire


I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire


When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury


'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share

When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

In a high rise penthouse suite over the beach
Got a bad bitch, butt ass, massaging my feet
Bumping DeBarge through the iPod, I'm nodding to sleep
My homey Miz caught a charge, his bid start in a week
Valet garage, got eleven cars parked in the street
One of the few so elite, it's an honor to meet
Obama physique, groomed well, garments is sleek
Have a chick so in check you got to con her to speak
Don of the week, centerfold magazine style
Fuck Kenneth Cole, everything is Japanese now
Love dinner rolls, lemonade with iced tea mixed
Who's on beginner mode? I see through the sheisty shit
Politely flipped, handsome, slightly mixed
Random broads come aboard, few might see dick
Fights we fixed, it's a handful whose life's legit
Said it before, mahphukkaz, yeah life's a bitch


This is for the homeys that did it and got away with it
Still around and talking, lounging, never lost it
Built they own fortress, living the life
Four wheeling or they peeling on bikes

Kickstand the Kawasaki, cooling it off
Switch hands, the sour got me, I'm cool as the frost
Shower properly, smelling like a jewel in my north
It's only right like a midnight 2-2 Porsche
Dual exhaust, buck-60, fleeing, burning the clutch
Ballers is never talkers, they just learn and adjust
The jeans is crushed, double stitched, creased in the front
So go figure, ne-er nigga could teach me to stunt
Reach for the blunt, the reaper ain't release in a month
No sleeping, if you're scheming you'll get beat to the punch
Retreat to the Trump, feet up, fruit in the bowl
How many ever minked up and drop the coupe in the cold?
The view is controlled, the watchers just work and contribute
Only certified fly guys flirt with the visual
Circle the menu, main course pick of the day
Get yours, what else for a nigga to say?

We could say it's just how it is
And how it always will be
And believe things will never change
As far as we can see
It's a disaster and it doesn't matter
Well I disagree
A ray of hope remains if we take the reins we'll arrive eventually

Keep all the lights on in the streets of Babylon
Then we’ll just dig for some more
Pull back the curtain 'cuz one thing's for certain
Action speaks louder than war


Look around there's no time left to stall
 stand up while you can don't miss the call


Hold on here we go
Where we stop nobody knows
Breath and count to five
Live while you're still alive
Right before your eyes
Your best laid plan up and dies
Cleverly disguised
The bounty materialized

Now we’re moving fast
We’re picking up on speed
We got the energy
Creating fast
As we tunnel deep
And no time to think
Here we just react
To the things
We need
Hold on to your world




To live just in your mind
Is some kind of crime
Stuck in your station
In isolation
Never too late for beginning
To set your captive free

Tonight the moment has arrived
To live while we’re still alive


 look around  there’s no time left to stall
 stand up while you can don't miss the call
 end the debate don’t hesitate this time
 take a stance don’t miss your chance
To stand up right now!

I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he would’ve stayed home
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with every breath
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death


I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain
Whose heaven is like Ironsides
Whose tears are like rain
Who eats but is not satisfied
Who hears but does not see
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me


I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass

I know you know
Just how it goes when it goes
And how it feels
To be lost and left alone on your own
And what it's like
To give all you got and have to stand and watch it
As it walks away
So everyone deserves a chance to live and learn
From mistakes
That we make and hearts that break and bridges burn
Starting now
From this moment on nothing's going to go wrong
Love is here to stay


You'll never be without
You'll always have enough
When you're in my arms
You'll never go unloved
As long as there is time
And for all of it to come
No matter where you go
I want you to know
You'll never be unloved


So in this life we lead
Some things are guaranteed
You can
Count on the fact that hearts won't act responsibly
Now and then
Comes a love that's heaven sent and meant to be
So baby look at me

You still gotta try

Then step up on my back and climb
'Cause I never mind

And all the anchors that they hid inside your chest
We will unravel all of the chains
And toss the remnants all down the drain
And oh my hands are much too small to hold you up
I will be there to pick up the pieces
And keep you housed while you mend them up


And if you wind up in the dark again

On corners prophesy

So have no gods before me

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See, on the portals, He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me


Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, ""O sinner, come home!""


O for the wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

Okay


Why am I waking up out of my sleep
Thinking of ya babe
You had a hold on me
Now I'm feeling freer than I ever been
You been around love but you never been in


Um, ay, running out of shit that I can say
Wishing you the best and so I pray


I’ve been waiting for the day
You knew it was coming either way
I know that you hate it
But I’m freer than I’ve ever been
Something that you’ve never been


You had just what you needed to be
Everything you want to be
But you'd rather run round these streets
Now you're feeling freer than you've ever been
But really you feel trapped, no need to pretend


Um, ay, running out of shit that I can say

You don’t wanna touch nobody but me
Nobody
Nobody
You wanna be


Saved, I’m hoping that you found a way
I’m moving around state to state
I’m living I know you can’t relate
Now I’m feeling freer than I’ve ever been
You know I was down
Now I’m on the fence
Ah, ay, a lot of bitches wanna ride the wave
Most of them was out to take your place
You done went and gave that shit away

You knew it was coming either way
I know that you hate it
But I’m freer than I’ve ever been
Something that you never been

Una historia basada en la vida real
Basada en la vida real


Mira bien, quien está, tocando tu puerta
Igual que ayer, pero ya no lo puedes ver
Mira bien, sigue ahí, hablando contigo
Mientras duermes, y ya no lo puedes escuchar
Mira bien, siempre está, tocando tu puerta
Igual que ayer, pero ya no lo sientes más
Mira bien, sigue ahí, hablando contigo
Mientras duermes, y su voz la puedes escuchar
Te he mentido, he pecado igual que tú
He brindado mi sonrisa, he sido ser de luz
Destino de obscuridad, en mi interior
Me he dejado llevar también, de la pasión


Y se murió el amor, tengo una mala historia como tú
Y también cargue mi cruz
He visto morir una flor, de único color
Que no creo ver jamás


Y si el cielo se nubla y ya no te veo
El perfume de tu ropa interior queda conmigo
Y si el tiempo se aprisa y yo me pongo viejo
Tu foto quedará bajo mi almohada
Y no sé si llegará alguien que te suplante
Aún después de morir
Y si mí alma vuela alto, más allá
Sólo pido a Dios seguir cuidando de ti


Y se murió el amor, tengo una mala historia como tú
Y también cargue mi cruz
He visto morir una flor, de único color

Armour let it through
Borne the arboretic truth you kept posing
Sat down in the suit
Fixed on up, it wasn’t you by finished closing
Ramble in the roots
Had the marvel, moved the proof be kneeled fine’s glowing
Storing up the clues
It had its sullen blue bruised through by showing
Settle past a patience
Where wishes and your will are spilling pictures
Water’s running through
In the valley where we grew to write this this scripture


Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break
Not for a part in any gamut of the dark


Doubled in the toes
Annex it, it minute closed in the morning
Did not lose it in the stack’s stow
I'mma lay that call back on ya
You know it won’t beseech you
We’re laying in an open field
I will let you grow
No need to know this
So carry on, my dear
What is clear up in the daylight is we’re hung here
Fall is coming soon
A new year for the moon and the Hmong here


Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break
All that it seems
Bellows tracing through the streams
Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break

With an F-150 and a 30-06


Or have a bubba in the family tree

Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around
So be prepared - don't run - stand your ground


They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders... Pillaging!
Invaders... Looting!


Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone


They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the killThere's no turning back
Invaders... Fighting!
Invaders... Marauding!


Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle-weary​ fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen


You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
Invaders... Raping!
Invaders... Plundering!

And no one will get hurt
‘Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two


A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André
Beef is on my entree, gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, business on a Monday
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway
Come be my fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days
Finally got it today, swear to god my mood changed
Top off like toupees, drop off, touche
Yeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga, G
Riding on my enemies, this my ghetto symphony

Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive forget it, war ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
Till my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in its purest form
Don't complain I came to reign from here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports


Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer

I used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills

I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live

Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my old home
For dad and mother were called to heaven

Rich boy, hustler, slimmer Rick Ross
So don't get it crisscrossed
I'm a bit pissed off but the wrist still frost
Neck all chipped up, kicks still cost
I leave foreign change, I done catered out the Range
Me and you the same, homie, get it out your brain
South beach with it, I done did it out in Spain
Was never heavy with the fame
But the name still bang 'cause I'm heavy in the game


Yessir I'm heavy in the game 
I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not then you're only in the way 
'Cause this time  I'm heavy in the game 
Yessir I'm heavy in the game 
I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not  then you're only in the way 
'Cause this time  I'm heavy in the game 




Different breed, different needs
 in Nova 'cotia, mixin' weed
Influence to Costa Nostra, this is me
B-K A-Z H and I see 
And I ain't here to hurt nobody
I'm just here to watch chicks work their body, and
Back somethin' like Laila Ali, and
Head back to the hotel lobby, and
Louis V, jewellery
Who else could it be homie, who but me
Fresh Prince of the projects, Kool Moe Dee
With my Tom Ford shades and 'em up North ways 
I'm just tryin' behave
Tryin' get it how I get it 'til I'm finally paid 
Yes I'm finally made
Joe Pesci in Casino I can honestly say


Yessir I'm heavy in the game 
I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not then you're only in the way 
'Cause this time  I'm heavy in the game 
Yessir I'm heavy in the game 
I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not  then you're only in the way 
'Cause this time  I'm heavy in the game 



So at this point, in the uh-major is insignificant
It's all about the Cons' and the way that I be rippin' shit
'Cause I moved on from the fools I did business with
There ain't no hard feelin's like I just became impotent
Now they take to him, like valleys in California
Come what you want, fire, that's when the hoes is on you
I'll still be on the corner and I feel no shame
'Cause I bet you they goin' kick it like when your field goal range
So if you don't know the name of the killer you see
Let me spell it out for you like a kid at a bee
See I gotta get mine, no matter the consequences
That's why they feel the kid like one of the five senses
So why raise the question about my demographic
When everybody knows that my demo was a classic
I'm in the driver's seat like chauffeur in traffic
So you don't want to try with the Cons' you bastards


Yessir I'm heavy in the game 
I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not then you're only in the way 
'Cause this time  I'm heavy in the game 
Yessir I'm heavy in the game 
I gets mine and you better do the same 
If not  then you're only in the way 
'Cause this time  I'm heavy in the game

Time was on my side yesterday
So much can change between then and now
Where does time go?

Where do dreams die along the way?
Dreams are all we had yesterday
Who told all the vampires of the world
They were welcome anyway?
Where do dreams die?

Who gave who the message?
Who gave who the hands of time?
Who gave who the job to take reason and the rhyme?
Like another Holden Caulfield
I'm a Catcher in the Rye
Who told who to take the dreams out back to die?

Once I had a little dog
I called him Cracker Jack
He had a spot around one eye
That looked just like a patch
His legs were way too long
And he was awkward as could be
He wasn't much to look at
But he looked alright to me

I found him by the river bank
Just wandering about
He was cold and hungry
And his ribs were sticking out
I snapped my fingers, whistled
When he came, I picked him up
I was just a kid
And Cracker Jack was just a pup

I took him home and fed him
'Til he couldn't eat no more
I took him to my room
And put a blanket on the floor
After that beside my bed
Is where he'd always sleep
Each night in my prayers
I'd pray the lord his soul to keep


Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate, a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
Everything a kid could want
I had in Cracker Jack


Cracker Jack would run to meet me
After school each day
He'd jump and wag his tail
And look at me as if to say
""I love you and I've missed you
And I'm glad you're home again""
I knew just how he felt
'Cause me and Cracker Jack was friends

Through the woods and fields
We would often roam about
And when we got in trouble
We would help each other out
I could run almost as fast as Cracker Jack could run
We had a lot in common
And we had a lot of fun

He was always with me
When I was growing up
We shared each other's good times
And we shared each other's love
He only lives in memories now
But often I think back
To the days of childhood
The days of Cracker Jack

Everytime I read your letters it makes me smile, think, laugh, and marvel at how easy it is 4 us 2 relate to one another  It is my wish that when this letter reaches you it finds you and your family in safety and serenity. Now, where do I start? I'm sitting here with a fat stack of letters and through them all I immediately recognize your handwriting and know that you finally written me back and as usual it was worth the wait. This letter is hard to write because I'm editing as I write. I'm preoccupied with having any of my statements misjudged as ""hustling""! :) First of all, let me answer your questions. #1. No, I don't mind long letters in fact I wish yours were longer and yes I would love to not only hear of your adventures but also share some of my own. Yes, I will write a book. Right now I'm writing 3 screenplays so upon my release I can recoup from my losses. Instead of complaining about bad movie roles or negative stereotypes I'm writing my own visions. As far as the book is concerned, I am working on doing an Autobiography but if it is at all possible I want us to do a book together. That would truly be the ""BOMB""! Let me just tell you ever since I've read your book it has been going from person to person like a bible. Everybody from male inmates to female inmates have been reading it. I get a sense of pride at being the person to turn them on to your literary talents. Plus, I use your book with the women in my life. I have asked two females to read it and we use each chapter as a door to our own lives. Like the chapter on Nikki is my favorite. I was trying over the past few months to this female in my life why it was so hard 4 me 2 trust her regardless of how sweet and innocent she portrayed herself to be and only after reading that chapter did she finally understand. This is some personal shit but I feel as though I can trust you so.... Okay there's that chapter where you were contemplating sharing this man with another woman. I'm in that position now. I love one woman  because she's dependable, loving, supportive, and she's young and open to me guiding her through this crazy life  Anyway woman ""A"" is from the streets and that's all she knows but I can see and feel how much she loves me. Woman ""B"" on the other hand is famous, rich, and able to assist me financially, loving, and very sexual. She's known me since before I got into the business and she's been there from the jump. However, she's bisexual and so into her career that we don't have much time together. So I'm literally torn between an old friend who went from being of a platonic nature to a potential wife and a new friend who has been there through the whole gunshot/rape/near death experience. I have rejected them both but then reconsidered and got 'em both back. They know of the other and I have tried to make it work as a threesome. Not sexually but commitment wise. Had I not read your book I would have continued living and juggling with all of these other women but between them both I completely satisfied. I've always felt that when I love someone it is so intense that I drive them away but with ""A"" and ""B"" it evens everything out. I can satisfy both of them and not because I'm a ""Supermanlove"" but because I truly love them both and the intensity and passion I feel for them keeps me driven to please them. Can u feel me? It's hard to explain on paper maybe when you visit me I can elaborate which brings me to my next step. Yes I would love 4 u 2 come visit me there isn't a list but there are certain days and times for each inmate. I'll attempt to reach you by phone to make it happen. Now back to me controlling my sexual desires. Now be honest, as a woman, how could you love a man that couldn't satisfy you? Since men are born totally inept sexually we only learn how 2 please a woman from pleasing a woman. So as rotten as it seems practice makes perfect. Every woman I have been with has not only taken what I learned from the last woman but taught me and prepared me for the next and since I am not married and yet to find the perfect woman you described I am forever in search of her. I have been with many married women from wives of powerful drug lords to the wives of broke everyday Joes to the wives of quite a few very famous and rich singers/actors and seeing their wives hungry for someone else has shown me that only by being able to completely satisfy a woman in every way, shape, and form can I truly find a happy and trusting faithful relationship. Now to answer your other questions. My health is fine I truly feel blessed that other than mentally I have no scars or lasting problems from my ""ordeal"". I still have the complete use of every nerve, limb, and muscle and more surprisingly I can still make love and have babies after taking a shot to my scrotum! Talk about faith in God! :)! Mentally however the helpless feeling never leaves me. I can't sleep! I wake up sweaty and disorientated when I do doze off and I will never erase the faces of my attackers from my mind. 2 be honest the bullets didn't hurt much not at first but afterwards it was painful. I didn't feel the shots in my head, hand, scrotum but because of all the muscles involved the leg wound was a real bitch! I don't really have any gun phobias meaning if it happened again I would react the same way. The pain came as I lay in the hospital thinking about the fact that some ""Thug"" brothers shot me. Then to hear I was found guilty of something I had not done plus wondering if my family was safe SCARED ME! Even with 5 gunshot wounds my paranoid ass was still sleeping with a 12 gauge and a Glock. I never planned to turn myself in I planned on shooting it out but upon further reflection I realized I owed alot to my people. Although I would have been at peace, the misery of our folks would continue. Besides I'm a Soldier and Soldiers use strategy not emotion no matter how bad the odds!

I can't explain it 
The way you make me feel 
The way you hold me 
The way you kiss me 



Why?
Why did I even dial your line?
Quietly I smile at your sweet reply
And as my eyes close
The ground beneath disappears
And all over again I feel a love
I know is real, so real


So high I can't look below
When you say my name I lose control
And I start to float
Ooh, I float
And whenever I want this feeling to go
I touch the sky and realize
One look in your eyes, I float


And I'm wonderin' if maybe you feel the same
Or am I all alone?
'Cause I'll pay almost any price
For the way you bring my heart to life, no lie
I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying
Finally could it be your love 
Specially made for me 
You see there's no one else
Who makes me feel the way you do
And I'm just ready 
Ready and waiting 
Waiting for you


So high I can't look below
When you say my name I lose control

And I start to float
Ooh, I float

Huh huh hey, yeah
Huh hey hey hey
Huh yeah hey, stop
Yeah yeah, come here
Come a little bit closer
Yes, right there
For real
I know you feel the same way
I see the way you look at me
Uh-huh, yeah
Never want this feeling to go away


So high I can't look below
When you say my name I lose control
And I start to float
Ooh, I float
And whenever I want this feeling to go 
I touch the sky and realize 
One look in your eyes, I float

"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you when you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

Yeah, for those that's locked in Comstock
My peoples sittin' in San Quentin and Clinton
Rikers Island, Rikers Island, Cracker's Island


I wake up to them rappin' tunes every afternoon
I be home soon, I see the board some time after June
Met a couple of convicts that's way beyond sick
It seem they dig my style 'cause I be on some Don shit
Laid back, I ran into some brothers from way back
Those I dug we hugged, besides that, black, I don't say jack
I stay in tune with the sun, stars and moon
'Cause behind bars you're doomed if your mind can't consume
Plus, spiritual pain can bring forth physical reign
And without knowledge of self, how else can a criminal change?
And being locked up just ain't the life for me
Shit is way too trife for me
""You're comin home soon"" sounds so nice to me
Plus, you can bet I'm bouncin' out with mad props
And if I get chopped or not, baby pop
My world don't stop





And in here it makes all end up the same from blowin' backs out
5 to 15, seein' the bean until they max out
Misbehavin', actin' uncivilized like cavemen
I witnessed brave men that gave in
Sodomized and turned to gay men
Nobody's playin drama, prisoners be posted preyin'
On some low shit layin', sleep, get your whole shit banged in
Hangin', plus who's to warn you
Out of the hell these inmates gone through
From three halves of a four group doubt if anyone is normal
And over all it's hard to call who would try to play you
My kid from my tomb's caught a carved spoon through his navel
Nothin' can save you, even C.O.'s'll try to grave you
It's painful to even know those who most faithful'll betray you
I lay low-key, cause I ain't Hercules
Tryin' to get out early on work release
Prayin' the system work with me
'Cause I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot
That ain't my plot, baby pop
My world don't stop





So until that day, I'm discharged and set free
Fuck who's gonna sex me
My mind's more based on makin' my next G
Now let's see, left alone me as a juvenile, no more movin' foul
The penile possessed me with a smoother style
Blessin' my mental with mathematics to map shit through graphics
Fuck it, I ain't with hustlin' backwards
A wiser man with ideas and liver plans
More mature and for sure done saw all my eyes can stand
Sittin', tryin' to design these words of mine
To define what occurs when you're servin' time
Stress just blurs the mind, behind bars, scars are signs of hard times
I'm trappin' myself in between these lines
But I ain't tryin' to see three hots and a cot till I rot
That ain't my plot, baby pop
My world don't stop





Yeah, representin'
For all the fellas on lock-diggedy
From upstate to downstate

To St. Louis, Missouri

For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want

Gave birth to my brother

Made 'em fight one another

I'd have to hustle just to make it through
So I found myself skipping school
Cause the girls don't think I'm cool
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause that's all I ever knew
Telling me I need to slow down
Cause everybody in the whole town
Cause they know how I get down

Tie-dyed shirts and Levi jeans
Looking cool at the Dairy Queen
Trying to impress a young woman in her Sunday dress


That was 1976, didn't know who I was yet
A pretty little blonde-haired girl
Stole my heart and changed my world
Two kids and a moonlite sky
A little love on a Friday night
Built a fire that just won't quit
And that was 1976


My high-school days are packed away
Set my sights on a bigger stage

Life seemed easy, nothing much that we needed

24/7 I'm back holding, mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out


I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down

Just lying on the beach and having fun

Sit there make me look guilty
You were leaving, anyway but with me
You have a career, I can tell
I trained you man, oh so well
No more boosting your ego

I need something strong tonight
I'm needing me a 100-proof
Something to erase my mind
Rid me of the thought of you


Ain't gonna water it down when I say it out loud
I'm gonna mean it when I'm telling you goodbye
You're lookin' in my eyes, but seeing somebody else
Yeah, I never should have fell


Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doin' me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her


Yeah, the grass ain't always greener
Over on the other side
You never learn when you're a leaver
It's just a part of your design


'Cause you're the kind that can't stay for too long in a sad place
You'll be looking for me when you change your mind

"You've told me to keep all my pride to myself
Just hide it away from the others you praised
To the end of my time, I will fight for what's right
A distinction of outbreaks alight

Get caught up inside the moment
In the silence and troubles we faced
But down beneath all of the hatred
Got burned inside the blaze
What you choose to defeat
All the fears I gotta beat
Feel the dark side emerging
From the fear inside of me

So why can't we fall for all what it's worth
What else can you do when you know that you're cursed
Truth is eternal but falsehood comes first
My haven is lost forever
So why won't we fall, can't stop my thirst
Ashes to ashes and dust turns to dirt
Reverse and rewind, cannot stop the tide
My haven is lost forever
My haven!

I'm counting the times when you forced me to hate
Didn't know just how easy a human can change
Take away every day for love and respect
Let revenge be your faith until death

Turn my grief into art
Tore my haven apart

So why can't we fall for all what it's worth
What else can you do when you know that you're cursed
Truth is eternal but falsehood comes first

See, I don't like a motherfucker that be all lonely and shit
All up under me, tellin' me we havin' gold
In case she gold ringin' when I'm comin' home
And all of that ol' crazy shit, what type of life I live


Now peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga every time I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture: me and you in ecstasy?
Don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
Do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest?
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
You can call me when you need me
1-800-SKYPAGE, when you wanna see me
'Cause I can be your man and, baby, you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy

You know


Now me and you was cool, but I ain't the one to play the fool
Can't make no money in bed, so ain't no future fuckin' you
I ain't the bitch to love ya, can't do a damn thang for you
If you ain't about money, nine times outta ten I'll ignore you
It's a man's world, but real women make the shit go 'round
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
Throw up the block 'cause nothin' stops my chips
I boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks
Holla if you understand my plan, ladies, fuck havin' babies
By them shady-ass niggas, swearin' he can save me
My strategy's official, checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss you
Soft as tissue, so my next issue is how to diss you
They call me Storm, from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest mothafucka 'til his heart's warm
I ain't never been the type to wait at home alone
Just 'cause we bone don't mean you own me, nigga, I'm grown

Let a nigga hang out with the homies, you know, baby

Don't have a nigga all up under you!
Let him run with his niggas!
Let the nigga run the street, boo, let him run the streets!


I'd rather run the streets than make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm choosin'
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B
Fetti over somethin' that's tellin' me don't run the streets


So tell me, am I wrong
For tryin' to communicate through a song?
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3' and don't be late, nigga
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in 'cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die I'll be gang related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it, it's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, 'cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil nigga tryna make it
I only got one chance so I gotta take it
You never know when it's all gonna happen
The rappin' or the drugs
But until then give me love and let me run the streets

So you don't believe a nigga?
Just cook for a nigga, pleaaase!
Make some of that shit you made last meal
Some of them ribs and shit
I'll be back through later tonight, I'm havin' some weed
We finna drink some Hennessy and some Alize
We finna eat that foods, smoke a lil blunt
Lay up in the bed, watch out Jay Leno or somethin'
Then after that, shit, do whatever comes to mind, baby
Just let a nigga run with the homies
Let me go kick it with my niggas
When I come back, I be all yours, for real

The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from
Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books and one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs
With a Christian sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one learned to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
My brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole life saving souls
When he looked at me and his look ran cold
He didn't even try
I had no dreams and I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
Warden said 'How come you killed that man?'
I said 'I don't know why'
Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one wants to die
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white
Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my moral soul be blessed
By someone close to me
I came to him with trembling hands
I swore I'd never understand
He said its just what life had planned
It's destiny
So don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
You chose the dark, I chase the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white


The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain

Any comments? I thought so
You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
Step your game up
I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes
SoundScan'll never read your albums again 
I take 99.9% of your fans
The last one left is your moms 
Ain't nothing gifted about you
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you

Be the reason my heart's bleeding
I'm coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom
The application of your knowledge is me
Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
Y'all don't hear me, y'all fear me like a doomsday prophet
When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
I leave you off the Earth's surface, that's what you get
For trying to test my patience like nurses
This ain't a verse this is a Kennedy curse
Put your brain on your lady's purses, you niggas crazy

Baby Britain feels the best
Floating over a sea of vodka
Separated from the rest
Fights problems with bigger problems
Sees the ocean fall and rise
Counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her
Water pouring from her eyes
Alcoholic and very bitter


For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help until you start


We knocked another couple back
The dead soldiers lined up on the table
Still prepared for an attack
They didn't know they'd been disabled
Felt a wave, a rush of blood
You won't be happy 'til the bottle's broken
You're out swimming in the flood
You kept back, you kept unspoken


For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help you until you start


You got a look in your eye
When you're saying goodbye
Like you wanna say hi


The light was on but it was dim
Revolver's been turned over
And now it's ready once again
The radio was playing 'Crimson and Clover'
London Bridge is safe and sound
No matter what you keep repeating
Nothing's gonna drag me down
To a death that's not worth cheating

You can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha ha, pussy


It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down


""The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around""
That's Ja's little punk ass thinking out loud

I'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack Child
Them niggas dead, they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back better than ever on top of my game
Even them country boys saying ""50 we feeling you, mane""
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy


It's easy to see when you look at me

I ain’t gonna' tell nobody you getting extorted
I've been patiently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ""The 50 Cent Show""
This is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down cause you fear for your life
But you heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, nigga

I know, I know


Oh no, he didn't say anything about Ja
Okay? Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put their hands on Jeffrey
Okay, first of all, they don't know that I am a 12 degree pink belt
Okay, I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery
Okay, cause see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?

For a hubcap rolling into the fields of thorn

Took us by surprise

Unstoppable
I know that you want me to fail
But no I won't
I'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box
Until I sit in Heaven I will never stop
I will never stop


After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'Til I make it, yo, my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to niggas too scary, get too near me, we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, visions of niggas thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
Psssh! Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It’s like I’m - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked 45, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn, now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan


I am unstoppable
I know that you want me to fail
But no I won't
I'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box
Until I sit in Heaven I will never stop
I will never stop


I got a handgun habit, nigga front I'll let you have it
When the shots go off, cops sayin 50 back at it
I'm allergic to the feathers on these bird-ass niggas
Front and I'll put your brains on that curb fast nigga
I ain't a marksman, one spark and I spray shit
Nuff rounds from that H-K, I don't play bitch
Move like I'm militant, back on that gorilla shit
Moody, disrespectful, unruly, but niggas can't move me
I squeeze till I run out of ammo, if it's a problem it's handled
I have your people pourin' our liquor and lightin' candles
You fuck around I blow your brains on my New York Times
Run home, turn to the sports section and read your mind
It's crystal clear, you should feel when that gat bust
First there's crime scene tape, then you end up in that black hearse
We don't go to funerals, but we'll go to your wake fam
Do your body all banged up,  you made a mistake man


I am unstoppable
I know that you want me to fail
But no I won't
I'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box
Until I sit in Heaven I will never stop
I will never stop




There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause that's sort of unique cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass


I am unstoppable
I know that you want me to fail
But no I won't

And the trouble makers riding on the back of the bus

Dear God, I'm a good Christian man
In your glory, I know you understand
That you gotta work hard and you gotta get paid

Oh Lord, if you could see her when she's up on that stage!

You know that I'm a God-fearing man
You know that I'm a God-fearing man
But I just gotta know if its part of your plan
To seat my daughters there by your right hand
I know that you'll do what is right, Lord
For they are the lanterns, and you are the light

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Tell me what to say
I'll be your mouthpiece!

Into the light of a bridge that burns
As I drive from the city with the money that I earned
Into the dark of a starless sky
I'm staring into nothing and I'm asking you why:
Lord, will you make her a star?
So the world can see who you really are

Little girl, you're old enough to understand
That you'll always be a stranger in a strange, strange land
The men are gonna come while you're fast asleep
So you better just stay close and hold on to me
If my little mocking bird don't sing
Then daddy won't buy her no diamond ring

Dear God, would you send me a child?
Oh God, would you send me a child?
'Cause I wanna put it up on the TV screen
So the world can see what your true word means
Lord, would you just send me a sign?
'Cause I just gotta know if I'm wasting my time!

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Now the war is won
How come nothing tastes good?

You're such a sensitive child!
Oh, you're such a sensitive child!
I know you're tired but it's alright
I just need you to sing for me tonight
You're gonna have your day in the sun;
You know God loves the sensitive ones

Oh! My little bird in a cage!
Oh! My little bird in a cage!
I need you to get up for me, up on that stage
And show the men that you're old for your age
Now ain't the time for fear
But if you don't take it, it will disappear

Oh! My little mockingbird sing!
Oh! My little mockingbird sing!
I need you to get up on that stage for me, honey
And show the men it's not about the money

Wanna hold a mirror up to the world
So that they can see themselves inside my little girl

Do you know where I was at your age?
Any idea where I was at your age?
I was working downtown for the minimum wage
And I'm not gonna let you just throw it all away
I'm through being cute, I'm through being nice

Summoned the gods and they all agreed

Keep on trying to pin me down

We are each other’s hemispheres
I am fine tuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance


Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation
Learning by love to open it up
Let this ugly wound breathe
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance


When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me
We are each other’s hemispheres


We aim at peeling off
Dead layers of loveless love
No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Most hearts, they fear their own home
Becoming themselves fully
It scares them off


When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me


No one is a lover alone, lone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
The atoms are dancing, dancing


No one is a lover alone, lone

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven


Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder


There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking


Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder


And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter


If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on


And it makes me wonder
Ohhhh, woah


Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind




And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll


And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Dress up in a pinstripe suit
Smoke a custom-made cigar
Wear an alligator boot

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin’ home to a place he’d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin’ by a song
But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care
It keeps changin’ fast and it don’t last for long


But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky Mountain high

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down

I saw a beautiful girl on the street
She looked nothing like me, I think
But I wanted to call you and tell you about
The way that her hair got caught in her mouth
I saw the wing of a bird on the road
It was early, I was walking alone
And I found it lovely, and I found it sad
I don't know how you'd find it, but I wanted to ask


Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you


And at the bar, on TV
They were talking about the casualties
Four hundred and counting, and my only question
Was, ""How would you feel if one was me?""
Would you wish we'd made love again?
Would you want to revisit the marks on my skin?
'Cause the world could be burning, and all I'd be thinking
Is, ""How are you doing, baby?""


Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me

I know you don't like my long face
I am only here to tell you
That I am eviscerated
I'm sorry to be so serious

You are wildfire, and I'm standing in the rain
After everything, everything

Lurch at the sight of the clandestine ascendancy

Crave for the pristine light

Sown into deep darkness

To wander off in shame

My misery has enjoyed company
And although I have ached, I don't threaten anybody
Sometimes I feel more bigness than I've shared with you
Sometimes I wonder why I quell
When I'm not required to
I've tried to be small
I've tried to be stunted
I've tried roadblocks and all
My happy endings prevented
Sometimes I feel it's all just too big
To be true
I sabotage myself for fear of what
My bigness could do


Fear of bliss and
Fear of joytude
Fear of bigness
And ensuing solitude


I could be golden
I could be glowing
I could be freedom
But that could be boring
Sometimes I feel this is just too scary
To be true
I sabotage myself for fear of losing
You


Fear of bliss and
Fear of joytude
Fear of bigness
And ensuing solitude


This talk of liberation makes me want
To go lie down
Under the covers til the terror of the
Unknown is gone


I could be full
I could be thriving
I could be shining
Sounds isolating
Sometimes I feel this is too good
To be true
I sabotage myself for fear of what
My joy could do

Fear of joytude
Fear of bigness
And ensuing solitude

If I spend all of my money, then I've got no money left
If I place all of my chips on only one bet
I'm all in

And it's a surefire bet I'm gonna die
So I'm takin' up praying on Sunday nights
And it's not that I believe in your almight'
But I might as well as insurance or bail

'Cause institution's like a big bright lie
And it blinds you into fear and consuming and fighting
But in the desert underneath the charging sky
It's just you and God
But what if God's not there?
But his name is on your dollar bill
Which just became cab fare

For the Evangelists, the Communists, and the Lefts and the Rights
And the hypocrites and the Jesuits, and the blacks and the whites
It's in the belly of the beast
In the Atlanta streets
Or up in Laurel Canyon
The verge of Middle East

Still they're dying on the dark continent
It's been happening long enough to mention it
Have I mentioned my parents are getting back together again
It's been 25 years
Of spreading infection
Somehow we're not affected

So my mom, she brushes her hair
And my dad starts growing Bob Dylan's beard
And I share with my friends a couple of beers
In the Orlando streets
In the belly of the beast

It's never fine when you go away
These cuts run deep, these scars are permanent and always on display
This makes things difficult for me

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made


But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful


Oh, oh, oh

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within


There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark

Sperduti nel mare io e lei

Io remo pensando ai fatti miei
Sarebbe il momento proprio giusto
Rovesci la barca e lei va giù
Ma dopo da solo cosa faccio
Io senza di lei non vivo più

Voi cuori di pietra come fate
Voi che ammazzate la gente per sport
La guardo non sembra neanche più scema
Sfiorarla di baci io vorrei
Son cose neanche da pensare
Ti beccano tutti prima o poi
È dentro di voi che dovete ammazzare
Il vostro pensiero se perde l'amor

Due piccole onde la svegliano piano
Non parla mi guarda che cos'ha ?
Se certo non fossi che lei mi vuol bene
Direi che la pelle mi vuol far
Son cose nanche da pensare
Son bravo a nuotare e lei lo sa
Non so cosa ho fatto più che remare
Stasera se vuole la porto anche al night

You going on dates, we tryna get this cake!""
When the pressure gets to setting in
""If you a real man, you would fuck her friend""
Head saying no, other one saying yes
His girl girlfriend been with it, it's scandalous
Unfasten her clothes, she swore she won't tell a soul
The thrill of it all got him off, case closed

But she ain't having the best luck
Everybody who chop it up only want a cut
One of her girlfriends got one
She been jealous of the relationship since day one
But last week he made a pass at her
She knew she had him, her ass a little fatter
Unbuttoned his jeans and then she fell to her knees
She finally found company for her misery

I have cried so many times

I can't regret time spent with you

After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again

Oh!
I know that I will never disappoint myself

If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!

Yeah! You hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way

I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I

Your hair has turned to silver
I know you're fading too
Daddy, dear old daddy
I'm comin' back to you
Made my boyhood happy
Still, I longed to roam
I've a-had my way, but now I'll stay
I long for you and for home


Daddy, you shared my sorrows and joys
You tried to bring me up right
But still I remember yous a-one of the boys
Now I'm starting back home tonight


Your hair has turned to silver
I know you're fadin' too
Daddy, dear old daddy
I'm comin' back to you
Did my boyhood happy
Still, I longed to roam
I've a-had my way, but now I'll stay
I long for you and for home


This here's the last verse
His papa's hair had turned to silver when he got home


I'm dreaming tonight of an old Southern town
The best friend I ever had
Been wonderin' and worryin' and rovin' 'round
Now I'm goin' back home to my dad


Your hair has turned to silver
I know you're fading too

Come on!

So now my son is in the hands of a murderer
If you think you'll ever get away with this, you'll have another thing coming

I'll do all that it takes to get to you
This is my flesh and blood, my one and only son
Now losing's not an option
It looks like fighting for you, is what I've come to do

I'm running my legs against the clock
Every moment that passes by, could be a moment you'll win
I don't know where to start, but I know where it will end...
With you back in my arms

And when I find you
I'm gonna teach you
What the meaning of pain is
I won't stop til' it's over

'Til 6 o'clock in the morning we was going in, like shots shots shots
Hit it from the back on my end tops

'Bout to go down, something like a drop top
Taste so sweet, I'll be calling that a Pop Tart 
Just let me rock

Hard for me to ignore, but I'm really all into you
Staring in your eyes, hugging on your waist like a man should
Can't wait for you to come over, let's get it started on the sofa
Hot thighs, long, strong loving, girl, I'm gonna put it on you
And I'm here to represent, girl
Leave you lying there shaking 'til you just can't take it
And I'm here to put it down, girl
Let me work on you, go to work on you

Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere, anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath


Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep


A song in every breath


Remember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby


Sing me to sleep now

Won't you sing me to sleep now?

"VERSE 1:
I made our house a home
We built a little studio of green and gold
Your song so pure of heart
How was I to know?
Deception was really your art

CHORUS:
Living with the madness
Of the truth
Living with the gladness
That god blessed to you
With a little angel
I love as my own
So I say hail
Hail to the wrong

VERSE 2:
I can't be mad at you
I'm the one who closed my eyes
At the things you do
Now my life is bright and new
As long as I live
I'll pray for the baby and you

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
I promised you I'd write this song
Thanks for the lesson
Since you were gone
What you did wrong
Became a blessing
You deceived, I believed
Never questioning
But the beauty that came from the wrong that you did
Only made me stronger

 see the reaper creepin' as my blood is seeping
Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons
 weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing
Death keeps cheating on my life, but on my soul, it's feeding

Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain, this torture of horror
That I'm always conceiving







Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead

Eternal rest, the bloody mess
Keepin' the motherfucking devil hot
Satanic mentality, happily makin' the bodies drop
I'm on the block, circling cops
Ready for their demise
Screams resonate through the night, so I can't close my eyes
Hard to swallow when the hollows enter through your throat
Lately, I wallow in my sorrow 'cause I cannot cope
The dope, the coke, the drank, the lean
The pills, the X, the smoke
The rope to choke the pain away, I'm broken till I croak, hoe


Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead


Baby, let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Baby, let me get the weed, there's more for us
When these suckers leave, yeah, we can smoke a blunt and fuck
I bust a nut, and now it's time to get the fuck up out my crib
Yeah, here's a couple bucks
Bitch, I'm Oddy Nuff, creepin' out the cut
Blood seepin' out my cut
With the shotty, 'cause you might escape the Tommy gun
Because I'm busy puffin' blunts
But soon enough, you'll come back round
You screamin', ""lock me up—please, box me up!""
I got you, sucker
Start a flame, and turn your body into dust
Smoke your body in the blunt, copy us, I'll light it up

Walk in with a dead bitch, and a Swisher lit, drug kit
Got a half-hit worth of acid, can't quit, I'm an addict
So traumatic, and I'm manic
Feeling panicked, I need a Xanax

Lonely, looking ghostly
Surrounded by smoky mirror images of a fictionist, sober me

Take a hit of acid, been a while since I tripped
Now I'm seein' all this shit, brain glowing
Everything is bending in the same motion
Roll the blunt, I'll take a hit
Start staring at the smoke, as it twists and disappears
Peer pressure don't affect me, bitch, I take drugs on my own
Pop a perc' and snort some coke
It feel like my heart is broke because I get fucked up when I feel alone
I'm choking on this forty of OE, I'm hopin' that I don't breathe
Bitch, I'm dope, act like you know me
Shoot me up so I can OD

Next time, slow it down and don't feel you have to rush

And before you leave
Remember I was with you

Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved


We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love

Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville

First degree and second degree
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?""


Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they sent me back
I had no one to go my bail
They crammed me back into the county jail

The judge had the papers in his right hand

Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes

Pop a tag, grab a garbage bag to split my cigars in
F's in the carpet go with my Fendi garment
Watchin’ Game Time, who had 50, that was Harden
Throwin' gang signs, gettin' busy at the garden
Shorty Facetime, real pretty, and she dark skinned
They lost a margin, a big cut
Caught slimin’ at the pick up
Wonder why he ain't pick up
They found five in his pick up
Where you at? Let's get up
Need to know where that coke go
And was it the boys? Was it the niggas we both know?
I'm like oh no, load six in the .44
Grab me the 12 gage, hit it right in low coat
They low though at a loft in Soho
Tell 'em we want it back, pay double the 


I ain't with that, we can rap when I get back
Gather the click clacks, call on who to go kidnap
Snatch a six pack, get low and just sit back
We never panic, we got mechanics to fix that
This that real shit, gotta let niggas kill shit
Make 'em feel it, let 'em know that it’s still lit
Designer lace, them pretty Porsches in our ace
The city’s nauseous, they see the fortress as high stakes
Annihilate, violation, they out of place
Accommodate, take whatever out of the safe
It's the game though, back and forth, the same old
Friend or foe, we at the end of the rainbow
Say it ain’t so, not a talk on my thing show
I been about it since British walkers and Kangos
In a Range Rove, holler back when I change clothes
So we can creep on the streets and let these lames know


So that's the angle? I try time with cables
Make 'em lie on the table then put the iron in his naval
What's the time they gave you? We at the diner on Maple
Know my slimes is able, a bunch of lions and bengals
Tired of serachin’, ridin' around conversion
On my mind's the urge to see slime in person
I can't wait, what's the plan ay? Let's go with plan A
Meet up with gang day, headshots soon as we handshake
It's simple, play like you cripple wearin' a trench coat
See me talkin', speed up the walkin', and let the fifth go
Keep it movin', pass up the tool, and that's when you get ghost
Start manoeuvrin', later we coolin' and have her big toast
It's the lifestyle just follow lead
So take it off or die in ring, Apollo Creed
It's 'bout survival, you lift the rifle, you gotta squeeze
On the Bible, could win the title if you got a team

With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks

It's only been a week
The rush of being home in rapid fading
Prevailing to recall
What I was missing all that time in England
Has sent me aimlessly
On foot or by the help of transportation
To knock on windows where
A friend no longer lived, I had forgotten


And everywhere I go
There's always something to remind me
Of another place in time
Where love that traveled far had found me


We stayed outside 'til two
Waiting for the light to come back
We didn't talk, I knew
Until you asked what I was thinking
Until you asked what I was thinking


Brave men tell the truth
The wise man's tools are analogies and puzzles
A woman holds her tongue
Knowing silence will speak for her

For days and days
In so many different manners

I used to think this dream we shared
Would never come apart

I used to sing this song to you

Tore me all apart

You're not what I need anymore
Forget those games you're playin'
You're not what I need anymore
I can't hear what you're saying


If you won't listen to me
How can you tell me how I feel?
All along I told you
That I cannot feel the pain


Who are you to tell me
I'm not good enough?
All I've ever wanted was a place
Inside of you


Why should I hear what you say any longer?
When you don't even know where I've been
I feel something in me getting stronger
And I won't get kicked around again

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin' measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love

You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor

Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?

See I met her at club on the Friday
Big booty, small waist
Seeing her coming my way
So I had to bag her
I really had to have her 
I didn't see a ring on her finger
I asked her have you ever been with a singer before
She said no 
So let me introduce you to my world
Big diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl

Bet you ain't never seen before
Saw around the world
I got them coming back for more


And thats when I noticed
People are watching!
But we dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care 
See I bet youre nasty
When youre on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!


Got shorty right where I want her
Strapped up, hands trapped in the corner
Grinding slow, and I won't let go 
Baby more better than ammonia
Feeling tipsy from the bottle of Corona 
She probably let go 
She said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world
She whispers some words
That damn near made my toes curl
She said shes got that
That I have never seen before
And if I get the taste
Ill be coming right back for more

Pssst... psssssst... ayo
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever?
Tell me, which one?


They wanna bury me, I'm worried, I'm losin' my mind
Look down the barrel of my 9, and my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me, unfortunately, ‘cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless
I'm chokin' off marijuana smoke
With every toke it's like I'm losin' focus
Fallin' asleep while I'm in service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous, because I'm high
Don't mention funerals, I'm stressin' and goin' nutty
And reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
I wonder: When will I be happy? Ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money
Where am I goin'? I discovered, can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it
Everybody's dyin', am I next? Who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin'?
Two to the head while I'm in bed
Leakin' blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller?
I'm gettin' suspicious of this bitch
The line's busy every time I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later!
To all the players, watch the fly way a nigga played her
This bitch is tellin' all her homies
That I can fuck her like no other
Now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure, gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drank a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies, they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the 5-0's roll, the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
I put up my middle finger, then I dash
Niggas don't like me, ‘cause I'm thuggin'
And every day I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid


They wanna bury me, I'm worried—no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest, I'm losin' homies—ain't that a bitch?
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord, are you there?
Then tell me, am I lost? ‘Cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends, but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run, I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound
Well, Hell can't be worse than this, ‘cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you, I don't want to, but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin' MAC
-11, ‘cause in Heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin' you now: ''You motherfuckers don't know me''


Only fear of death... you ghetto niggas
Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated

Out the window on some ""Uptown Anthem"" shit

I'm different, and I'ma prove it if it take me to die

But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch

And come through cockin' the black pound

With the crooked dial checks, I'm supposed to wild sex

You end up in a box, ‘cause them graverobbin' bastards

Worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the Pac keepin' the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know you're goons
That's why I keep pressure on them, like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin', songs are evolution
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out at some other niggas, you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin' – I'm clever, stupid!
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless
You got the same bullets that you had when I loaded it for you
You never used it; the Nacirema dream get ready for execution

What will we hear there

As another day grows live

"Everyone dated the demise of our neighborhood
From the suicides of the Lisbon girls
People saw their clairvoyance in the wiped out elms
And the harsh sunlight
Some thought the tortures tearing the Lisbon girls
Pointed to a simple refusal to accept the world
As it was handed down to them
So full of flaws
But the only thing we are certain of
After all these years
Is the insufficiency of explanation


The Lisbon girls were
Thirteen, Cecilia
Fourteen, Lux
Fifteen, Bonnie
Sixteen, Mary
And seventeen, Therese
No one could understand how
Mrs. Lisbon and Mr. Lisbon
Our math teacher
Had produced such beautiful creatures

From that time on
The Lisbon house began to change
Almost everyday
And even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia
Lux would suntan on a towel
Wearing a swimsuit that caused the knife sharpener
To give her a 15 minute demonstration for free

The only reliable boy who got to know Lux
Was Trip Fontaine
Who only 18 months before the suicides
Had emerged from baby fat
To the delight of girls and mothers alike
But few anticipated it would be so drastic
The girls were pulled out of school
And Mrs Lisbon shut the house in maximum security isolation
The girls' only contact with the outside world
Was through the catalogs they ordered
That started to fill the Lisbon's mailbox
With pictures of high-end fashions and brochures for exotic vacations

Unable to go anywhere
The girls traveled in their imaginations
To gold tipped Siamese temples, or past an old man with a leaf broom
Tiding a moss-carpeted speck of Japan
And Cecilia hadn't died
She was a bride in Calcutta
Collecting everything we could of theirs
We couldn't get the Lisbon girls out of our minds
But they were slipping away
The colours of their eyes were fading
Along with exact locations of moles and dimples

From five they had become four
And they were all living in the dead
Becoming shadows
We would have lost them completely
If the girls hadn't contacted us
Lux was the last to go
Fleeing from the house we had forgot to stop at the garage

After the suicide free-for-all
Mr and Mrs. Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life
They had Mr Hedly pack up the house
Selling what furniture he could in a garage sale
Everyone went just to look
Our parents did not buy used furniture
And they certainly didn't buy furniture tainted by death
We, of course, took the family photos that were put out with the trash
Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market
And it was sold to a young couple from Boston

It didn't matter in the end how old they had been
Or that they were girls
But only that we had loved them
And they hadn't heard us calling..still do not hear us
Calling them out of those rooms
Where they went to be alone for all time
Alone in suicide
Which is deeper then death
And where we will never find the pieces
To put them back together

And then they sent me on my way
I left my love and forgot my dreams
I lost them along the way


Those little things you say
When words mean so much
You never back down
And they all shy away
You always listen to me


And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights?
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight?
And what do I see?
The only thing that gets me through
This is what I feel and I feel you


And this ain't no bed of nails
But they're not roses just the same
God, this road sure can be long
Another endless day, another seven hundred miles
That'll take me further from my home

When words mean so much

You captured me smiling

Is our silver lining

Whistling Elvis, striding through the snow

Lasting forever

The final bell concealed a body blow


Look at me now, you'd say
Drowning in sorrow
I guess I got lost today
But there's always tomorrow

Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side

The Indians fell

And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes

With guns in their hands
And God on their side

It came and it went
The reason for fightin'
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side

The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side

I’ve learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side

But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When God’s on your side

Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for ya'
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side

So now as I’m leavin'

Rap game, heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer wit' us
Niggas wanna be L, ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail you'll wear a shirt sayin' ""Free L!""
What

Oh shit
Yo be careful with that man it's loaded
I'll hold on to the gun
Why should he hold on to the gun?
Cuz I already got it motherfucker!


It's not a game it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall, when I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin
Unless you got my ends, I'mma make you twins with the Headless Horseman
Hell extortion, sell your soul, live your dreams
Don't pay the cost then  say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Give me your fear, murder, respect, beer, honies and sex want here
I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin with Chris - fuck Pun - dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, go 'head Decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggas I keep, I put em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill
You fuckin with reel to reel, rap axe maniac
Sound bwoy killer, hack hack chain-react
Two for one - double the death, same price
What would Big say? ""Huh, you know that ain't right""

Yo you got the juice now



Excuse me partner can you keep that shit down you see me watching TV

Made it ma ... made it ma
Top of the world  top of the world

If you gotta go out ... that's how you go out. That motherfucker took his destiny in his own hands

"Why don't you try to do without him?
Why don't you try to live alone?
Do you really need his hands for your passion?
Do you really need his heart for your throne?

Do you need his labour for your baby?
Do you need his beast for the bone?
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady?
I know that you can make it, make it on your own

Why don't your try to forget him?
Just open up your dainty little hand
This life is filled with many sweet companions
Many satisfying one-night stands

Do you want to be the ditch around a tower?
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave?
Do you want to give your blessings to his power
As he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave?

I'd like to take you to the ceremony
That is, if I remember the way
You see, Jack and Jill, they're going to join their misery
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray

You can see they've finally taken cover
You can see they're willing to obey
Their vows are difficult, they're for each other
So let nobody put a loophole, a loophole in their way

"Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us

That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale

So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below

When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness

And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes

And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
""Space enough"" said Baal, ""then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb""

Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much

Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you

Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep

Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup

When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead

Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us

I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day


Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep, the sounds awake me
I let them take me



Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry




Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day


Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me



Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry




Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry


Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when the day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me

I let the music speak

Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why from me
Me and the baby and you side by side

Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the state line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must have known what we were going to find

Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time

It can make you cuss
It can make you sing

I've seen them fall

And Lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawl away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm going to need you
Down this yellow brick road

Fall short this time of goals you rose to meet that night
Don't worry yourselves, worry yourselves

How does it feel to wake up
Knowing that you're playing on something
That could have been nothing but a sad, sad song
About a group of kids who lost it all to the great big city


Are we both crazy?
Or are we searching for more than life behind the same four walls
Pour me another drink I'll commit myself to it
And lose track of reason to believe in nothing


I know this is ridiculous, that's just like me
Make the most of living while you're young
And have the chance to take your chances
Cause I've got to, I've got to go


Don't be afraid, I've got your back
When times get rough and bring you down
Maybe you don't understand
We've got to take this or break this off
It's all up to us and you better believe

We're all just searching for more

Swear to god if you come up in my mama yard

Work hard, play hard, work hard again
My bankroll had twins, can you comprehend?
Seafood lover, I don't eat pork
Used to hit them J's like a 3-point, my partner mascot is a pitchfork
And you already know what this for - me too, rent due
Doggin' these hoes like a shih tzu so cold I recorded in a igloo
Nigga asked me why I don't drink, man, let me tell you what the wine do
My partner came in and said ""This my girl"", I had to tell that motherfucker ""Mine too!""
Court dates in the summertime, might pull up in a vert
No matter what the charges is, I'mma pull off with a smirk

This right here for Riverdale, trappin' at the Stop-N-Go
Trappin' at the Texaco, it was Amaco before it was BP
My plug from Mexico, he fell out when he seen me on TV
Sold drugs to my loved ones and it's hard for me to admit it
The first time I've seen a crack pipe was in my parents' kitchen

The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down


T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold


The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near


Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home


The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love


The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld


Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind


Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap


He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long


He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep


Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around


The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside


Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull


The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart


Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last


The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done


The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees


Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside


Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?


His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene


The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere


Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side


Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers


The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life


Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark


Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance


They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks


The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""


Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world


Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him


He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace


They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold


Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had


He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm


Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on


The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go


There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before


The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone


The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel


He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race


In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears


When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best


They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand


The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course


The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea

I'm so sick of muthafuckas askin' me
How our parents feel about us
Calling these hoes bitches
So Aunt Glo
Why don't you tell them how we do it

I'm tired of these bitches calling my house
Asking for the Young Thugz

Young Thugz ain't got time for no bitches
They trying to get rich
Stop calling



Baby!




Now it's been a long, day
I'm straight hustling to getting pay
But now it's evening, and I'm scheming of play
I got a call, from that Dogg nigga K


And I was bored, so nigga I'll be on my way
Who got the hoes for Hollywood? I think he might
And I suppose, nigga we up in the night


That's right them  be staring
With Lil Moo in the cut and that nigga all in


So what the fucking drink had me tripping
But I'll be damned if I let another motherfucker catch me slipping
We've been in the car nigga


We in the drive way
Because the night is young and I'm ready to hit the highway
And now it's all for that
These night call's we strapped
You know how niggas be black


Now we smoking weed that we need
So let's get the game right
And baked tight in the late night


Preoccupied with
Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all
Everyday is a bit of play
Getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day
Preoccupied with
Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all

Getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day




Now it's 206 tell me
Who the fuck I'm having sex with?
Gaming these cousin's in the Lexus from Texas


Expect to last past 6 'cause I'm restless
My head blasted off this Sess that I mess with


The best, click is who we choose so we making moves
Ain't in no mood for no faking moves
So is it true?
I'm asking now
'Cause if not, you and your crew could be stashed and out


Without a doubt
These bitches know we do it right
Fuck it and they suck us
That's how we do it on the late night


Bitches don't even have a clue
I keep up with my scandalous crew
Boxes of blunts and brew, well can you handle this too?
Step up and let me put this pimping in your ear
The game is clear, this place is packed, let's disappear
Now we can hit the highway and go to my place
But be cautious
Once we arrive can I toss it?
No hesitation, this fornication and situation
Fucking these hoes up to the attic, back down to the basement
No replacement, I hit you with a piece then I flee
Back to the streets is how I do it, ain't no peace for a G
And my motto, a blunt some coochie and a cold bottle
I'm fucking them hoochies and the supermodels
The game is deep, I can't sleep 'cause there's cum on my sheets
Sampling bitches like a break beat, the liquor makes me
And when it's late I'm like a convict that just escaped
Hitting these hoochies 'til they break, in the late night



Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling?
I'm sick of hoes nigga fuck 'em all 
Everyday is a bit of play, getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day

And there's no more tears


And no more sadden eyes
From crying through the night
Gonna gather up, gather up my feelings
And lock them all inside
So when you say you're leaving
And you walk out my door
I got to move and say to myself
You cannot hurt me anymore

But instead I'm slowly dying

From two hearts so badly torn

Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise 
My ghetto queen, rise 
Don't be afraid to try 
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We continue growing
One day at a time


Take time, it's gonna take time
Ya'll try not to be anxious and bless our way
Take time, it's gonna take time
Take it one day at a time and live longer days
Take time, it's gonna take time
The only way to make it is if we pray
One day at a time


No matter how much money you make, Please listen
It ain't no life without struggling kid
Running, ducking a bid
Feeling like there's nothing to live for
We're all diamonds in the eyes of the Lord
They say the good die young on the road to glory
I guess God spared some of us to tell a story
The death of the past is the life of the future
We Outlaw soldiers, the voice of the people


Everybody talking bout the game like they can't see the casualties
Living in this world of animosity
And jealously got em after me
Lord don't let em capture me
I'm paranoid and I'm looking for somewhere to go
And I feel like I'm bout to blow
And I don't wanna be broke no mo
I don't wanna be broke no mo


You know it takes time to free your body and your mind
Get up on your grind
Change the situation
No sense of crime, cause we're all God's child
Don't lose your mind, gotta have patience
Every day is a test
Every day your breathing you're blessed
Another day to succeed and be the best
For the Prince, Kadafi and Makaveli the Don

I'mma make the call, and I hope you respond
We the stars y'all, and everyone beckons far
You a star and you shining, I'm one and I'm rhyming
Let's get together, start intertwining
Yo you coming with me, somewhere where you can't see
With his bonafide joints, underneath the sea
Of confusion and glitter, nobody's a quitter
Try to front and get ripped, from your ear to your shitter
Gon' put it on harder than anyone did
It would benefit you to keep a wide open lid
Makin sho' shot shit, makin sure you shine
Takin shows for sure, takin hearts in time
Do it all for the rhyme, and the rhythm and things
When we do it we bangin, like we inside the bank
Ain't doubtin nobody, when we inside the jam
But I'm proud overall, and I know who I am
As the constellation gets brighter this writer's goin

 do it  do it
 do it  do it
 do it  do it
 do it  do it

"I tried to move with a cool hand
It didn’t go as I planned
I’m full of rookie maneuvers
And gestures meant to be grand
I tried a bag of tricks one after another
I asked if you heard of my band

So misguided
The sincere approach, never tried it once

You said to just drop the game flat
Why didn’t I think of that?

My daisy
You make me go crazy
Forever amaze me
Now let’s let the day go lazy
My daisy
You know what I’m after
Your musical laughter
A more beautiful disaster

I can’t believe what you create
When you let your heart detonate
You let your mind go with one blast then another
And, what comes next I will await

Tell me again the one about the time
We first got together and you blew my mind

I find my mind in the gutter
When I think of my daisy cutter

My daisy
You make me go crazy
Forever amaze me
Now let’s let the day go lazy
My daisy
You know what I’m after
Your musical laughter
A more beautiful disaster

It’s four months now since you crashed into my life 
You leave a path of delightful destruction you’re quite the bomb my daisy

Clap your hands
Get down to the beat
Clap you hands
Just clap your hands to the beat

My daisy
You make me go crazy
Forever amaze me
Now let’s let the day go lazy
My daisy
You know what I’m after
Your musical laughter
A more beautiful disaster

My daisy, you know just what I’m after
You make my heart beat so much faster
My daisy, you know you drive me crazy
You just blow me away my daisy

Now it's time to sit back and enjoy creation
See what Jah has done
Every time she tops me off, it's celebration, yeah
What has life become?
And we don't talk too much
Could this be a strange new love I've got
Plus she's always got that loud pack
Inspiration for this soundtrack
Every time she throws that ass back, all she says is


Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away


Every time I go inside of your protected
Place with reverence
I'm reminded of a time I was neglected
It seems you're heaven sent
She loves to top me off
She's cut from the finest cloth, my love
Plus, we like to take it easy
All she wants to do is please me
Every time I'm on that TV, calls me up, says


Take me away
Take me away
Take me away 

Take me away 

Take me away
Take me away


Wherever you go, just take me, take me, take me
Would you take me, baby
Take 
Want you take me away, take me away 
Take me away, take me away
If it's the last thing
Want you to take me away, take me away 
Take me away, take me away
Take me

Sittin' in the kitchen, a house in Macon
Loretta's singing on the radio
Smell of coffee, eggs, and bacon
Car wheels on a gravel road


Pull the curtains back and look outside
Somebody somewhere don't know
Come on now, child, we're gonna go for a ride
Car wheels on a gravel road


Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road


Can't find a damn thing in this place
Nothing's where I left it before
Set of keys and a dusty suitcase
Car wheels on a gravel road


There goes the screen door slamming shut
You better do what you're told
When I get back this room better be picked-up
Car wheels on a gravel road


Car wheels on a gravel road

Low hum of voices in the front seat
Stories nobody knows
Got folks in Jackson we're going to meet
Car wheels on a gravel road


Cotton fields stretching miles and miles
Hank's voice on the radio
The telephone poles, trees, and wires fly on by
Car wheels on a gravel road


Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road


Broken down shacks, engine parts
Could tell a lie but my heart would know
Listen to the dogs barkin' in the yard
Car wheels on a gravel road


Child in the backseat about four or five years
Lookin' out the window
Little bit of dirt mixed with tears
Car wheels on a gravel road

There'll be no payoff today
I'm just refusing to play
I'm gonna stand here and say
""C'mon, do your worst!""
Of course they'll never hear me
But we knew 'bout that from the first


I've had some lessons to learn
But they are not your concern
I think at least you'd admit
You get what you choose
'Cause I'm out here watching
Walking around in your shoes


No one is running for help
'Cause no one saves you from yourself
You've got solutions you need
Well, put on some speed


You never knew me at all
Now you tell me who's at fault
I left that book on the table
For you to read
But you've got to be willing
To pick up the language at least


And no one is running for help
'Cause no one saves you from yourself
You've got solutions you need
Well, put on some speed


There’s not a “they” who’s gonna stop it
That idea went with Adam, right after the fall

It all comes in view
I believe we came from the same cloud
Two drops in the ocean

From two rivers that delta to shore
Two drops in the ocean

Dissolve in the sea

The love we have
The only real thing

There is a stone wall around your heart
Nothing left now to do but to start
Chipping away, day by day
Until we see it break it apart

Let it be known, it can be done
Bit by bit and one by one
If the two of us try from both the two sides
Until we see the sun

Enter the game with a ill ass flow
For the love of my ancient ways of astral
Burnin' buds in the face of pain and back home

Metaphor for that inner spirit

She remain on all fours when my nigga hit it
Said she never met a star, but the sky's the limit

Keep a wife like ? when I spot them front row

Vacate like it's June, I escape too soon
Better cry a lake on a late afternoon
While I'm puffing high-grade
Elevate or we doomed

What is the reason if it beats you to your knees? What do you keep?

A painted serpent turning water into wine seeking light

You're living in your head but never feel their touch

Found a peace of mind in divine x2



My vision getting clearer
Made a change up in the mirror
Now your Mrs in attendance every time I make appearance, ooh!
Thought I thank my parents raising up to save a balance
Though I’m sipping on elixirs and I'm smoking on the chalice
Leaping over every challenge like a black panther
Every stanza got inside of spirit and then fuck a limit and go bananas
On this planet got to plan it, later its going to sprout its branches
Once you get it, take advantage, good intentions, no panic, no static
Found a peace of mind in divine, had to realize that the truth inside you and I
Saw my niggas die, way to many tears fall out my eyes
Always gotta strive, you could be the ribbon in the sky
Never knowing when it could be your day, shit cray
Pay attention to the omens, be the blessing in the grey
When you living in the moment you feel like a high don’t it
U-N-I-T-Y my nigga got 5 on it
Now my prophecy is golden, so a nigga keep it going
Yea my thrown I’m overthrowing, and my crown got thorns
Pop one for my niggas who winning without guns
God sun never stayed on my pivot i got funds
Got the chronic keep it rollin then we blow it out, blow it out
Celebrating we excel this is why we pour it out
Fuck you always worry about your semi semi tour bout
You could do this but you ain't creating up in your house
AK diminish the flow the realest spitters on the globe
Its from the coast so get a dose of comatose of holy smoke
Feeling sacred smoking flavors with ya bitches
Terminate that pussy babys on a nigga
Free at last in my LA pad keep on rolling fat
Hit a dab started from the bottom look at where we at
Broke the latch, now my generation taking all the cash, hey
Now my generations takin all the cash, show love



Everything happens for a reason my nigga
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Count your blessings and keep an open mind
Only you control your destiny my niggas

Asking if they wanna sign
But they don’t
And then they're like no no no
Will you just go, go, go

Picking up my friend from work
He’s really down and hurt
He has to move right in to my place
But he’s got my back but he’s not okay
I can see it in his face it’s bringing pain to me
But you’ve been hiding
Why are you lying?
Addictions seeping and it’s fucking kill me inside
To see people in my life who I love
Squeeze the soul out of you cause you were never enough
Now I’m sitting here high as I’ll ever be
Regretting all these memories
Wondering what this all meant to me

Dan dropped in about five o'clock
Pulled off his coat, said ""The night is short.""
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart

He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried.""

Well, Dan got happy and he started raving
He pulled out a razor, but he wasn't shaving
And all the cats knew to jump and hop
Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop

He hollered, ""Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone

The cops heard Dan when he started to shout
They all ran in to see what it was about
And I heard him holler as they led him away
He turned his head, and this is what he had to say

He hollered, ""Rave on children, I'm with ya!
Rave on, cats,"" he cried
""It's almost dawn and the cops are gone
Let's all get Dixie fried.""

Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw
He let us all know he wasn't scared of the law
And through the black crossed bars
He tossed a note to his dear
Said ""It ain't my fault, hon, that I'm in here.""

'Cause every time I close my eyes, all I see is you
I don't wanna dream about it

Bougainvilleas fall into the pool
The hard shelled bugs bite my forearm
My right index fingernail chewed to the quick
My cervix is alarmed, scared even
My sprinklers go off at 6 PM each day
And sometimes they spray unsuspecting visitors
My pimples are gooses all over my legs
My brow is furrowed and my vision is blurred


And how I do love London
And how I do love London


The birds make guttural sounds and protect me
My friends come to visit and love me a lot
I don't have the energy to fill them in
I am lagged by the jet and the 12 hour flight


And how I do love London
And how I do love London


I am intrigued by the boy with the androgynous songs
Sometimes they rhyme sometimes they rhyme not
The steam will smell of eucalyptus in the shower
The hug will feel forced upon you inconsolable thing


And how I do love London
And how I do love London


Deep breaths will not make my brain stand still
To be loved and swallowed or single and depraved
I love speaking French to the taxi drivers
We slept and were cold on the train out of France


And how I do love London
And how I do love London

Hot night tonight, I've got a fever in my bones
I don't know what it is that drives me so far away from home
But I've walked the white line til the time that I cannot stand no more
Then I take my boots off and I lay down on the floor


And if you find me by the roadside
Don't be afraid to call my name
And if I seem a bit uneasy
You know that I've only got myself to blame
You know that I've only got myself to blame


Walking down the road I want to fade into the night
I know I've seen a darker day but have I seen the light
All alone a country song that's burning in my head
I've turned my back on better days but tonight I'll stay in bed


And if you find me by the roadside
Don't be afraid to call my name
And if I seem a bit uneasy
You know that I've only got myself to blame
You know that I've only got myself to blame


Well I turn my head up to the sky and it's down the road I go
I'd tell you where I'm going but it's truly I don't know
And I don't look for no affection, I've always gone alone
When you see me coming home you'll know I'll soon be gone

Don't be afraid to call my name
And if I seem a bit uneasy
You know that I've only got myself to blame

Beautiful... Pain


Niggas studying shawty know what a hundred do
Actually the nigga backing me is right in front of you
Raising a daughter sometimes depending what her father do
Niggas stunt on you, front on you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead
By the time you get that
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but ain't good, so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap shit, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha, I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
Fuck you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um


Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga


Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
See what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes


Shamon.. hm-mmm
You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so now we syrup sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains
What can I say it got me highly motivated, mama two job working
But now the companies are merging
Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service
I'm too young to have burdens, but still feel I should be further
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it
The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered
It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up


You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
Sometime you don't gotta say much




Life is a game of inches
Every move leads to something better
There is no time to play the benches
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever

In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

In the book of love's own dream
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my lights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me

You
Flew
To me

In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me

Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said ""would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me? I'm feeling a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""


So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said ""when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead""
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair


I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened

One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is


That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah


I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is


That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah


We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive


And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is


That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

Another reason for a visit

Another nigga on the woodpile
Another honky on the dole
Another trip from off the 15th floor
The greatest story ever told was so wrong

Cause you promised milk and honey
With an everlasting life
And we listened with our ears closed
And a blindness in our eyes
But we heard them as they nailed you
And we saw you crucified

We need a pocketful of miracles
Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set

"True love is a rose
Behind glass
That's locked and kept closed
Maybe just to me
'Cause my heart's been attacked
And shattered by tough love
Bad love

So I bought mine off the street
True love, man, it just can't be beat
I felt so complete
Married to heavenly bodies above
And each night I'd look up
At a bright honey moon

'Cause it sure seemed built to last
And even after my honeymoon passed
I kept right with it, man
Like a ghost to a house it once haunted

And day after day
I'd steal with my true love away
To some hideout
We're left undisturbed
We could do what we wanted
But I started to feel like a liar
Saying I love you

She was madly in love or mad mean
There was no in between
It raised my alarm
I found I can't make a stand
I'm her hired hand
I have to do harm

One day I got sick
She played me a nasty old trick
Said, ""I need cigarettes""
Walked 'round the block
Caught a cab
Stayed gone for too long
My love had gotten so strong
Just to try being back on my own
I had to go to rehab

All I need is a safe place to bleed
Is this where it's at?
Half of no chance
Steps in a dance
Rest of my life spent in combat

Now I'm the king of the ward
'Cause I'm good and I swallow my sword
And puke it out for the doctor
To write me a new prescription
Tranquil as a dove
People that have lost their true love
They all seem to fit the same description

I feel cold, useless and old
I wish I was no one

Take me up, my Lord
Take me up today
Take me out of this place
Take me up with you today

No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe


Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I’m not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you’re looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more


But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe


Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There’s nothing in here moving
And anyway I’m not alone
You say you’re lookin' for someone
Who’ll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more


But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
Wasn't waiting on a prince to come riding into my life
Thought I was happy on my own
'Til you came and proved me wrong


I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love, yeah



Never pictured myself singing lullabies
Sittin' in a rocking chair in the middle of the night
In the quiet, in the dark
You're stealing every bit of my heart with your daddy's eyes
What a sweet surprise


And now I'm holdin' what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole

Hoping to come back around

To say that it's ok, but tell me

Behind someone else

Take back all of these times

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
But those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left


Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around


I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well, never mind
We are ugly, but we have the music.""


Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say

Tell my voice what it takes to speak up, speak up
And keep my conscience clean when I wake

You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out



Now there's an aching in my back;
A stabbing pain that says I lack
The common sense and confidence
To bring an end to promises
That I make in times of desperate conversation
Hoping my night could be better than theirs in the end
Just say when


Don't make this easy
I want you to mean it

You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out



I've never told a lie and that makes me a liar
I've never made a bet but we gamble with desire
I've never lit a match with intent to start a fire
But recently the flames are getting out of control

Call me a name, kill me with words
Forget about me, it's what I deserve
I was your chance to get out of this town
But I ditched the car and left you to-

Wait outside, I hope the air will serve to remind you
That my heart is as cold as the clouds of your breath
And my words are as timed as the beating in my chest

Once upon a time, not so long ago


Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day, working for her man
She brings home her pay for love, mmm, for love


She says, ""We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot""


Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer


Tommy's got his six-string in hock, now he's holding in
What he used to make it talk so tough, ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away when she cries in the night
Tommy whispers, ""Baby, it's okay, someday""


We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot""


Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer

You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

They have blown away the daylight hours we had
Left a legacy, a deadly aftermath
We cannot exist in godforsaken lands
As we spiral down into oblivion
Breathing the fumes of fires that they ignite
Losing ground and we are all just losing sight
We shall never see another setting sun
Time to rise up and ascend, the end has come
No more willpower choked by hell fire
Darkness above blackening out the sun
Gripped by steel claws corrosion eating us


So before we're all devoured
Time to rise up and retire
In cathedral spires
Watching as the world expires
From up amongst the clouds
In cathedral spires


No names, no graves
No prayers can save us
Ashes to dust, doomsday's upon us now
It cannot be stopped, genocide all is lost


Oh! We're so tired
Time to rise up and conspire
In cathedral spires
Watching as our world expires
From up above the clouds
In cathedral spires


Jaws of corruption swallow us as one
Consuming every nation
Evoke resistance getting none
Complete disintegration, no good to defend
There can be but one outcome
We are no more ascend
Vaporized fury offers no sanctuary


Oh! We're so tired
Time to rise up and retire

Watching as the world expires

Death is an open door

Burn a church and watch the flames, autumn embers turn to grey
Wooden crosses in decay, the flock of sheep now fucking slain

Say if women, and men would come to follow
To see what I might spend

Smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers, in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same

Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake


Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high


To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings...
La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...

Oh, Mike
Let's do it like we did in 1965
In that one little room, on the other side of the buildin'
We did Crosscut Saw

And it had a hell-uva groove to it

Funk-aay, but gettin' on down
Heavy stuff!

Watch this!

Oooo-wee!
Ooo-UH!

Do ya'all wanna go to the top one more time?

Do you want it from the top, one more time?

I told niggas I'm a hustler, it's like they keep on forgetting
36 mil in 8 months, you still think I'm bullshitting?

Went from selling crack to rap, that's two different games
But they're parallel to each other, homie, so they're quite the same
You know that crack spot so hot, you better off playing the block
Fiends can't help but be fiends, they come and cop for the cops
Back in the pens again, penitentiary doors spin
The game full of heartbreaks, can I win for Christ sakes?
Ace after ace, Lady Luck just won't fuck with me
That's why I got this attitude, nigga don't say what up to me
I took something heart-pumping, move and I'll pop something
Cop bricks, break 'em down to pieces and prop something
Niggas stay in stunt mode so I stay strapped up

I sip on Coke when it's with Henny, go for broke with the semi
Niggas talk behind my back, but they don't really want it with me
Pussy niggas pop shit, me I'm on that block shit
That rubber band, hundred grand in that night box, bitch
You know the raps bought the Benz, and the crack's bought the rims
Vivica she bought the gym, told ya I'm a fuckin' pimp
I was born a bad seed, I defied the odds
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I switched the cards
Still I keep a poker face, frontin' I'mma catch a case
Flip out, poke your face, you're laid out, now what a waste

"Ma non ci siamo già forse visti
Scusa credevo... mi sembrava...
Però hai un modo così strano
Di ondeggiare quel tuo bel sedere...
Dove vai... con quell'andatura...
In mezzo ai guai... così sicura?
Con quello spacco che quando s'apre
Mi sento ridere tutto dentro
Mentre consumo le mie idee
Tra il reggicalze e le tue mutande
Dove vai... con quell'andatura...
In mezzo ai guai... così sicura?

Tu stai camminando come se nel mondo
Tutto andasse bene... mentre sta scoppiando
Una terza guerra che farà sparire
Quei due bei seni che tu porti in giro

Perché ogni albero che buttan giù
Sarà segnato con il sangue tuo
E dai tuoi turgidi capezzoli sgorgheranno le città infette
Infette dalle bustarelle comunali
Come quella dei promessi sposi
E allora lasciati un po' andar...
Finché siamo ancora in tempo

Si così... i love you
Sento nelle vene
Scorrere come un fiume
La tua primavera

Che mi trasporta dove splende l'arte del rinascimento
Mentre vedo avanzar sulle acque del lago di Lecco
Un uomo con una vanga
Che comincia a scavare
E a seppellire
Tutti quanti i mangioni
Dell'anonima edilizia...
Che in nome del profitto
Hanno maciullato l'Italia
E raso al suolo Milano
E quel ramo di Lecco
Riducendolo come un colabrodo
Da Palermo a Como
E li vedo sprofondar...
Sprofondar giù nel buio
E l'uomo sai chi è?
Un certo Alexander
Che Manzoni fu
Quando si respirava

E la sua vendetta...
Nasce dai tuoi baci
Dal tuo candore...
Da questa tua sana sensualità
Che riscalda il sangue
E rinnova
Ciò che sta morendo

"Verse 1:
A red priest broke into our classroom
Caught us children by attention
""Listen closely to the words I speak
Lord knows if we’ll ever again meet”

Spoke such words never spoken before
On The Way he declared a war
Miracles like you’ve never seen
From a man who was raised up in the sea

A man is coming in thirteen-one
To charm the daughters and the sons
Scared for our lives, I turned to your hand
Hold this tight while we run, if we still can

Chorus:
What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age
It will land you and me
What tragedy may bring
Whatever may fall
The end of the world
You’ll still belong

Verse 2:
Before the red priest took his last breath
He told me, “Child, now don’t forget
The sun will turn dark very soon
Your days are numbered when there’s blood on the moon

""The earth will shake and the sky will fall
The eyes will open of those involved
Don’t take this son, but you’ll be killed
By the man from seven hills”

A man is coming in thirteen-one
To charm the daughters and the sons
Scared for our lives, I turned to your hand
Hold this tight while we run, if we still can

Chorus:
What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age
It will land you and me
What tragedy may bring
Whatever may fall
At the end of the world
You’ll still belong

Look children to the eastern sky
When you hear the voice say your last goodbyes
Look there to the eastern skies
When the ghosts take hold of the men who died
Look children to the eastern sky
When your fathers weep and your mothers cry
Look children to the eastern sky

What disasters may come
Whatever it may be
At the end of the age
It will land you and me
What tragedy may bring
Whatever may fall
At the end of the world
You’ll still belong

Look children to the eastern sky
When you hear the voice say your last goodbyes
Look there to the eastern skies
When the ghosts take hold of the men who died
Look children to the eastern sky
When your fathers weep and your mothers cry
Look children to the eastern sky

"Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who waste her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires
Sunrise has gone
Sunrise has gone

Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires

Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it isn't only madmen who listen to fools
""Is this the end?"" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm

Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun

Three thousand miles to sit in a room

Yo Ryan man 
I just sorted block girls 
I'm tryna talk to her but, we ain't even explain what happened 
It was funk, she was fine  
She was fine some of us scream for magazine 

Check this out man 


Trapped like a prisoner, fantasize of kissin' her
Treat you like a queen but other guys is dissin' ya
Thinkin' of ya nightly thigh so hold you tightly
Visualizin' figure, damn that excites me
I wonder if you know how much I think of you
If I can throw you water, then I sink in you
It's for eternity, this feelings are burnin' me
It's like a fire, this desire yearns to be pullin' me
Closer, until your chest is close to mine
Feelin' you heart beat, our arms are intertwined
Wantin' to kiss you, the passion raisin'
But don't wanna rush you, so I'm still waitin'
What if we were lovers, what a night that be
Cause we be raidin' undercover like the savage beast
Close my eyes and visualize, it's you I feel
Then wake up and realize, it was not real
It was just my heart, playin' tricks on me
Its tryna to make my fantasy a reality
Cause just thinkin' about ya baby, makes you want ya more
These feelings make me crazy but I can't ignore
What you mean to me, you're a dream to me
No matter how realistic it seems to be
Gotta get a grip on myself, because I'm dissin' myself
I wake up, I realize that I be kissin' myself
I just have to find this girl in my fantasy
And hope that someone in this world is who meant for me
But if I find her, will I have the nerve to speak?
Or will me ego overrob makin' my heart to greed?
I gotta do it, I gotta tell her how I feel
It's the only chance to make my fantasy turn real
Now my heart beats fast, I sweat feat on my thumb
Gotta get myself together cause here she come
I said: hi, she was fly, get lost in her eyes
Tried to speak another word but my tongue was tied
Damn, I can't explain it, the state I'm in
Every time I try to speak, I stutter again
Feel like I'm ready to cry, embarrassed outof  my mind
She smiles and gives me her number and says call her sometime
But she walks away, almost as quick as she came
And it hit me, I never even knew her name
So when I turned around, I felt my heart broke
She was gone, so was the number she wrote


It was a fantasy
Nothin' but a fantasy
I fell in love with a fantasy


Straight man 
Oh cuh 
But check this out man I just coming from the crib man, oh man
She's  I can't believe this man 
Let me tell you  is sayin'

Check this out


I woke up this Thursday mornin' in a terriful mood
Went straight to the kitchen cause I needed some food
Step inside, the kitchen door had tell me what I would see
A giant stackin' dirty dishes are waitin' for me
I didn't really wanna do it so I accepted the facts
Spill out all my funky tequila swisher and my feline hat
Sat in my yard, then I noticed it was nice outside
Tell my 
It was a fantasy
Nothin' but a fantasy
I fell in love with a fantasy


Damn, man. That's hard, man
Man, it was bugged out
Ain't that weird, though? We both felt like that?
Man, it was sort of a trip, man
I can never tell a homeboy this, man. Yo, keep this between me and you, man. Nobody ever gonna believe nothin' like this. Alright man, I'm straight goin' to school man
Just remember that shit, man

Late December, with my heart in my chest
And the clouds of my breath

Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through

'Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat

In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusion!


Soon the days were passing into years

Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word

Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears


So I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser

Talk to me, reveal how lost your life must seem
All the wonderful things that you could never achieve
Now you're out of time, your life is dry, you're wondering why
Remember how it used to be
You were young and love was cheap
And every night was fire and wine
Now you face another year
In a lonely state, in an empty place
Wiping dry your crying eyes
Wipe and dry your crying eyes
Talk to me, reveal how lost your life has been
All the wonderful things that you could never achieve
Now you're out of time, you're life is dry, you're wondering why
... I lost the rainbow
Behind that cloud, i lost the rainbow there
It's hard getting over all the rain
It's hard getting older all the same

Well, I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin' about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you, then I hope this does the trick


Cause I'm sick of your complainin' about how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin' 'bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife!


Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh!


So I called up my head shrinker, and I told him what I'd done
He said you'd best go on a diet, yeah I hope you have some fun
And a'don't go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
Cause you won't get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food


Now they're smokin' up the jail bonds, and then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit, but go real good with wine!


Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh!




Believe in all the good things that money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache from eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches, your inheritence won't last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend and shove it up your ass!


Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest!
Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; don't stop me now I'm going crazy

Ain't got a bag of blue funk, but a bag of green skunk
Want dogs? You want it? Muthafucka, knuckle up

Been through more growing pains than that nigga Michael Seaver
An over-achiever, you know you know my style
So peace to my niggas Danja Mo' and the Madchild
When I call a nigga out, he wants to wait  awhile like Janet
Niggas got jealous, they wanna ban it
But I still keep my voice, and when it's all said and done
Ayo, I still bring the noise
We wreck shop, so wait 'til the shit drop
Word is bond, yo, you know we don't stop
So niggas, press your luck, you get stuck like Chuck
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a damn
You know my name and you know who I am
The brother named 'Quence, all copped edition

Look out the left, the captain said
The lights down there, that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one
That you can wish upon
Not the northern one
That guides in the sailors


Oh, starbright, starbright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight


You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Now I can't talk to you, baby, I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
Up there's a heaven
Down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
Come on, light the candle in this poor heart of mine


Oh, starbright, starbright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around

Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out
Can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing ""Goodbye, baby
Baby, goodbye
Ooh ooh, love is blind""
Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on, baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again, baby

Love conquers all and someday it'll conquer you
There's nothing finer than falling all in it
When love is true
But once it goes out and breaks your heart
It still ain't history
When love dies it don't rest in peace
You can lock your doors and windows
To keep the pain at bay
Yesterday may be dead and gone
But the past won't go away
Its waiting right around every corner
With a heartache you don't need
When love dies it don't rest in peace


Oh when love dies
You can't bury those memories
Oh when love dies
It disappears but it never leaves
When love dies it don't rest in peace


How does love die then come back
A ghost rattling chains
It keeps on haunting my broken heart
Driving me insane
I hear it whisper my name in the night
Just like it still lives and breathes
When love dies it don't rest in peace

I've begun to realize
That I'm better when I am with you
You deliver me from the pain in my life
Easy now to recognize
All the misery I have been through
It was beating me to submission
'til the day you arrived


Certainly I felt alive
Strength I had lost was revived
An ending in sight and we both know why


'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine


Been betrayed too many times
Didn't think I would ever recover
They depart me for the rest of my life
Then you opened up my eyes
And you helped me rediscover
You're the one who resurrected
A man who had died


Your power, it gave me new life
You made me reborn and refined
Rebuilt from inside and we both know why


'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine


I never thought I would ever escape
At times I wanted to die
Feared that it all was just a little too late
Thought that I wouldn't survive
I let you in and let go of the hate
My heart recovered, now I
Owe you a debt that I could never repay
I still believe 'cause you're mine


I'm burning inside and we both know why


'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine


I can regain control because you're mine
I can take over the world because you're mine

"I got to know, Lord, when to pull back on the reins
Death can be the result of the most underrated pain
Satan whispers to ya, ""Well, I don't want to bore ya
But when ya get tired of the Miss So-and-so I got another woman for ya.""
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
When the deeds that you do don't add up to zero
It's what's inside that counts, ask any war hero
You think you can hide but you're never alone
Ask Lot what he thought when his wife turned to stone
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
Here comes Satan, prince of the power of the air
He's gonna make you a law unto yourself, gonna build a bird's nest in your hair
He's gonna deaden your conscience 'til you worship the work of your own hands
You'll be serving strangers in a strange, forsaken land
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
Well, your true love has caught you where you don't belong
You say, ""Baby, everybody's doing it so I guess it can't be wrong.""
The truth is far from you, so you know you got to lie
Then you're all the time defending what you can never justify
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
So many of my brothers, they still want to be the boss
They can't relate to the Lord's kingdom, they can't relate to the cross
They self-inflict punishment on their own broken lives
Put their faith in their possessions, in their jobs or their wives
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
When my life is over, it'll be like a puff of smoke
How long must I suffer, Lord, how long must I be provoked?
Satan will give you a little taste, then he'll move in with rapid speed
Lord keep my blind side covered and see that I don't bleed

I hate myself for loving’ you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell


I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin


Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’till he’s tame
All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame


There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them
In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet
I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at least I’m out of debt


Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me
’Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other’s eyes ’till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?


So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at
I hate myself for loving’ you, but I should get over that

We catch amnesia for fun

"I have made you in my likeness
And I make you the keepers of my garden world
And if you honor me in kind, I will be grateful, but be warned
For I'm an angry, jealous God
Who placed the demons in hell
And the angels in heaven
At my side
Set me free, I'll grant your hearts desire
And I will share the secrets of the grand design
Give me daughters, send me sons I'll make them all chosen ones
I will send them out to die
To meet the angels of death
With no tears or regrets
I was cast down from the heights
My blood must pay for the debt
That was made when they left
Because of me
And if they taste the blood we'll let them drink
And if they taste the flesh we'll let them eat
And if one has to be forgiven the we'll pardon all of them
And if they raze our walls we'll let them in
And if they raise their swords we'll let them hit
And if one has to be forgiven the We'll pardon all of them
Let me lead you to the garden world
I will place you at the right of my father's hand
While I was tempted in the wild
I crossed from start til end of time
And I emerged the lamb
Who's blood must pay for the debt
That was made when they left
As I ascend into the sky
I'll free the angel from hell
And place them in heaven
At my side

I know I've seen your face somewhere
Selling something, some big idea
I know I've seen that vacant stare
Selling sunsets for somebody else


You find yourself asking yourself
What is any of it worth
You find yourself looking up at night
From the bottom of the earth


And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore?
And oh, did your sheep start jumping?
They grow out their teeth
Did they need a little something more than this?


The taste of trouble on your lips
'Cause now they're biting at your thoughts
You tell yourself just to turn away
But you know you've already lost


The smell of rain when it’s on a wind
Will never be paid in full
You try in vain to account for this mess
And everything that you stole


Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? 
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? 
They grow out their teeth
Did they need a little something more than this?


'Cause now they're biting at your feet
They got you running from this place
Now they're breathing down your neck
Your eyes look lonely in your face


I see you looking just out of frame
What is it pulling you there?
'Cause things can never stay the same
So what is keeping you here?


Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? 
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? 
They grow out their teeth
They need a little something now

Every time you think, well, they’d be biting at your thoughts
And every time you blink, well, you'll be so damn far
But you want more than this
I know I've seen your face somewhere

I can't help it if that dog-gone moon above

The wall on which the prophets wrote
Is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death
The sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart
With nightmares and with dreams
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
When silence drowns the screams?


Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying


Between the iron gates of fate
The seeds of time were sown
And watered by the deeds of those
Who know and who are known;
Knowledge is a deadly friend
If no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see
Is in the hands of fools

Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs
At all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!


Do you wanna be in the business? 
The ups and downs with the hoes 
Always getting fronted on at shows 
People gotta stick their nose 


Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the gains just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real


They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say ""Where's my loot?""
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cause you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, ""More soup with your meal?""
Cause this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...


Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cause they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cause your lyrics is butt


Do you wanna be in the business? 
People can't walk a straight line in 
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in 
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine 


The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
""Oh, he's a cutie"", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs, I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game and I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham


Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing 
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
 That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild

It's propaganda


Don't tell me how to keep my composure
It ain't over till I get me some closure
Wanted dead or alive is my profile
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace
Severely a mental disorder
Where reality is highly distorted
Psychosis - weaken the mind
Incline to small doses as we approach this
Ever endless quest for a vengeance
While those who expose and pretend this
Life is just a big bowl of cherries
A bunch of fairies screaming to be scary


It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again

You better come packing more than a scandal
Fucked over for the times I've been grateful
Fucked over led to times I've been hateful

Cum again, friend, now we got some action
On and on is the name that they gave me
And your misery came here to save me

I do my shootings on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin' he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
Got me bailin' to stash more green guys
Ain't tryin' to be trapped on no block
Slangin' them rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin'
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
God's words or a curse like crack?
Shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus' traps


Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayers, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
'Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this bottomless pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus


All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail

Bodybag you punk pickups when these niggas go put they shit up

They thinkin' that it's funny to kill for real
Plus gettin' twenty 20 bills, twenty minutes makin' money still
Patrollers be rollin' tryna hold us and haunt us
All swooped up and on us, 'cause we groupin' up on corners

I'm shootin', startin' a revolution with my kids
My cell block, whatever, held rock but never
Too close to the sword, he got jail dropped forever, Black Jesus


To this clique I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggas pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggas play together
We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wish is niggas smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
I'll mob on, while they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hate the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast 'til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine, trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin' Black Jesus

Some say, one day
Some day, some how
Some way we gon' fail
Either six ditches or twelve
Just stick us and leave us in jail
Oh well, I bail, blazed out drunk as hell
Waitin' to fade, 'cause Black Jesus see
Just how this world treat His seeds, His young
Beat us 'til we dumb for fun, why run
When the outcome don’t do me justice in the long run
So I say, ""Fuck this whole world, bitch,"" breathless
Time is tickin', our minds clickin', 'til we blackout
Goin' all out, overboard route for clout
And Black Jesus come and save our seeds 'cause we need you
All play by the same to see us, Black Jesus

And it makes you wonder
Why we're here at all

But you can't do jack so shut up and dance!

Even though you mad at me, you'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning, baby, life is good
Me and you against the whole hood – soon as I get home


Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Soon as I get home
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I come home


Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin' in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures, beggin' for some sexin'
Stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is ""Keep it real or you can die squeelin'.""
Plus, I never had to worry 'bout a visit, ‘cause you're there daily
Guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me
Tongue-kissin', steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'
Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'
Late night reminiscin', everybody's quiet
I think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring
I started a war but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the mornin', it's on soon as I get home


Grab my gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Let's get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home


Since you've been gone
My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low
Thinkin' big, like the kid from Casino
Fulfillin' my dreams like Nino
Brown, the whole town be shook up
And me and Mama survivin'
Depends on how many rocks a young nigga cook up
Narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted
Wantin' me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
Yeah, nigga, I heard, Lil' Mu gave the word
You get paroled on the third, it's all love with these herbs
We out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
But double O's is what I'm wantin'
And I'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
Luxury life, results livin' bad
Tricks of the trade, shit that shoulda been taught by Dad
But learned through the crew
Lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I stay waitin' by the phone
Hopin' I'll get a call tellin' a nigga that you home


Grab the gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home

I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging?; what did you bury?
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?


I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do


I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know


So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do


I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do

I don't know what to do with myself
Friday night, there's a handle on the shelf
I could use a hand, I could use some help
Lord, knows I've been going through hell
Might step outside, catch a breath of fresh air
Or I might just drop to the middle of nowhere
Do a little soul-searching, little moonlight churching


'Cause my world's gone numb and I just wanna feel something
Running low on hope and I don't know if I can overcome it


I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long
They say the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
How life goes on


Used to be on a Friday night
Baby, you and me be under neon lights
Smell the smoke all over our clothes
We hang around till the whole town closed
Now every bar I pass makes my heart head South
Every drink I have leaves a bad taste in my mouth
And baby that's why


I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long
They say the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on

Come on!

A young nigga who didn't gain from fame
Copped a range rov'

Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold
Get money like Ross Perrault

Oh thats the road you on, oh no
Im down for the rifle tone of faux faux

Show me that your loco, put hoes in my photo, NOPE!

Stayin in im just gettin much older
Its time to go start puffin up trees

They take my life away?

You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
Those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah but you got away, didn't you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well never mind
We are ugly but we have the music.""

And then you got away, didn't you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you

Always stacking and I'm paid, that's ASAP

Slow that down, Screw, Watts or Ron C
I'm getting rap money but I used to run D
MC, rep, run it
Frank Cyser shit, any beat get punished
Y'all got problems, I get money
So my neck, fist, wrist always look sunny
I stay fresh, y'all niggas look bummy
Cold with the flow, so I ball like Tommy

Thick like Serena, my pockets on Venus, nigga!

This is how it all begins
Move your feet
Feel how sweet it is
Dream on little dreamer

You gotta gather up what you need
You gotta choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You gotta go
You gotta keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
You know you got to go
Keep on little dreamer
Keep hold of all that you are
Move your feet
Feel how sweet it is

"My feet plow on
From light to dawn
My empty belly and my body aches
Ain't hard to take
Next to the weight I carry in my chest
A pound of flesh
Could never tip the scale that I've made
I should have stayed
But I was never wise

I hear your voices in the wind
That cuts the night
And I pray to whatever is listening
Things'll be alright

Oh my boy you're alive
Your heart's still beating
So don't you mind
Don't you mind
We all drift sometimes

I can still hear your feet
As you ran from the house
Knowing you won't be back
Doesn't mean that I will stop waiting
You told me then:
""Hold me down, hold me up to the fire
But don't you dare hold me back!""

I see your faces in the clouds
That scar the night
And I pray to whoever is listening
Things'll be alright

Then today I wake up feeling easy
And find I'm on a more familiar road
I got a darkness wrapped inside me
But now it ain't so hard to let it go
So leave your candle burning in the window
I'm almost home

Speak until the dust
Settles in the same specific place
Light refused to go
Drink it from a cast and iron plate
Instead of cold milk
Was offered unripe
Instead of silence
Considered craven
Nothing made it seem
Hidden where the aging soil was pure
Pressed against the crease
Mountains become fragrant at the source
So can you stand this
Exotic angle
I read it somewhere
That they would lie still


I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love


Un-relied I was called
Missing teeth out of favor
Nickel beach it was all
Gathering by the sundial
I woke hard
I woke heavy
For the half way stop
Five whole hours in
When I woke hard
I woke heavy with the live or parts

Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form

Just when all the bills are due
And the fields they're under lock and key
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this

And they're handing down my sentence now
And I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you

There are many in your life
And many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
But I have to deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you

Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right

Eighty an hour and the radio loud
The same songs with the same old rhymes
Tell me to shake it off and swing from the lights


But I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned

Funny how easy you could see my blindside
Still the same songs with the same old beats
Sure, I could stay, but there’s a place I’d rather be

And you ripped us apart
How could you?

But now it's breaking my heart

Tears run down as I think of the days we've had
And the memories will last forever
But you and I will die
And go our separate ways

Going your own way, go

On the path of progress
To gain new insight
Lose control
Give in to your senses
To reach brand new heights

When a grandeur of scenes arrives with the night
Revealing the author of fear
The reason why all of my virtues are shut down and hollow
If the light that sinks in is changing all shapes
And magic brought down to its knees
I will not be the one to lose it all over again

We will take you the mire
We will show you shattered rhymes

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted
Unlock the hidden heart inside
See the wonder of my world with true transparent eyes

A silhouette without a face
Imprinting a vision that opens my eyes to creation
Its identity will reflect what I see

And lift up the shadows that keep me from reaching the bay

Shadows bring the night to life
Anguish harbors depth of fright

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted

See the wonder of my world with true transparent eyes

You alone welcome the other side

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted

Deep within the forlorn stream
Lies the wonder of my world in a true transparent dream

Jesus Christ, girl
I laid up for hours in a daze
Retracing the expanse of your American back
With Adderall and weed in my veins
You came, I think?
Because the marble made my cheeks look pink
But I'm unsure of so many things

You're holding me
I close my eyes
You're whispering
And I start to cry

You feel so good
So beautiful
For as long as you live
Don't let me go

Just hold me
Touch me
Feel me
As long as you love me

Reach for me
And need me
If you could trust me
And teach me

Never let go of me
Because you're half of me
My heart still beats
Looking in the eyes

The eyes of love
I hold your face
And I see the sun
And I taste your kiss

You touch my soul
I'm feeling things
I've never felt before
Just hold me

Touch me
Feel me
As long as you love me
Reach for me

And need me
If you could trust me
And teach me
Never let go of me

Because you're half for me
My heart still beats

I am feeling
What they call pure love
I never know
Feelings like this

Could exist
Inside of me
I'm soaring
Emotions exploding

I don't want to live
Another day if you're
Not here with me
Just hold me

Touch me
Feel me
As long as you love me
Reach for me

And need me
If you could trust me
And teach me
Never let go of me

Because you're half of me
My heart still beats
Because you're half of me

My heart still beats
My heart still beats

Every Saturday night, I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care

But I don't want to be nowhere but here

Running hand in hand
Needing no where to stay
Driven to the mountains high

Back where there's nowhere to stay
When fire filled the sky
I'll still remember that day
These rocks I'm climbing down
Have already left the ground
Careening through space

Humming along to some old Haggard song
You ought to see her when she’s on


Down at the office in those high heels
Looking like a million, closing big deals
She’ll remind the boys, eyes are way up here
Yeah that’ll make you smile ear to ear


You ought to see her when she’s on
That leather couch, reading that fairy tale
To a sleepy-eyed little girl in pajamas and ponytails
Saying one day your prince charming will come along
You ought to see her when she’s on


Oh, you ought to see her when she’s on
That front porch in those old cut-off jeans
And that Texas Longhorns t-shirt, smiling back at me
When you see her dressed to kill
And it drops your jaw


You ought to see her when she’s
On that leather couch reading that fairy tale
That’s when she’s on
That’s when she’s on that front porch
In those old cut-off jeans
That’s when she’s on
Oh, when she’s on
That’s when she’s on

Time held its breath
A motionless spell of rapture
Across the room
A memory had been captured

And through the years
Though distance lay between us
I carried your torch
To illuminate the darkness


And I still lose myself
In that orange glowing moment
When your upturned face
Seemed to answer all my questions

But when I asked myself
As I do from time to time now
Where it all went wrong
Is there really any point in making plans?

In making plans?


So I made my vows
In the last low hours of morning
As I lay you down
I heard you whispering a warning


But then we lost ourselves
In that orange glowing moment
And your upturned face
Seemed to answer all my questions

But when I asked myself
As I do from time to time now
Where it all went wrong
Is there really any point in making plans?

We goin' all out, we goin' all out
We goin' all out
Watch your motherfuckin' mouth, niggas!

Do it, do it, do it!


Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk ‘cause I'm a mad man whenever sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, Your Honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit, heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me, another gay rapper
Bustin' caps at Jay Z and still avoid capture 
While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
I'm in Jamaica sippin' daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin' then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
Niggas player-hatin', got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin' ""Death Row!"", throw my Westside, ain't no thing
We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang
We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this: I'm hard to kill when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the Hell did I survive these five shots?
Live it up or give it up and like demons
Late night, hear them screamin', ""We goin' all out!""


We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out


I'm on my last leg, walkin' through the belly of the beast
Feelin' like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mob niggas hidin' in bushes
Claimin' that they ride rough, but they softer than cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin' in blood
Outlawz, my blood brothers, I'd die for these thugs
Say hi to this slug
It's a shame how some niggas on the West Coast
Was ridin' with 'Pac, but when he died they went pop
I'm out in Jers, to the fullest, like some West Coast love
But after 'Pac stopped rappin', it ain't no West Coast thug
Just West Coast, slut, to my real niggas stuck in the street game
‘Cause rappers like Jay Z be pumpin' Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin'? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo'-fo' put peek holes through your door
I ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin' this
It's all from my heart when I was writin' this; all out!


We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out


Now, we all ride, and down to die — who with us?
Speak up or get treated like you comin' to kill us
They ain’t nothin' but squealers
In this rap game, swearin' they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin' they 'Pac
Stop that, and watch your back, we ain't forgot 'bout ya
These Glocks hot, and when shot it'll bring the bitch up out ya
It's me, Kastro with the goattee, walkin' like a OG
‘Cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to thug lords like them motherfuckers holy
Frontline soldier, 'til the Heavens call me
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' 'bout, ‘cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'til they feel it
Livin' proof, Pac breed niggas they can't deal with
Holla back, right back, and watch your mouth
Or get blood in it, what! We goin' all out, nigga!


We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out


Fool, you better go all out
Keep goin' all out
All my niggas goin' all out
Without a muthafuckin' doubt
Aye, you niggas just gon' think you gon' be uhh
Talkin' slick on all of these motherfuckin' records
And we ain't gon say shit

Don't disrespect the Don
It's still war, motherfuckers

"Di piu belle al mondo non ce n'è
Pensavo quel famoso giorno all' altar
Eri meglio forse anche più di lei
Più di lei che ora amo da morir
Come un sogno sei stata per me ...

Mi ricordo quando tornavo a casa
Stavi alla finestra ad aspettar
Invece quando ora torno da te
Tu non m'aspetti piuù, e a volte in casa non ci sei...

E se di notte tardavo forse non ricordi più
Sotto le coperte tu , m'aspettavi
Ed eri , con neanche la sottoveste
Bruciava la tua pelle nuda ,dalla voglia
Di stringermi,di stringermi
Adesso quando vieni a letto come ti vesti
E ti spogli quando ti alzi da me
E per paura che di far l'amore io ti chieda
Ne inventi sempre una ogni sera
Ma forse vuoi farti pregare da me...

I tuoi baci da tempo me li hai fatti sospirar
Forse tu l'hai fatto solo
Per legarmi a te
E invece, hai sciolto questo nodo
Che lui dall'alto aveva fatto per noi due
E non vedevi, che ero solo...
Ora tu piangi perchè io amo un'altra
Oh Signore, giacchè non vuoi che lasci,la donna
Che tu hai scelto per me, e che quel giorno
Portai all'altar, ti prego aiutami cancella
L'altra dal mio cuor, perchè la sposa che hai
Dato a me, e solo una sorella ormai
Chi lo sa se tornero ad amare lei...

They got me paranoid all these different faces
I know somebody the police I can fucking taste it
Mmm mmm mmm, I can smell a rat
Fire, fire, fire, let them feel the gat

Nigga four Os nigga throw like a quarterback


Small things to a giant, its too easy
Just got dressed I'm colder than the flu season
Its too easy its too easy
Its too easy its too easy


I do this in my sleep I need to change the covers
Menage a trois and I dont change the rubbers
Nasty nigga so dont ask a nigga
Black and ashy flashy with charisma
A pack of cigarillos and 2 liter
And that's just for two people
Trynna get numb nigga cuz my feelings hurt
Dealing work I'm a go to jail I keep killing verses
I got a hard top I'm about to convert
Bought her ass a bag and paid they phone service
Name brand head to toe walking in strokers
Two girls on my coat walking out of strokers
Its a small thing the big foot
That's why I stalk my money taller, the six foot
And I'm motivated to get more of it
Rich nigga getting private dances in public




I say its too easy me and two Breezys
Everything around me sick, flu season
Got the minis popping pack doing them calisthenics
Pack of bitches trynna make a movie for the final edit
Shouts out to my bad bitch that red ho with them tattoos
That fat ass and them green eyes got green guys my trap boom
Got work to sell got pounds of kush
Break it down got ning dings
Got nine hoes need nine mo, roster Bruce Springsteen
That mac 11 start talking fast
That paper stacking like Kinkos
Blowing strong popping bands
These niggas stealing our lingo
And I'm TRUed up got two cups
Me and 2 Chainz go too nuts
Two guns and I'm deuced up
22s and I'm couped up
Low pro crew cut
She fuck with me then my crew fuck
Chicken noodle she souped up
And I'm layed back with my boots up

Now Im out of town brought mami there
Then me go call said bring that all

Please remember what I'm going through

And I want to be there with you

Before the world we knew was torn apart
Now when I close my eyes I can be with you
But are we really dancing in the dark

Her right hand closed the front porch door
Suddenly a child no more
All the ribbons all the bows in a box now on her closet floor
Anxious for whats to come
Afraid to leave a place she loves


She's not a woman, not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover, make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17


Broken hearts and rusted dreams
Sometimes make it hard to leave and
Certainty is out of reach even with some self belief
So she bites her lip and shows a smile
Flips her hair and flaunts her style


She's not a woman, not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover, make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17


Her memories she stowed away
Pulls them out on rainy days
And brand new faces take their place beside the ones that never fade
She's strong and fragile, weak and smart
Whatever the cost she plays the part


She's not a woman, not a girl

Come on!


I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore

A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back


It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me


I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes


I hit you and you hit me back
And we fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real

Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back


It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes


 I won’t let you control my fate
While I’m holding the weight of the world on my conscience
 I won’t just sit here and wait
While you're weighing your options, you’re making a fool of me

 You didn’t dare try to say that you don’t care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
 It ain’t like me to beg on my knees
""Oh please, oh baby, please"", that’s not how I’m doing things

 No, I’m not upset, no, I’m not angry
I know love is love, love and sometimes it pains me
 With or without you, I’ll always be with you
You’ll never forget me, I’m keeping you with me

 No, I won’t let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
 No, I’m not your puppet
And, no, no, no, I won’t let you go


No, no matter how far we’ve come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow


With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

Nigga you don't know me, and I don't know you
You think you know my crew 


I been a problem since the old days, pimps and gold caps
Now I'm in O.J. Simpson throwbacks
Y'all was wonderin where my ass been
Probably vacationin on South Beach gettin head like an aspirin
If you gassed, I can let the tec pound your ego
Or lock you in a closet with the West Nile mosquito
The press crowd in people, especially celebrities
I'm heavily shittin on any Tom Dick or Gregory
Nigga you better be strappin; they want you dead if you rappin
I'm tryin to cave your head and your back in
I'm gettin bread and relaxin, and attractin a fan base
Of females with e-mails and letters to fax in
In Vegas with a toaster and a blunt
And the hotel I'm checked in, got a rollercoaster in the front
I'mma post 'em when I stunt, the Sammy Sosa of the month
Better yet the whole season, nigga I'm still breathin
Even though my dollars are green
I rap for the kids that's too poor to waste eggs on Halloween
I'm gettin swallowed clean, my habits are good
Collectin all the karats I could
Slidin from a stash spot to conceal the torture
And a good silencer to make it sound like the Wheel of Fortune
All this careless talkin, cause I'm travelin and flossin
Havin a good time, and you havin a abortion
You sucker for love, gettin married and divorced then
Can't even afford the batteries for your Walkman
I'm out the hood, burnin Cali weed on Slausson

Since 50 hooked up with Shady, now they tryin to book up and pay me
If you think I'm shook up you crazy, baby

Smokin out a bag big enough to fit on vacuum cleaners
I wore a glove when I blazed you fatty, I ain't your baby daddy
She flippin, now he tryin to grab me out the navy Caddy
I ain't your ave-y, papa was a rolling stone
Stockin up to own a home, pocket full of loaded chrome
Drop and get a hold of dome, I know your motive homes
You mad, cause I'm fuckin half your Motorola phone
I'm swift with the women I'm good with my words
A lot of, niggas is hatin on what I deserve I'm hotter
Front if you want, end up on the curb in your Prada
And your mans runnin, ambulance comin
Another day another dollar, on the low from the Impala

I spent my time watchin'
The spaces that have grown between us
And I cut my mind on second best
Or the scars that come with the greenness

And I gave my eyes to the bottom
Still the seabed wouldn't let me in
And I tried my best
To embrace the darkness in which I swim


I'm walkin' back down this mountain
With the strength of a turnin' tide
Oh the wind's so soft and my skin
And the sun so hard upon my side

Oh lookin' out at this happiness
I search for between the sheets
Oh, feelin' blind and realize
All I was searchin' for was me

Oh, oh-oh, all I was searchin' for was me...


Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin'

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong


I saw a friend of mine the other day
And he told me that my eyes were gleamin'
Oh, I said I had been away
And he knew, oh, he knew the depths I was meanin'

And it felt so good to see his face
All the comfort invested in my soul
Oh, to feel the warmth of a smile
When he said, ""I'm happy to have you home

Oh, oh-oh, I'm happy to have you home""


Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin'

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong


'Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh, eyes like wild flowers, oh, with your demons of change...



May you find happiness there 

May all your hopes all turn out right 


Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no 
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long 
Oh my, my darlin'

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong

O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed


Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!




When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors and then rapidly
Just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me


I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest


I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand

I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head



Step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone

Sick of you acting like I owe you this

When I was younger
My daddy told me I would never
Never amount to nothing special
He'd come at me from every angle
He'd say
""You're the last thing I wanted, the last thing I need
How am I gonna answer when my friends tell me
My son was kissing boys in the street?""


He tried to change me
Said I'm embarrassing my country
How could I do this to my family?
Do I wanna grow up being lonely?
He'd say
""We've worked for our money, we put you in school
Is this how you repay us? Do you think this is cool?
My son, stop kissing boys in the street
My son, stop kissing boys in the street""




Now that I'm older
My daddy's heart's a little warmer
But he still won't hug me like my brother
And he still won't kiss me like my mother

""You're a part of this family, I made you myself
But the way that you act isn't good for your health
My son, stop kissing boys in the street
My son, stop kissing boys in the street""




My daddy's dying
And he's finally realized I'm not lying
We sit in silence but we're smiling
Because for once we are not fighting
He said
""There was no way of knowing 'cause all I was taught
Is men only love women, but now I'm not sure
My son, keep kissing boys in the street
My son, keep kissing boys in the street
When I'm gone, keep kissing boys in the street""

When she call ya, ask that tramp whassup
And if she hesitate, nigga hang up, worrrd up
And let that bitch meditate to the dial tone
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfuckin' mack tonight
Stay that stay strapped cause my raps is tight
You fuckin' punks, I hate you snitches
Went against the grain and the game to be fake ass bitches


Punk motherfuckin' ass
Fuck that punk ass nigga he ain't about shiiit
Trick ass motherfucker

Kiss my motherfuckin' ass

Break 'em off somethin'
I can't stand fake ass bitches
Lyin' ass niggas and you punk ass snitches
Break 'em off somethin'


Time to show these bustas who's boss
Run up on a real motherfucker and get tossed
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin' jimmy
Broke hoes runnin' round yellin' ""Gimme!""
I can't stand it, hoes talkin' bout they got a man
Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK
So how about hittin' a motherfucker on my pager
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later
Fly how I fade her, played her like a game of Sega
Fuckin' with the player that done made her, huh
And I ain't sleepin' caught you creepin' for my money
Got the dick and now you get the pistol honey 
She get the bozack, knockin' hoes back, keep my dough stacked
So where the motherfuckin' hoes at?
Punk niggas can't fade the mack, livin' fat
Gettin' paid to rap, it's like that, you motherfuckin' bitches


Fuck that nigga he ain't about shit

Do the shit, fuck em all


Break em off somethin'
I can't stand fake ass bitches

I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin' ""Fuck the world"" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin' 'til I earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
It's the good life - maybe niggas got it goin' on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life


This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust the hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
See, we live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die


No one knows what the, future holds, for you
Haha, listen closely
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin' down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
Why I should change, into a softie
.. after livin' so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggas, and my girl - livin' the good life!


We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
Uh ha, We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die


I spend my days and nights not knowin' if, strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin' way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin' big ceilin'
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
But we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin'
Bitch nigga get to runnin' 'fore my click get to gunnin'
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
We still tryin' to get a hold of the game
Livin' that good life


We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uhh
We live the good life, fuck my foes

Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't, uhh
We live the good life, fuck my foes

As I holler ""where y'at?""

Then I look into the mirror, noticed shattered glass
Looking like a spider web caused by a blast

Not so easy to forgive; harder to forget
Take what you want




I'm impossible to figure out
So impossible, you had your doubts


Take what you want from me
It means nothing now
Take everything, honey
It means nothing now
Not so easy to forgive; harder to forget

Take what you want from me

Not so easy to forgive; harder to forget

Please don't bury me alive
Cause it's kilin me inside

Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note ""I'll be back in 5""
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey


I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do


But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved


I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey


I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do


But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush

Smoke a sack, smoke a sack, take that dope straight to your head
Smoke a sack, smoke a sack, it's G*59 until I'm dead

One ten year old was found after three weeks
In a snowdrift ten feet from his door
Some fell asleep in their cars and awakened no more


Twenty-five people died shoveling snow
Have that done by somebody you hate
One-hundred-sixty-six looters arrested, but wait


I spent the blizzard of '78
On a commune in Northern Vermont
With all the Isaac Asimov anybody could want


Music was very much not allowed
So we said ""Hey kids, let's start a band""
Proof that Ganesh loves us
There was no tape deck at hand


The first band I'd had was called ""One and a Half""
We were a duo, technically
So if Tonto's Expanding Head Band was a band
So were we


I spent the blizzard of '78
On a commune in Northern Vermont
With all the Ursula Le Guin anybody could want


I played guitar, Chris played tin cans
Caroline played tambourine
Chris was 11, Caroline 12, I 13


We called ourselves ""the Black Widows""
We weren't the last nor the first
But we were almost certainly by far the worst


We made the Cramps sound orchestral
That's an achievement, I guess
As for rehearsal
We made the Shaggs sound like Yes

I was dreaming we were running
From a city burning
Down, down, down
Made a break, a new escape
And let the world crash
Down, down, down

Now there's a piece of me
Tells me I shouldn't leave
Everytime I see your face

Because everytime
You come around
Love, you take my breath away


And I just wanna breathe until
I take you in
I never want you to leave until
I take you in



She has no idea

That I'm even here

She has no idea

That I'm even here



Get a grip
Slip and trip
Over clumsy careless
Words, words, words
Paper thin fingerprints
Under softly spoken
Verse, verse, verse
Now there's so much of me
Telling me not to leave
Everytime I see your face

Because everytime
You come around



And I just wanna breathe until
I take you in
I never want you to leave until
I take you in



She has no idea

That I'm even here

That I'm even here



She's so close when I'm so far away
When I'm so far away
Let me dream, let me stay
She's so close when I'm so far away
When I'm so far away
I can sleep, I can dream, I can change
She has no idea
But I'm so far away 
She has no idea
Now I'm so far away

I wish I were in Dublin or some other seaport town
I'd set my foot on a steamboat and sail the ocean 'round
Sailing 'round the ocean, sailing 'round the sea
I think of handsome Molly wherever she may be
I am a beggar-man and a begging I have been
For three score or more on this little isle of green
I'm known from the Liffy on down to Segu
And I'm known by the name of Little Johnny Doo
Of all the trades a-going sure a-begging is the best
When a man gets tired he can lay his head to rest
He can beg for his supper when there's nothing else to do
Or go sit 'round the corner in his old rigadoo
We slept one night in a barn in Clairebon
We went naked all night and slept until the dawn
Holes in the roof and the rain a-pouring through
And the cats and the rats they were a-playing peek-a-boo
Who should awaken but the woman of the house
In a white spotted apron and a calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""Boo!""
""Don't be afraid ma'am, it's only Johnny Doo!""
Over the fields with a pack on my back
Over the hills with a creak in me sack
Holes in my shoes and my toes peeking through
Singing ""Shinkle and a wrinkle it's only Johnny Doo!""
Well, it's getting late at night and it's time to go to bed
And the fire's all out and whoops goes the light
Now you know the story of the old rigadoo
So good night and God be with you says Little Johnny Doo

Steeped in denial, oh the daily grind
Dream of a world for me and my kind
So stick your standards where the sun doesn't shine

Or take their guilt trip at the end of the line

All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay I don't feel safe, I don't feel safe


Left broken, empty and in despair
Wanna breathe, can't find air
Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
So much more I have to say
Help me find a way


And I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone


I tell you, all my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe
I need to pray


Why do you play me like a game?
Always someone else to blame
Careless, helpless little man
Someday I might understand
There's not much more to say
But I hope you find a way


Still, I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone

Oh, save me

God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us

Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep, and you won't come back from the nap

As soon as I leave the house you want to page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe It makes me want to leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know

Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
You fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean  and love hurts 
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time


Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing  paper 
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time


You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine

Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year


And I would like to know:
How do you feel?
How do you feel? Oh
How do you feel?
How do you feel? Oh

Paaaaaa pa-pap paaaaaaa
Pa-pa paaaa pa-pa pap pa paaaaa

Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of 95
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man?


Just you let me know:
How do you feel?
How do you feel? Oh
How do you feel?
How do you feel? Oh

Some friends turn foes over money and hoes
When they family ain't tight, when they money ain't right
When you party with me, you party all night
Cause I ain't with doing nothing if we ain't doing it right
Players hate us when they getting face-to-face altercations
They be getting played like Sony Playstation
When the feds having fun, cockblockers try to stop me
I heard some cats be in the background trying to clap me
I see them when they start scheming, I know what they thinking of
Mad at us for being players and they can't get no love
What it boil down to, cause my flow's hot, your flow's not
You're so-so going against 50 Cent, that's a no-no
Y'all know better than that


Flowers blooming, morning dew, and the cats just ain't the same
It's a pleasure when you treasure all that's new and true in the game
Easy living while we're pimping what we know we're dreaming of
We are one having fun walking in the glow of a thug


First it was me and my pistol, but since the last mistrial
Spin up a Cristal, I'm living it up
My lawyer, K.O.'d the case, checked the lawbook for my name
I sit in courtrooms and throw signs like I'm a Mason
Money is power, envy is cash, breed evil
I could be robbed with the jewels I drop
Came into the store a year ago
I decided to stack chips on the whip
Push the hoot, now I be sitting on Beach Huevo
Contemplating coping the Coupe... Hmm, should﻿ I?
Ghetto as I wanna be, I say ""What up dude?""
When I breach you serve you bricks, through time to beat you
Send you back if you headed to your people
Threw out my chest when I make power moves like I'm right on the L




You wanna, party with me, come on, party with me
Oh, you don't wanna party with me, it's aight with me
Shorty, what's your favorite champagne, Cristal, Moet or Dom P?
Lighten up, get a bottle boo, but it ain't on me
I'm caught up, in my ghetto way of thinking
From the ice, to the minks, to the champagne we drinking
Big boys is playing Benzos with AMG kits and 20 inch Lorenzos
Follow me, round and round, the club
3 and a quarter drop-tops with hard tops
20 whips for chip; that's it. Average joes who flip bricks
My team flash keys like they grow on trees
When it's hot, park the whips and ride bikes
If you  through traffic on the turn-bikes, aight

Sweet hour of prayer!
Sweet hour of prayer!
That calls me from a world of care
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief
And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By Thy return, sweet hour of prayer!
Sweet hour of prayer!
Sweet hour of prayer!
The joys I feel, the bliss I share
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for Thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Savior shows His face
And gladly take my station there
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer!


Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!

Sipping coffee in a corner booth

Let me in it


You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothing


Nothing like you

Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you


When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy


I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody

I realize today nothing is more vestigial
Than the young space walkin’ individual
For years and years bubbling up with soul power
To detonate this planet or reach another

Yeah we take it up a notch
We diggin’ the shit so deep like ralston digs scotch
Botch this and i’ll regret it no that’s not what i’m saying
Remember this instead i’m staying
We played in a little house where conditions got squalid
But where we at now – solid

We hauled a van with a rv that was a bad call
It all went up in flames but i haven’t seen it all
Homey steps to me and say hey where ya goin’
Oh just headin’ back to where i done my growin’
If you must go somewhere over the rainbow
The adventures of a cosmic hero
From planet to planet my tags a crater
If you’re not in the future you’re not here either
Labeled psychedelic we can play disco
When the going gets weird you know the weird turn pro

I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, ""Fuck it, let the music be his""
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?

Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6"" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, ""Fuck the world"" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop

And the heat is rising
Everything inside is screaming turn around now
Just run and hide
But, I've been doing that for my whole life
Yeah, it's now or never
I said it's now or never


I come in peace
Feeling like Michael Corleone when he dropped his piece
I thought I burned that house, so I tossed the keys
I must've never lost the pics, 'cause they're haunting me
Autumn leaves, uh
My DM's like a Slip'n'Slide
I need it like a needle, I can't sleep at night
Hedonism, I didn't heed advice
Now I'm in the fetal, dang Pops was right
I was like a kid in a candy store
A sour one, couldn't find what I was lookin' for
I grew up wanting to sing and rep the gospel
You keep your nose clean when you grow up Penecostal
Found a new way 'cause that was hard to follow
This was easier to taste, but hard to swallow
Like you leave the buffet, feeling weak and hollow
So I ran to a legend like there's no tomorrow

Better than to 
Known better than to 
Uh uh, uh, known better than to

Yeah, my idol said I'm Lauryn Hill
Then I woke up to a record deal
A fresh start'll take my mind off the sex appeal
I still want the women, but I'll let 'em chill
I guess it was a pipe dream
Made it to the league, not the right team
They shoulda known ain't another artist like me
And I came from a genre that don't like me
Wifey left and I couldn't go get her
Too focused on tryna be a tone setter, uh
By the time I could see the whole set-up
The label fell apart and my home was no better, uh
So glad I could call on my brother
We made a whole album and he let me keep the money
So sad that I lost Mya's mother
And even though we moving on, I'm always gonna love her, yeah ya'll


I shoulda known better 
I shoulda known better 
I shoulda known better 
I shoulda known…

Overall, I had a blast, even last year
No regrets, just passing here
And I ain't exiting to come back
I ain't been booked in like 2 months
And half the check-ins spent half the check, yeah
And I knew this whole thing was gon' be tentative
I seen a pretty penny payed for some penitence
I seen people judge people
Be enemies, be friends then different and then be friends again
And say that's forgiveness, but that's an industry I was committed in
That's how Christian rap get dividends
That's some new friends, you get what you got
I knew from the get-go that my cousin was finna pop
So in seven years, some people will love you just to leverage it
Don't look too long that those with limited celebrities
Sittin' next to this puppy to keep it real
Can't depend on record deals, I'm here switching careers

That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the Marble Arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
I remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above, all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Your face lit up the city
Two worlds came together
The memory stays for evermore
So different your fashion
You were the main attraction
Heads turning in wonder
I felt myself go under

Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand

Nothing can stop you when you
Feel the love
No chains can hold you when you
Feel the love
Don't try to fight it when you
Feel the love
Nobody matters but the one you love

My facade starts to crumble
So strange your reaction
I made the right connection now
You got me no bother
I can't see any other
The world keeps on turning
I wouldn't care if it was burning

It's a million to one
You should find the right door
But there's no guarantee
You'll find what you're looking for
Don't give up if you blow it the first time around
But you've got to beware
If you're walking on air
Keep your feet on the ground

Don't stop me I'm not dreaming

I just came here just to make you holler
Doing it for hours, even in the shower
Over and over again
Baby, I'm all up in your garden, kissing flowers
Are you ready? I'ma take what's mine and get comfortable
Slow and easy, I'm kinda tipsy off this wine
So what I say might be a little confusing
I got a Magnum in my wallet, I'ma pull it out, I bet that I use it

When will the princess figure it out
She ain't worth saving
Heavy the head that bears the crown
Of my mistaken, apathy for sympathy
I was never good enough to be anything but remedy
To all of your constant pressing needs
And I never learned, so


I painted a picture of the things I wanted most
To color in the darker side of all my brightest hopes
But there's a monster standing where you should be
So I'll paint you wings
And I'll set you free
Yeah


I was a pawn in all of your plans, you kept me busy
Locked behind your chamber doors when you felt frisky
Until you got sick of me

I'm just taking my time to stand in line
For a dance with you, woah, dance with you, oh
It may not appear, but it's been fully clear
That I'm standing here, fully pleading, near bleeding
Dying, competing for a chance with you, oh, whoa

You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

Oh, perfect and, perfect and, perfect and
So unaware of my longing stare

There comes a time when you swim or sink
So I jumped in the drink
'Cause I couldn't make myself clear
Maybe I wrote in invisible ink
Oh, I've tried to think
How I could have made it appear

But another illustration is wasted
'Cause the results are the same
I feel like a ghost who's trying to move your hands
Over some Ouija board in the hopes I can spell out my name


What some take for magic at first glance
Is just sleight-of-hand depending on what you believe
Something gets lost when you translate
It's hard to keep straight
Perspective is everything

And I know now which is which
And what angle I oughta look at it from
I suppose I should be happy to be misread
Better be that than some of the other things I have become


But nobody wants to hear this tale
The plot is clichéd, the jokes are stale
And baby we've all heard it all before
Oh, I could get specific but
Nobody needs a catalog
With details of love I can't sell anymore


And aside from that, this chain of reaction
Baby, is losing a link

What if I don’t want to put on all that make up?
Who says I must conceal what I’m made of?
Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem
Whose job is it to straighten out my curves?
I’m so tired of that image, that’s my word
What if today I don’t feel like putting heels on?

Why is being unique such an impurity?
Why are the numbers on the scale like a God to me?
All of these indifferences are based on our appearances
We please to be appeased
The truest pleasure is the fact that we can breathe
Think it into existence, do it, then achieve
A fairy tale reality, beauty was with a beast

People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you 
Need you 


Since you left me, if you see me with another
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although they may be cute, it's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

Like Peter Pan in Neverland, all alone

And I'm still singin' for my supper, like I've always done
But now the business and the politics have taken most the fun
But I'll be out there chasin' sundown
And I'll be home in God knows when

There are a plethora of inclinations in that department. That isn't something measurable. Get stuffed! I'm returning to the salt mines. I'm just following in their footsteps. This Encante Serum should not be resold. I presume that we can reach a mutual understanding. This could change. Luckily, how can I win? Keep reading to find out the secrets of my success.

Your shadow walks faster than you
You don't really know what to do
Do you think that you're not alone?
You really think that you are immune to it
It's going to get that the best of you
It's going to lift you up and let you down
Mmm-mmm-mmm


It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
After it takes away all that
You learn to love


Your reflection is a blur
Out of focus
But in confusion
The frames are suddenly burnt
And in the end of a roll of illusion
A ghost waiting its turn
Now I can see right through
It's a warning that nobody heard


It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that
You learn to love
But you don't always have to hold your head
Higher than your heart


You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not so
Hope you're not alone


Your echo comes back out of tune
Now you can quite get used to it
Reverb is just a room
The problem is that there's no truth to it
It's fading way too soon
The shadow is on the move
And maybe you should be moving too


Before it takes away all that you learned to love
It will defeat you and then teach you to get back up

Wonder what it was that made you this way?
Maybe as a baby, you dropped your rattle
It still rattles you to this day
You better practice your evil looks in the mirror, they don't work on me
Slowly crawling up from the down low
The other cops still call you fatso
A short fuse and a top to blow
Unhappy wife, shitty life, hit the bottle


Your whole world dropped from under you
Left you with sorry excuses
Left you with meaningless things to prove
Like why you became a cop
Why did you become a cop?

I can't pull your heart together with just my voice alone

You cut the peace out of me

And as the light in you went dark
I saw you turn to shadow
If you would salvage some part of you that once knew love

From faces that you never see
Oh I've gotta save my blood
From all that you've broken

This double life you lead is eating you up from within
A thousand shards of glass you pushed beneath my skin
And left me lying there to bleed

I only held you closer
But as the light in you went dark I saw you turn over
I wanted always to be there for you and close to you

My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed

That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain, impending disaster
Souls crying, the Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?

Purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, Hell awaits

Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy

Nothin' 'bout ya, amnesia

B-both pockets, filled up
Nothin' but dead folks

Tried to play but I played you

Which accompanied me to the following day to even up the score
In a stone cold sober mood next afternoon at ten

And I told myself not to drink again

I was three sheets to the wind
The three shots did me in
Three angels there above me
As I was lying on the floor
I knew I should have run for the hills
But I still wanted more

I don't remember the chapel but I woke up with a wife
I looked at her, she looked at me and now we're hooked for life

We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
'Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone


A thorn in the side of the earth
Where do you draw the line?
A flaw in the design
The rest is history
This defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away

We live in an infinite growth paradigm. Nothing grows forever, it's not possible. As a great psychologist James Hillman wrote
""The only thing that grows in the human body after a certain age is cancer"", and I think that, that's clearly what we're seeing at the end of human industrial civilization with the population approaching seven billion


We're all guilty as sin
I feel it, I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger
We may be infinite, but this world is not
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot
That we long forgot


We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
'Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone


We're all guilty as sin
I feel it, I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger
We may be infinite, but this world is not
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot

Dear momma's boy, I know you've had your butt licked by your mother
I know you've enjoyed all that attention from her
And every woman graced with your presence after
Dear narcissus boy, I know you've never really apologized for anything
I know you've never really taken responsibility
I know you've never really listened to a woman
Dear me-show boy I know you're not really into conflict resolution
Or seeing both sides of every equation
Or having an uninterrupted conversation


And any talk of healthiness
And any talk of connectedness
And any talk of resolving this
Leaves you running for the door



Dear egotist boy, you've never really had to suffer any consequence
You've never stayed with anyone longer than ten minutes
You'd never understand anyone showing resistance
Dear popular boy I know you're used to getting everything so easily
A stranger to the concept of reciprocity
People honor boys like you in this society


And any talk of selflessness
And any talk of working at this
And any talk of being of service
Leaves you running for the door

You go back to the women who will dance the dance
You go back to your friends who will lick your ass
You go back to ignoring all the rest of us
You go back to the center of your universe


Dear self centered boy, I don't know why I still feel affected by you
I've never lasted very long with someone like you
I never did although I have to admit I wanted to
Dear magnetic boy you've never been with anyone who doesn't take your shit
You've never been with anyone who's dared to call you on it
I wonder how you'd be if someone were to call you on it


And any talk of willingness
And any talk of both feet in
And any talk of commitment
Leaves you running for the door

You go back to the women who will dance the dance
You go back to your friends who will lick your ass
You go back to being so oblivious
You go back to the center of the universe

Feelings you see are so hard to believe
All the chaos I have in my heart
Devils I make and the love can't relate
All the solace inside tears me up


Take me away, set me on fire
There's no other way


Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained
I'm so lost and lonely now


Weaving deceits is so easy for me
'Cause the loathing I've had from the start
Evil disease, all the hatred it breeds
As I'm down on my knees, torn apart


Take me away, set me on fire
There's no other way


Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained
I'm so lost and lonely now


Where do I run? Where do I hide?
Give me a reason to end my life
Where do I run? Where do I hide?
Give me a reason to get out alive


Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained
I'm so lost and lonely now
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain

"And the wills of the river
Leads you here
Where the wind it is yielding
And the light it is clear

To rest upon forever
Or to live for one more day
No I won't restrain the morning
I'll get ready for this spring

Oh see them planets shining
To the south to the north
Headed out the west wind
Going to find myself a home

Where the night it is guarded
By the shores of the sea
And the moon it is resting
While the sun it breaks free

And the world is all alone now
While it's children still sleep

Blastin', dumpin'
Bitch


I got my pistol cocked and my knife
'Bout to slice this nigga windpipe
Throwin' tops, swervin' me on the dice
Nigga thought he was nice with the slickness
But the nigga I am, sham, just swift with the quickness 
Respect the game, the lame niggas die slow
Hustlers fly straight like Frank feared Scarface
From the Glock, the lead waste
Diggin' out your chest plate up straight
Trimmin' you from your winge and hit the gate, I'm not waitin'
Thinking between and runnin' on my escape
Hop on the 2-10 and wait for you to retaliate
The terrorist doin' on niggas who we ​
Glock never miss, through your grill here goes my fist
When I slit yo' wrist
With the the styles of ruckus south central
Los scandalous anybody get buckets uh 
I'm doin' niggas in the rap tussle
Rip out your backbone slow, you go to pieces like a puzzle
I'm hand on muzzles to you whack MC's
Black fitted cap to the back with the Gap jeans to my knees
Niggas under siege, like Seagal they fall
To my tactics chin checkin' in charge like chart, I want it all
The loot, the chronic, plus the dips
First nigga that flinches catch a bullet from my hip
In a rage, serving gauge with my Glock to your grill
Let the dump-dumps loose, now your brains is on the ceiling nigga


Murderous mindstate
Can't keep my nine straight
Sippin' on this hennessey
Waitin' for the time to break
Show up and mothafuckas bow down, recognize
West Side, Death Row, outlaw riders
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well known felons labeled for drug sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed
Roll with thugs and dawgs
Commence to lettin' off rounds
Then escape in the fog
Who wanna see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My mini-14 murderin' niggas while they creepin', Uhhh!
Duck or you ass out!
Drink 'til you pass out! 
Ain't scared to die
Drunk drivin' in my Glasshouse
Niggas is under me
They bitches come to me
They heard the stories nigga
Now they wanna really see
Bomb first, my motto, is fully guaranteed
Niggas is playahatas
Label them my enemies then dumpin'


Look out young nigga!
'Cause it's time to dump
I'm versatile ,mothafuckas
What type of rhyme you want?
Niggas got me in they sight
Now I'm runnin' for my life
Tell me!
What's that, West Side like?
West side!


I'm all about the paper chase 'cause the paper makes life so great
Plus, haste makes waste
And I gots the whole spot lock down, concoct styles
Catch me rollin' all the fuck around with the top down 
Realest with the microphone
Most murder masher verbal disaster
Creator, 38 stasher
In the inner zone where the hellraiser roam
There is not place like home, TEC-9s and chromes
Got the heater sequence for the heat to the disperse
Just in case worse come worst, I dumps first
So pump curt curse, it's the curse of the pump pump
The one to dump last is the first to get slumped
It's the mental temptation, mental assassination
My heart skips a beat for the heat sensation
I'm death-defying, bitches lyin' sayin' I ain't cute
Now she wants an autograph  Bitch, I ain't Snoop 


One bone bitch ready to go for broke
Hittin' up your marks with my motherfuckin' 4
I'm comin' up about the Hills so feel I'm ready for the static
And niggas on my team is the full flesh automatic
Planting all you hoes in your motherfuckin' place
A bitch named Scarlo is steppin' up in your face
I'm dustin' off you chumps with the .44 slugs
And livin' from the lichter bro I'm ready to pull your plug
So, nigga, you wanna jump? You gotta jump little higher
Scarlo, nigga, the miss messiah
So bitch you better get a grip on gangs
You fuckin' with the hillside, mentally insane
Point of no return and  now my life is on the edge
Believin' in my misery I fucked her in the yeah
Giuseppe called me up and told me so
I gotta do a mission on my ass I gotta go
'Cause you can run, hide 
But I'm gonna getcha when tryna escape
You know my gat won't letcha run, hide
But I'm gonna getcha when tryna escape
You know my gat won't letcha
West side for life
Biaaaaaatch!


I'm dumpin'
Empty my gun
It's time to run
'Cause here come the cops
I'll be duckin' 'em for blocks
Nigga I'm dumpin'
Empty my clip
Forever bustin'
East Coast nigga rushin'
Mothafucka, I'll be dumpin'


Killer!
Loaded them things, nigga, it's time to dump
Sneakin' on niggas that be sleepin' when they ass in the trunk
You slipped, then got crept on, now it's ride time
To the hills where niggas kill and peel your shit on skyline
It's die time, and can't any niggas save g
So kneel to your fuckin' knees and feel this 45 fade you
Aimin' for heads, pumpin' lead 'til I bury you
Niggas be duckin' but I swingin' low like chariot
No love, pumpin' slugs like I'm servin' dogs
Buck buck, now tell your dead homies I said, ""What's up?""
Lullaby, rock-a-bye, nigga die
And rest in piece, eternal pain from this fire
My 45 smoked and broke ya
And nothin' hurt like a dick with his liquid, in his eyes wide open
Gats smokin' no jokin', Bullets to me
Deleted soul from his core, as he lay, as I was dumpin'

I've been climbing up the walls to escape the sinking feeling
But I can't hide from the nihilist at my door
Buried in the basement floor, didn't know what I had planted
It blossomed with all the heart of a Cold War


I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the true


Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out

You were in my dream last night, but your face was someone else's
A twitch in my spine, a mutual disorder
Isolation neophyte, too afraid to taste your conscience
You march in the dark, little lamb to the slaughter

Its too late, I can't change my mind
And my hopes for healing are far behind
Kiss the face of myself, taste the darkest black
When there's no way to


I've made a choice that I regret
Now what I see is what I get


A painful picture that I can't forget



Wait!
How can it be too late?
'Cause I don't want to play
With such a price to pay






I let my vision out of my sight
I see my future fading into the night
I shouldn't have played with such a price to pay
Shut off the sound, shut down the lights
It's breaking down around me and I won't pretend it's alright
And in the end I'll never be the same again



Wait!
How can it be too late?
'Cause I don't want to play
With such a price to pay

To what I can't reclaim

The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones
But we're buried by modern misery

We planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul
It grows without light and feeds from our bones

Ain't gotta have everything in your life
Goin' exactly right, to party
Maybe the opposite things are a mess
And that's the best time to burn it down
You look around here and you see all these people
You think their lives are perfect, ha, hardly

You take it all with a grain of salt
And realize sometimes it ain't your fault
You got something you don't wanna remember
That's when you need to just throw it in a blender
And have a good time
Now add tequila
When life gives you limes
You make margaritas


Now I don't know if you're the type

I daydream pretty women out in Beijing
Paris Celine hop up in that Saline
I chase dreams, white man but the face green
Same thing err' day, err' thing gleam
Fuck my reply, the bank do the statements
Had me with my savings, I was saving in my savings
Two or three bedroom shack I was raised in
The condos out in Jersey full of Jay West paintings
Talk to the boy how you talk to the Lord
Talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
Marc Jacob plates, Margiela rugs
My boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs
Hop up out the first class, hop into that E-class
Cut raw, cut school, I ain't ever see class
If so, I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class
School of hard knocks, graduated with a G pass
G-Code, street code, fake niggas; cheat code
Niggas trying to turn fake shit: green, cheap gold
I don't know how they do it for the freak show
But I ain't even go beast mode
So we toast


Fuck the pearly gates, I'm hanging by the steps
'Cause my target is my goal and I'm aiming for the best
I'm good at what I do, but I'm coming for the best spot
On the road to greatness, success is the next stop
I don't even rest,  even at a rest stop
I toast with the Gods, tell these haters take they best shot
I'ma be that motherfucker 'til my breath stop
I guess for now call me step pop


We toast for the night and drink for the day
The God shed a tear providing us rain
What a shame from the pain 'cause we used to being slaves
Made a change from the whips, shackles and the chains
But nowadays man seem a little strange
Trade his soul for the whips and the chains, what a change!
No, I couldn't tell you what the difference is
But I could tell you what the business is
I was getting dividends, probably spending Benjamins
Both kind of synonyms, in the same sentences
Tell me what a good Christian is
Better yet; when Christmas is
Waiting on my presence, I must be a gift from heaven

Turned around and took two steps, backwards
Heart out of my chest
Serving my emotion led, backwards

Bitter, never breaking bread, backwards

Keep stacking sticks to pave a path
So sick and tired of falling flat

Shut the book and hit the ground

Cut the hook and kicked the crown

She had me talkin' to myself gazin' at that mean ol' wall
She had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the hall

She tells me that she loves me but her heart's a little under grown
Well, she said she'd never leave me but she got the urge to roam

She tells me things that were not her fault

It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

Well I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

As we start trudging
Me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
Vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
Searching for the virgins of life
That be shoving out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
But can I get a level on the bass and on the treble?
Footing up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us 'cause we rarely dig acoustics
Can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting
All over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
So if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
They'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
All over the field, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield


And the musician often tries to capture the new thing so that we might have melody and have rhythm as we do our thing
It's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. Walk tall!


You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching
The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
We are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a Jeep
But dig it in the ground because the footprint now


Walk tall!


If there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
Our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said ""Black is black""
You can come while we Quest, I don't play, I don't jest
Get emotions off your chest, we are Black, we been blessed
Making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
The walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
The times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong

She's pacing the floor, she's checking the time
Wondering how the glow with that porch light hasn't gone out
'Cause it's been on now for three days straight
He’s been nowhere to be found
Probably drowning in the neon, where the wagon broke down
She called up his mama and his friends in town
But they ain't seen him
Another night of no sleepin'

Will it end? Nobody knows

Memory loss, well let me remind you
That flow water like a fucking monsoon
If I see her and I want her I might get your mom soon
Now I'm your daddy forever
Wordplay really clever
That real shit 'imma slip her
Now she my cinderella
I want her 'imma cop her
Yea 'imma buy her hella
If she was down to earth
Now her attitude pr-pr-pr-pr-propella
Swing my way
Girl I make every day feel like a Friday
It's the appetizer wait until the entre
And I'll be god damned if I let you take some fucking food off of my plate
Cause when I'm on a plane I be on the way
And when I'm on the way she say ándale
Rollin' with my niggas tryna get a change
Now we ran our bands up, I'm the one to blame


I try to play numb to shit like this
But I'm cool, cause this isn't love
We all have obsessions, oh, sometimes, sometimes
Cause when I'm on the road, I be on the road
I mean you can hold me down, but I'm not to hold
Riding with my niggas we the ones they chose
Running through the city like, ""I know you know!""
Forever

Oh, I think I've found a way to keep myself whole
I write my fears on green notes

I swallow my doubts away and watch them grow old
Is that why the past years seemed slow?


Take me my heart and my soul
Pick me apart and look inside, inside
Fill me with dreams I can't hold
Keep me afloat in this cold world, cold world


Tell me it won't hurt
Now I, I'm your passenger
The old me, won't work
Now I, I'm your passenger

I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger

Oh I think I've found a way to keep my hands full
I spend long nights, oh I question my self-control


Take me my heart and my soul
Pick me apart and look inside, inside
Fill me with dreams I can't hold
Keep me afloat in this cold world, cold world

Now all of the debts that I owe
Oh they keep me useful, my head held tall
Now I can't accept what I lost
You can make me balanced, but you can't make me whole
So


Tell me it won't hurt

I'm your passenger

Well I came from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee
I'm going to Louisiana
My true love for to see
It had rained all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The sun so hot I froze to death
Susanna don't you cry
I got a long way to go
I sure feel it now
Deep down in these dusty clothes
Through another town
Backed up with capricious souls
I got a long way to go
I got a lot left to say
To the empty seat
The stood beside me through the fray
To the midnight moon
Who saw it fit to light my way
I got a lot left to say


But where do I got from here
When I'm lost out on the road
And the way's not clear
To find my way back home
I need to hear
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you


I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna
Coming down the hill
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
Says I'm coming from the south
Susanna don't you cry




Soon we'll be in New Orleans
Then I'll look around
And when I find Susanna
I'll fall down on the ground
And if I do not find her
Then I shall surely die
And when I'm dead and buried
Susanna Don't you cry for me

Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred past unfolds


Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness, of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold


Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears




I remember Mother praying
Father too, on bended knee
The sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me




Precious memories fill my soul

Sour life can turn sweet, it’s laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
Don’t be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes

Good life is contradiction because of the crucifixion
If you’re ready and have the need, I will take your soul and plant my seed

You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you’re going up the stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don’t forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers send electric lies


We’re disturbing the priest, won’t you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest, not at all, not at all, not in the least
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all, not at all, not in the least

The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set alight
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside
The devil and the priest can’t exist if one goes away
It’s just like the battle of the sun and the moon and night and day
The force of the devil, that’s we’re all told to fear
Watch out for religion when he gets too near too near


We’re disturbing the priest, won’t you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest, not at all, not at all, not in the least

Good life is contradiction because of the crucifixion
If you’re ready and have the need, I will take your soul and plant my seed

Let’s try getting to the sky, hang on or you’re going to die

Come up in the club
I’m ‘bout to get my ass kicked
‘Cause I’m sippin’ on some Gin
Sip-sippin’ on some Jack
Slip 60 in her panties with my number on the back


‘Cause the proof is in the Kodak
The throw-backs in a dark and vacant corner
You were freezing, I was warmer
And the roof is blown, you know that
And baby chases like she don’t know what she’s seeing
I was steady, you were fleeting

What happened to the keys
That used to jingle in your pocket?

But your eyes say I should stop it
If I regret all I’ve done
I would be trapped inside that locket

The postman delivered, a ""past due"" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash on the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast, I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee


Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me


Last night you came home late, and I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
And I thought, ""It don't matter, 'cause it's the holiday season""
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you, and I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete


Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me


So excuse me for looking, like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking, like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving, and being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

Was to have you walk out on me

Used to say a lot of things fell in love at seventeen
Took you places and I shown you things that you ain't never seen
Thinking 'bout you all the time, wishing you were mine
Don't know what you got
But it's something I can't find

Gotta read between the lines
And I don't want nothing with you no more

Put on a new pair of underwear
Sat on the porch with my labrador
Like a hundred other times before
She changed her shoes and freshened up her face
Put on some skimpy, sexy lace
Finally made her way through the back screen door
We loaded up on the front seat of my Ford


And we went out to dinner and we drove right back home
Watched an old movie and drank a half a bottle of rum
And then we turned off the TV and we got right down to it
There ain't nothing left to do now that we've done it


Seems like it happens every time
We get a chance to reignite that fire
We burn it fast and then retire
Just before the news on channel 5




After all these years, it can get routine
You change the order up, or use different names
Try it in the morning, or the middle of the day
The end results are still the same




Oh Lord we turned off the TV and we got right down to it
There ain't nothing left to do now that we've done it

Defying limits from start to finish, third eye the witness
Lion emperor   light up the indica when I'm in the club
Innocent but she into thugs
Independent just spread love

Light years beyond it, pondered on it
Probably taking a shit
Bitch, I torment any rapper think he want it
Casket quick, they ass get kicked
My passion like the axis to the globe
Like christ of nazareth ho, ho
Ascending master when I grab the micro
A psycho, Destructo Disk with the light flow

I will rise like a tidal
Wave my hands to my rivals
Got seven grams in my system
Running from religion, sinning

Cause a nigga soul lifted
You should exercise your wisdom
Or sit and die victim, swiftly dissect them nigga

Reckless spending, do we got enough wealth to feed the peasants? Damn, get the message dream free and independent
Hope our people get to stepping cause our brains the strongest weapon

Cause these so called friends would end this shit for some treasure

Proceed to watch from distant lines, but i dare you to flock a genius mind

Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger has gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
They're burning into the night
There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?


This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in


Oh, superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow?
The men of steel, these men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go around
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

When the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright all through the night
In the wake of this madness, as I held you tight
So long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Making too many problems

Yeah, the streets was my sensei
I sold dope then rapped about it on my mixtape
I had respect but I gained more
You rather be underrated or unemployed?
Hmm, think on it

And about a half a key of some Coca Cola

Put 'em in my range, aim nigga take fire
Watch 'em die, should've never fucked around when it's time to ride

Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore

A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
And though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back


It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

You, now I see, keeping everything inside

We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still

Sing a call to a morning dove
Over the prairie, through the hills
I hear it still in the singing of the bread
From your lips which splashed my dull house
With music


I went out walking in the wood
By a river which never sleeps
All I bare, all I sieve
I thought of you so presently


I dreamt of the warmest days of love
Which knew not sorrow nor betrayal
When truth was will in the singing of the gale
But when I lay in a verdant field
None could stay my rising


I went out walking in the wood
And the light casts long from the moon
And life is short as a breath half-taken
I could not wait to tell you the truth


I have been waiting on you

Can I blame daddy cause he left me?
Wish he would've hugged me too much like him

Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends did
Promise I won't hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go


All the world is ours

You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing at CBGB's, have a real good gig
Hey, you never know


'Cause, baby, we were born to live fast and die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on


If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay


We gonna go far
I can already taste it, kid
L.A.'s gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go


Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid
I can be your Nancy, you can be my Sid
Get into some trouble like our parents did
Hey, they'll never know


'Cause baby, we were born to be bad and move on
Built to go fast and stay strong
Honey, you and me, and no one
Just believe, come on


If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say

Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay


I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparkling like a new dime
I came over, ""Hello, can you be mine?
Can you be mine? Can you be mine?""


If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say

It's a short trip, only getting one
Can count on you, my love, more than anyone?
Never let me go

It's another interlude motherfucker
You know it's Animal the Mixtape Bully nigga, MTB
You know how I do it the way I do it when I do it the way I do it
Motherfucker stab you in your throat with a icepick
Shoot you in the face with a beebee gun
Whatever I do to bring you to the conrete I'mma do it, you heard?
My motherfuckin nigga A, it's the closin of the album nigga
I salute you nigga, for never bein a bitch
For never bein a bitch-ass nigga 
Cryin, retirin, sayin you comin back to the game
Go findin God and comin back, keep gettin shot and comin back
Niggas doin mixtapes and comin back
Lyin 'til y'all caught with guns and comin back
Keep comin back baby, you in the top five man
Y'all niggas pay The Source for mics man
Cause you don't know how to be an original nigga from the streets
I respect you man, close it out like this, 2-double-oh-5
Fuck the world, you heard, say what's up A.W.O.L. take it


I am one of the flyest, crew is like the Al'Qaeda's
We war like in the mess halls of Elmyra
Bodies get caught, predicate spells is higher
Why talk if you ain't walk through hell's fire
All-nighters, upscale attire
In car get new cars you and your mans admire
Young messiah, back bottom guns for hire
I am that what the rap contracts require
Ghostwriter, coast to coast cyphers
I do this for them grown men in diapers that don't like us
Though, still the nicest, sendin kites to Rikers is priceless
Reminiscin on past life fights with Cypress
Hung lifeless, sprung from financial crisis
Never ran, I stand amongst the righteous
AZ-Q, dark denimy V suits
His, arson is lethal, only pardon his people so
Just ask it open or closed casket
Coke or the dope acid I'm back on that old Shaft shit
Got my ratchets, army fatigue jacket
Fitted cap on backwards with them cats from Flatbush
Bravehearted, fuck if they say squash it
We remain the largest, we invade regardless
Trains to Spofford insane with a brain from Hartford
It's hard to explain my artwork
One for the haters, two for the true and the raiders
I know dudes who eat your food with a razor
It's major, barbaric, brutal behavior
Called addict, I talk about the jewelry later
My respect is for the DL cartel connects
And the crews that came through and left arise well effect
Finesse, big boys only play with the best
It's no regrets, bein dead broke and raised in the 'jects
I'm a vet, cousin Comstock callin collect
Sayin he just left the box hot annoyed and depressed
Claimin he stressed did a 3 still facin the stress
I'm like look this ain't the vote and you ain't facin your death
So save your breath, tie your boots up and bang with the rest
Cause in reality they just incarcerated your flesh
You know the deal, I pray they process your appeal
Cause on the real, I still got my hands on the wheel
And I'mma drive 'til the gas run out
Either crash or a wrap 'til a smash come out
We them real niggas

"How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

I went up to the window
Lightning banging on the cymbals
I ripped into the night
Came storm into your eyes

My horse had worked the fields too long
My bear had lost his innate calm
It's true enough we're not at peace
But peace is never what it seems

Our love is not the light it was
When I walk inside the dark I'm gone
While we look for where it went
It's only echoes in the valley of love

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

We waste time on blame and weak revenge
Waste energy on projections
We're living proof we've gotta let go
And stop looking through the halo

We carry on as if the time is through
You carry on as if I don't love you
And so we find the way is out
To cut the heart out of the doubt now

The room's full but hearts are empty
Like the letters never sent me
Your words are like a lasso
But you're an instrumental tune

"When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tires screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet
One way ticket out of here


Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities, in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots
The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats
Public enema number one



A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the world dies screaming

See, I just walked in fresher

And do it like Beyoncé, and put it on Sean 
Grind hard, but I got a lot to show for it

And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All, all up in my face, like, ""You remember who I am?""

Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants, now she rockin' Sean john

I'm just doin' better than what everyone projected
I knew that I'd be here, so if you asked me how I feel 
I'ma just tell you, it's everythin' that I expected, bitch

One time for the Westside, Westside, let me see them
Hands up in the air, the air

At 12:25 AM Wednesday, 2Pac was on his way into a time square building to record at an eight-floor studio with another rapper. But in the lobby, Shakur was shot several times, including two graze wounds to the head. 2Pac's lawyers said the attack appeared to be a setup


Against doctors orders, 2Pac Shakur checked himself out of the hospital less than 24 hours after being shot 5 times on the way into a Manhattan recording studio


2Pac Shakur secures one clean legal victory this year, as he's dismissed of assault charges brought against him when he allegedly shot at two off-duty Atlantic cops on Halloween last year. The case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence


More controvery surrounding 2Pac Shakur ...


Meanwhile, in 2Pac news, at about 6:45 tonight, Shakur may have lowered his own chances of surviving the attack by checking himself out of the hospital that probably saved his life


2Pac Shakur checked into the Metropolitan Hospital yesterday under an assumed name. His lawyers said that he had connections, but wouldn't say what kind, that could provide top notch security for the injured rap star


Shakur underwent surgery today ...


The shooting of 2Pac Shakur here in New York City once again underscores the violence that has surrounded this man since he shot to superstardom in the world of music and entertainment

"Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds vail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me
The judge said, ""Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, though it ment my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife
Now the schaffold is high, and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But some times at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones
She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds vail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me

Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
You lay your bets and then you pay the price


The things we do for love
The things we do for love


Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number
And your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down


The things we do for love
The things we do for love


Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall

Ooh you made me love you

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree
But disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of

Fiends on my line every time the phone ring
Since eighteen, sipping codeine
Promethazine covered all on my spleen
Aquamarine trapping out of the water
My alma mater is the school of the slaughter
Every since I first heard, ""Wanna Be A Baller""

No commas or dollars
Just stank marijuana I got from Nevada
I'm hitting nirvana and fucking Madonna

Full of those drunken trees

"In a tattoo shop at the end of Main
Two lovers set out with no restraint
He swore she was the one from day one
She swore he made her complete
In a tattoo shop at the end of Main
Above his heart they carved Jesse's name

The years flew by so fast underneath their feet
Bills to pay just tryin' to make ends meet
A buddy asked him why he chose the road that he was on
Asked him how he kept form goin' insane
And in a little bar at the end of Main
He pulled off his shirt and he showed 'em Jesse's name

'Til late one night came a phone call
That said, ""You gotta come home from work
'Cause the baby says it's time for me to go
And I know it's a little early and I thought I could wait
But baby I can't stand the pain""
And in a hospital room at the corner of 5th and Main
They gave their little miracle Jesse's name

Seventy years, gray haired and still in love
Holding' hands like they were still 18
They both knew Jesse's time was growin' short
Somehow they both chose not to believe
And in a hospital room at the corner of 5th and Main
Oh he cried the last time Jesse said his name

And in a field lined with daisies
They laid her in the ground
As their daughter held the man that they both loved
And as the preacher said his words
And the choir began to sing
Oh he felt the pain
Underneath Jesse's name
Underneath Jesse's name

In a tattoo shop at the end of Main
He remembers the day they carved Jesse's name

I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight
I was told when niggas bark you should bite
And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough pedigree to scare something
They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin
Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest
Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman
I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong
Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face
Tell hop out that bucket and spray
Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist
Tell them to circle round the block twice in case
Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death
Scream fuck the world with a capital F
Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left
And this is how we think


No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war


And when I say hard body, homie, not in a physical
You either born with it or real niggas around real kids
And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it
You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences
And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred
Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?
I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots
Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid
We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it
You either fall now or stand with it
You either crawl now or get laid down
Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late
Motherfucker, meet your fate




Look between my eyes
You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five
Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit
Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits
Put them on our feet and reshape them shits
Now don’t they look sweet?
Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week
That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic
You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets
Mel Gibson, you just actin'
Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice
Teach you niggas a lesson or two
Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you?
Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga
You rappers ain’t built like us
Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough
We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff
And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs
The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust




Tongue tissue ass niggas man, ay wait, we say, either go hard or go home, tha- tha- tha- that’s what we go by, either stand for something or fall for anything nigga, bite that, o- open your mouth, bite that go ahead, you’re suicidal

I came across a bunch of snaps and letters
I found an eight by ten, taken God knows when
It took me back to when we found each other
How did I let it start
If I could only remember

The tender parts we played
I thought we had it made
The recipe for life, the perfect fusion
But when the love turned sour
I found the happy hour
But drinking for the world is no solution
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Why did I break your heart
The cost of loving is a heavy burden
Somebody's gotta take the strain
The things we said would make a cover story
But who's gonna say
Who should take all the blame
We analysed ourselves
It didn't really help
No one to referee, no rhyme no reason
I thought we had the best
But when you flew the nest
My heart decided it was open season
How did I let it start

"Hot summer night, the working girls were on their way back home
It was getting late so I tagged along, couldn't let them walk alone
I followed them up some greasy steps to a rooftop in the sky
No walls around just a sea of stars, my throat was getting dry

Everyone could feel the heat that's why we all disrobed
Our clothes and inhibitions went off flying 'cross the globe
Dancing crazy getting loose and closer to the edge
I could feel my blood was up and it was pounding in my head

So there I was, just me and the girls
Under the moonlight on the top of the world

As things were dying down we retreated from the precipice
I lay beside the most beautiful girl in the universe
Her name was Venus in Heaven
She fed me rice and offered me wine
I accepted ambrosia and nectar
From an amber goddess
I collapsed between the thighs of Morpheus
Next thing I felt was a sharp pain of sunrise
My mouth was open and full of rice
As I managed to prize open one of my eyes
I saw Luigi the cockroach carry off his prize
And there lay Venus still sprawled out and naked for sure
But not quite what she was the night before
I made my excuses and left through the door
Stepped into space at the twentieth floor
And that's why I don't like heights no more

To a place where planets shifting
The moon's erased, its features lifting the glare

Who keeps the pace and clears the rubble
And lost in space, fills up the bubble with air

I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too, but what cares I for praise ?
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""


In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49


My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49




There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49




There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49




There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49




Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign
""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 ""

"In May of nineteen forty-one the war had just begun
The Germans had the biggest ship that had the biggest guns
The Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And evry British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

We'll find that German battleship thats makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The Hood found the Bismark and on that fatal day
The Bismark started firin' fifteen miles away
We gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away
The mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people ""Put ev'ry ship a-sail""
Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta send the Bismark to the bottom of the sea

We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismark made its' run
The admiral of the British fleet said ""Turn those bows around""
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismark, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
""Sink the Bismark"" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
We hit the decks a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
Yeah, we found the mighty Bismark and then we cut her down

Lying in the park on a beautiful day
Sun shine on the grass and the children play
Siren’s passing, fire engine's red
Someone’s house is burning down on a day like this

The evening comes and we’re hanging out
On the front step and a car rolls by with the windows rolled down
And that War song is playing, “Why Can’t We Be Friends?”
Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs


Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
Somebody’s going hungry and someone else is eating out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody’s heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song


The way your mouth feels in a lover's kiss
Like a pretty bird on a breeze or water to a fish
A bomb blast brings the building crashing to the floor
Hear the laughter while the children play war


Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier’s last breath, his baby’s being born


Standing on the bridge, watch the water passing under me
It must’ve been much harder when there was no bridge, just water
Now the world is small, remember how it used to be
With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars


Watch the sky in a jet plane, so far out of my reach
Is there someone up there looking down on me?
Boy chase a bird, so close but every time
He’ll never catch her, but he can’t stop trying

Barely holding together
Mapless zone the road signs hold
Keep ahead of the weather

Find a break in the highway

Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home

"On the verge I'm a fragile design
Will I wake in a world of fire
As a part inside of me just want to die
Feel my DNA's changing and twisting my mind

There's a monster within me
Let me out of here
Change my destiny

Will I wake with a life to remember
Now I'm frozen and cold
I am left alone
With an empty soul
As I put the future on hold

Needles and cables plugged into machines
My memory's fighting
Half man half machine

What I learned
I was part of a plan
Yet I'm waiting for new directions

There's a monster within me
Let me out of here
From captivity

Will I wake with a life to remember
Now I'm frozen and cold
I am left alone
With an empty soul
As I put the future on hold

Divine
I render the gods design
Humanity's fading
Why can't I die

Will I wake with a life to remember
Now I'm frozen and cold
I am left alone
With an empty soul
As I put the future on hold

Now I'm frozen and cold
I am left alone

"We met on New Years Eve in New York City
How cold it had been then and soon will be again
We could’ve lived together and given up our dreams of wandering
We could’ve left together and given up our dreams of the home we could keep

You may travel alone and still be accompanied by my love

We parted by my birthday and without you here I am a different age
How bright I had been then and fear it may not ever show again
So continue to live alone and speak not your thoughts of land or holiday and I will leave again and make all new plans to fill the space that you left

I do travel alone and yours is not a number I can call on the phone

Too lazy, shake the gray
So, and she willed the rain
So let me be defamed

Tired of the shadowing
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

Tongue whipping forked black
How long until you crack
Surprised and set back

Couple blocks down from the liquor store
I got a love seat and a couple DVD's we can watch
...or not
I can call a car it will be two minutes
'Til it's at the bar and we hop in it
It's pretty clear that we're both here to get over someone


So if you wanna come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and baby I got mine


But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you’ve been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you


There's a reason that we're both here right now
And a reason everything didn't work out
We're two sets of previous relationships at the same time


Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you

I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised


Your mother says that I'm a stranger
A face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise darling
I'll see you on God's golden shore


Through this open world I'm a-bound to ramble
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain
I'm a-bound to ride that morning railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train

If I'd know-ed how bad you'd treat me

"This is life 
But it's paradise for me


From the cradles to the stiff coffin, legit fortune
I lean for them corner fiends, crip-walking
Wedding-bells I'm out of that shell of slick talking
Honeymoon, deep scuba diving, kissing the dolphins
I lived, though I quit flossing, I forgive though this shit's costing
At the crib with the kids often, coasting
Ski-boating on the beach ocean
Hoping them old closed cases never re-open
Moving, y'all minor leagues, I'm like speed motion
Muscles thru my white tees bulking, he's holding
Hypnotic, spit shit you sit and vibe with, melodic
A mental escape through all the garbage


This is life 


One in a million, I'm strong young and appealing
Was born son of a villain, put on in front of my building
Peeping how the street structured, deceased brothers
Critique, but I was placed here to reach others
Incomplete, staying feet from the deep cover
Eternal sleep, I wonder if the Beast love us
The frail weaken, the stronger be in jail eating
The average male will make it home if the bail's decent
I inhale frequent, it alleviate weight
To be a part of the game can't be a day late
To be a part of the sane, need a G a day take
Five if you live, slide mines on the side




Mics, money, and music my life's for you to view it
I stand militant, my stripes came from the sewage
Interrogation lights, spent nights up in the cubics
Fistfights, I'm nice like Earl Huvick
Harmonizing, narration is traumatizing
Here since '94, it's still kinda surprising
I touched topics, safe-boxes, unlocked it
Complete zone keep my tone on one octave
Owe nothing, won't ask to hold nothing
Clean behind the scene, but control buttons
Brought it back for the essence that got watered in rap
Cause of my aura I bring more to a track

Towards the mountains and the clouds

Blind yet hypnotized
I swear I know not why
Those eyes have always left me dry

How near, how far, how lost they are
How near, how far, how lost they are
How near, how far, how lost they are

While my brothers and me lay around in the shade of that live oak tree on the hill

Overlooking momma's porch with a fresh coat of paint
And a shiny new Coup De Ville

I've been through hell and found myself on the wrong end of a gun
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven but it's closer than I've ever been

The rain is coming down
So prepare for war
You can't run that far
You got to stand your ground
There's no more days to count


I was there for you
I'd have died for you
I changed my life for you
But you couldn't keep it true
You'll never know how hard
I hit the ground that day
The changing of the guard
The bitter taste it gave


Winds are starting to blow out there
It's only yours if you run for it
Sow that seed with no regrets
Gets so hard when you know you want it all


It's in your poetry
I knew you'd come for me
And all the subtleties
Of what was meant to be
You could hear the call
When you jumped to fall
Just remember now
It's 'cause you want it all


Winds are starting to blow out there
It's only yours if you run for it
Sow that seed with no regrets
Gets so hard when you know you want it all
You want it all

You want it all

It was the night Rod Stewart played
And we were, were standing in the pouring rain
If I had known it was the last time I would see you again...
I would change everything...
I look through the broken glass I watch the storm go through my mind
There's so much I had to say I know the words I left behind
And now I'm caught in a daydream with nowhere to run and hide
The world rushes by me, it's leaving me here all alone



I'll always carry you inside my heart and you
You'll never know how much I wonder where you are
I always knew that you would take a part of me away with you
And I never got to say good-bye


I look in the mirror now and all I see is yesterday
At night I hear your voice and it is calling out my name
And with every hour just hold on to what you can
They're lost in a moment and fading away in the night



I'll always carry you inside my heart and you
You'll never know how much I wonder where you are
I always knew that you would take a part of me away with you
And I never got to say good-bye

And I never...ever...said good-bye


That night is just a memory
But I still feel you standing next to me
And when I think I hear your voice all I hear is the rain...

I'm hypnotised and helpless
Beneath the pale full moon
My body is your sacrifice
You spirit's coming soon

I stare up at a squalid night
It's been so cold and smooth
Turns tender kisses into bites
As you begin to move


You look so weak and fragile
You seem to drip and sway
But you swept me up into your arms
And carried me away


I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's coming true


You led me to temptation
Delivered me to pain
I walked upon your hallowed ground
My soul is yours to gain


Your passion drains my energy
Fear starts running deep
I'm falling in slow motion
Into eternal sleep


I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's coming true

Fear starts running deep
Falling in slow motion

"Your love is colder than a foggy river
Rollin on a heart of stone
You left me stranded on this foggy river
Cold and helpless and alone

I knew someday that you would turn me down
I got worries on my mind
Yes I'm doomed to sail this foggy river
Till I leave my love behind

There's no tomorrow on this foggy river
Only memories linger on
A mist of sorrows fills this foggy river
Everything I had is gone

I can't escape this broken heart of mine
I've no freedom anymore
Heaven help me on this foggy river
Till I reach that distant shore

I understand what it means to have taken a life
I don't think I can handle this

All is lost!
Everything that I've known is gone

Cause I've wasted all my life
Giving to the sin when I had a mind

On my hands 
Why do I feel so comfortable?
What's happening to me?

As a perfect disguise

But she never knew the price

Could craze the town
An emperor’s clothes
Never be exposed

Spent, so spent
Railing against undeserved

Dangling precipitants
Raining down idiots
Always flapping in the
Flapping in the wind

Could have been belligerent
Could have been half percent
Could have been wanting

The sunny afternoon
Into oblivion

Of someone, someone somehow knew all about
And all the young girls turned up late and drank us all to some kind of stand still
With looks of ""Heard it all before""
And distant ideas of death and thrills
And in absence, asked the host if he had any left
And somehow I did feel like yesterday was ours
But it's gone
Yesterday was ours
All along
And they were singing

We walked the fairground parking lot
And with our secret handshakes
Sealed the deal completely
But I'm too close to know just what
Will keep Pandora's boxes shut
And so I'll fail you badly
When you really need me

'Cause I don't know
What I should know –
That I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore

I'll get a pen and make a list
And give you my analysis

With a happy ending
Was I the bullet or the gun
Or just a target drawn upon
A wall that you decided
Wasn't worth defending?

Staring down the throat of the screaming abyss
Surrendering is half the battle

In some places it comes in thirty-two flavors

From the President down to Long Tall Sally
Can't live with it but
You'll die without it - yes you would

You call 911 but you
Can't stop the fun tonight, it's alright


You can't start a fire without a spark
But there's something that I guarantee
You can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease


Where you look you can find it
Try to run but you're always behind it
So you play hide and seek like a blind kid
Until you're caught - yeah you're caught
So you'll say that you had some
But they took it and held it for ransom
Were they tall, dark, skinny or
Handsome - you won't talk
So you telephone your doctor
Just to see what pill to take
You know there's no prescription
Going to wipe this one away

Now you know for sure, you know the cure

""We have one collective hope: the Earth; and yet, uncounted people remain hopeless
Famine and calamity abound
Sufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war
People kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s concept of God

Do we admit that our thoughts and behaviors spring from a belief that the world revolves around us?
Each fabricated conflict, self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane
Every fictionalized dictator, biased or partisan, and wayward son
Are part of the curtains of society’s racial, ethnic, religious, national and cultural conflicts
And you find the human ego turning the knobs and pulling the levers

When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets and planets
Each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity
I see beyond the plight of humans
I see a Universe ever-expanding, with its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching four-dimensional fabric of space and time

However big our world is, our hearts, our minds, our outsize atlases, the universe is even bigger
There are more stars in the Universe than grains of sand on the world’s beaches
More stars in the Universe than seconds of time that have passed since Earth formed
More stars than words and sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived

The day we cease the exploration of the cosmos is the day we threaten the continuing of our species
In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their low-contracted prejudices, and would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment
Until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective: a perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above, nor below; but within""

Is calling out to us tonight
I won't work for my old man
Anymore that you fit into your mammas plan
There's a place for people like you and me
True love's still got room to breathe


And we can drive all night
Into the morning light
Let's go west
It's our ticket out of here
Yeah we can disappear
Let's go west
And that painted sky was made for us
It's everything we ever dreamed of
Let's go west


It's hard to leave this place behind
Got memories turning in my mind
Little white house with a picket fence
That protected small town innocence
But it seems like an even trade to me
That security for our destiny


Yeah we can drive all night
Till the morning light
Let's go west
A place that we can go
Where the tall dreams grow
Let's go west
And we'll find a place to call our own
There's somewhere out there we belong
Let's go west


And that painted sky was made for us
It's everything we ever dreamed of




Yeah let's go west
Oh let's go west
Oh let's go west
Yeah let's go west

"It's four o'clock, and the bells are ringing
The sun is in the sky
I hear the song that the breeze is bringing
I smile and close my eyes

Slowly drifting deeper and deeper inside
I hear your voice whispering softly
We're leaving the world outside

Just hold my hand and we'll go skyscraping
So high, you and I
If your mama asks you, say we're just escaping
We're gonna be sky high

Time flies, but I don't know where it's going
You vanish in the haze
Sometimes I wish that life could be everlasting
These are our Polaroid days

Slowly melting, the sun slips from the sky
I see your face, but it's fading quickly
We're leaving the world behind

Just hold my hand and we'll go skyscraping
So high, you and I
If your mama asks you, say we're just escaping
We're gonna be sky high



We're gonna be sky high
You and me, so high
It's gonna be all right

Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby


And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know his last name
Woo!


We left the club, right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?


And I don't even know his last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!


Today, I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem


I don't even know my last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no! What have I done?""
And I don't even know my last name


What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well, it turned into, ""Oh no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know my last name
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, oh


It started off, ""Hey cutie, where you from?""

"Riding up their faces down
Bright young things wade through town
Starved souls come to life
With pursed up lips and startrucked smiles
See the creature on the prowl
Pushing through the sea-foam crow
Bedridden femme fatales
Lining up to follow them around

I have caught this city
It won't me go

Archives of wasted times
In hazy states and drunken minds
Hung beauty on the walls
Who risk the world to bare it all
Gloss writers stuck for say
Ask why it has to be that way
Star at their nascent lines
And wonder why they lack for rhyme

Our sick generation
Is our festival

Stop to watch the sun sink down
Beneath a line of manmade clouds
Rode through the flood zone mire
With broken lights and one good tire
Raced up the temple hill
Took a blessing for a cheap thrill
Disposed it for a laugh
Post it to a facebook photograph

And I love this city
It's a spectacle
A laugh a minute

Raised to avoid the lie
Never learning how or why
Taught to defend that right
But never knowing what to fight
The scholling we'd froget
Chained is to a world of debt
Waste paint on what we feel
Without the art to make it real

But we love this city
We won't let it go
And we are this city

I watched the sun sink down
Beneath the line of manmade clouds
I watched the undead rise
And walk the streets in search of life
I've seen you back away
Talking to yourself for days
I've seen you sifting through
A trumpet up list of what life did to you

And I thought you'd make it
But you let go
Let yourself go crazy

You can't break me never made me, busta soft ass beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Delores Tucker sue me I won't stop
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies, tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites whistlin' Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? , can they stop me? 
Tryna sell 4 million copies 
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we comin' from
Life as an Outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop


Don't you stop it 
Don't you stop
Stop the music 
Nooooo


Don't you stop it 
Don't you stop
Stop the music

Don't you stop it

You don't really wanna stop - stop
The only thing that we got
I bang knott's, so how much you plot
On these youngsters, millions of 'em that's lovin' everything we say
Cause at this every single day yeah
Some of us is trippin' on it 
But in turn busta's slippin' on it
So get up on it, don't be an opponent
Cause this is feedin' my family, take it away
And see me in every single place you plan to be
Don't stop


I got 58 ways to get out of the game
But only one way's gonna fit my name; Hussein
Ride by, with the block, I can't stop
Not even for the cop's will, I close down shop
Yo, I broke nights to get big, gettin' rope spot's hold it tight

Runnin' with fat blunts niggas ain't rollin' right
Temp this
I bitch this track, I love rap 
Senseless, relentless in every sentence but above that
Brain driller, fuckin' Fatal's a walkin' pain killer

Insane iller than caine, Uzi cops, then watch 'em fear ya
Who's next?
I'm ready to check a neck in a second

Gripin' the TEC and slap' ya head because I snap under pressure
Cuttin' circulation
Stranded on the plant the earth's chasin'
Scared of probation now I'm facin' death tryna hurt a nation
Burn like acid

Wake up Beckie, I've got something to say
Listen to me, let's try this one more day
I know it's late now, but you know I just can't sleep
Wake up Becki, won't you talk with me


Wake up Becki oh now listen to me please
Understand now, I'm down on my knees
You gotta believe me when I say my love is true
Wake up Becki, all I want is you

And this is what I'd say to you if you'd pick up that phone
You must be fast asleep not thinking about me or you're already gone
Wake up Beckie, Beckie I'm almost home




Wake up Beckie oh I know it's been too long
Since I've held you, and I know you've been strong
Don't you worry, I may be gone for a week or two

"I had a routine
I wonder what I'll do today
I've got a feeling
I'll be doing the same things all over again
Again

So here, here I came
To present myself a newer hell
Face, body, and mouth
Place the mirror to me
In every episode, well

Bring all the spaces together
And all the silences ever
Bring all the spaces together

Come close again
Be my pause before the end
I miss you, oh, like a fading dream
And I have a feeling you know what I mean

Looking at pictures
The taste, the smell
Not the friends

And in our old kitchen
Record player never ends
They were once
But now no more
You know that it's real
And they were before
Nothing said and silence gained
And my body grows but heart lays

Blink hard and set it to ink
These items fade faster than you think
Feelin' low in a major key
Do they remember me now that it's one year A.D?

Bring all the spaces together
And all the silences ever
Bring all the spaces together

Build all the silences up

Things have been getting pretty rough around here
No coffee cups flying 'round the room
Just daggers born from tears
Let’s try to crawl out from under our breath
We can never break up, so I love you to death
The man I'd become was so comfortably dumb
I believe you could mean it, but you’re not having fun
And I’m sorry


I learned to breathe I guess some time ago
But just recently I learned what it means to take it slow
I’m lousy with excuses and you know I love to swear
So goddamnit, I swear to whatever’s out there
And I love you more now than I ever have, so


Let’s pick another day to call it quits and walk away
Let’s find some other time to break down
The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the darkness, and I will too
You might leave me still, but not today
For now, can we just stay?
Can we just stay?


You would think by now that I’d be fine
Y'know, like really stretching out
But it would all be lies
I'm no longer in control of my own shoes
There they go
Quickly running out of booze
Drinking to kill myself to live without you
Over there, where I’m still scared
Sometimes


Let’s pick another day to call it quits and walk away

The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the darkness, and I will too

"A long time has come and gone
I've seen more than I should
You know I've seen it all
There's never been lack
For the marks on my back
Said a long time has come and gone
My hope is God for tomorrow
No more tears
Say goodbye to sorrow
In the middle of the desert
Said He would spring forth a well
My hope is in God for tomorrow

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Once I was lost
But now I'm found
God shed His grace on me

I don't want to cry no more
I pour out my heart
Now I'm walking out the door
I don't want to cry no more

Somebody's got to help me please
For more than twenty years
My eyes been filled with tears
A long time has come and gone
You don't know me well
There are surprises that I keep
I could never tell
You'll never know
A long time has come and gone
Seen more than I should
You know, I've seen it all
Never been lack for the marks on my back

You've been my golden best friend
Now with post-demise at hand
Can't go to you for consolation
Cause we're off limits during this transition


This grief overwhelms me
It burns in my stomach
And I can't stop bumping into things


I thought we'd be simple together
I thought we'd be happy together
Thought we'd be limitless together
I thought we'd be precious together
But I was sadly mistaken


You've been my soulmate and then some
I remembered you the moment I met you
With you, I knew God's face was handsome
With you, I saw fun and an expansion


This loss is numbing me
It pierces my chest
And I can't stop dropping everything


I thought we'd be sexy together
Thought we'd be evolving together
I thought we'd have children together
I thought we'd be family together
But I was sadly mistaken


If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
My wealth would render this no less severe


I thought we'd be genius together
I thought we'd be healing together
I thought we'd be growing together
Thought we'd be adventurous together

"La camera 21
Le tende bianche e blu
La stessa cameriera
Con un anno in più
Un rubinetto perde
Mi dice lei di là
Ma dire che lo so
Come si fà

Ci penso a tutto io
Mi aveva detto lei
Dormiamo lì
Mangiamo poi dai miei
Ed era così mia moglie
Che la scoprivo allora
Con tutte le sue voglie
Di conquistarmi ancora
Ed io...ed io... ed io...

Pensavo a quella notte
Con l'altra proprio lì
Che bello il temporale
Quando si ècosì
Pensavo giù al portiere
Che fosse furbo un pò
E che non mi chiedesse
Come sto

Che bella che èmia moglie
E la scappavo via
È meglio di quell'altra
E poi è mia
E poi capisce e penso
Io a niente e più a nessuno
Adesso si che ha un senso

E poi... noi...noi...

I've seen through terrorists' eyes
Sometimes I feel no emotion
Sometimes I break down and cry
I need to walk on a wire
I need a layer of skin
I need a preacher breathing fire
To burn away my sins
And I can't help the victims
On the side of the road
And I can't stop the cyclone
That's about to explode

Watching all the clouds roll by

We need stacks of weapons to survive
Marching for religious reasons
Marching on and on to save our lives

How can we live in harmony?

Take me far way and set my spirit higher
Take me far away and set my soul on fire
And I pretend to understand
Whatever comes I will be there for you


Genetically influenced is our harvest
How far can we go?
Someday my own clone will come
Takes away my wife, how could I know?

Sometimes I could just go insane
But when I see your smile it makes me strong again

A vision that turns to stone

But I got lucky, I got into rehab program down der in Redstone Arsenal down der in Alabama and with dem people helpin' me. Well that smoking white devil is no longer a part of my life.  I can proudly say, that white devil is no longer a part of my life and I can proudly say, that today, I do not freebase cocaine

Now I'll take a drink, now. I will take a drink but I do not freebase cocaine. You know, well, I take a drink and I might even smoke a little reefer. You know, you know I like to smoke reefer. You know, it relaxes me and everything. A couple doobies, you know, just ta get you through the day and everything. But, far as basin goes, I don't do it

Now I'll do some toot now. Don't get me wrong. I will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything, and somebody comes up and gives it to you, its impolite not to take it there. So me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you. We do party. You know, I will do some toot.

I got this little letter I'm tryin to break it down
But let me tell you corey backround
He started off crazy party's full of shawtys
Religious ceremonies where people was gettin naughty
But all that changed the truth of God reign
The Gospel spread within em like viruses in his veins
But mayne even though his heart rearranged
He found himself caught up in some of his old ways
He layin up with women and sinnin was gettin strange
Thought the more he sinned the more Jesus was pleased to saved
He thought cause he accepted his brother touching his mother
That he was spiritual cause he let 'em get with each other
And corey had beef with another in the face instead of workin through it
Then opened a court case a slap to the face in the God who gives grace
Now corey's outta place tryin to carry his own weight




Now corey got married but everywhere he turned he sees lust burn
And women waitin to serve em yea and corey's learned
That Satan wishes to turn em away from his wife to satisfy all his yearnins, Divorce ain't legitimate these folk are degenerate
What God put together let nobody put a spin in it
See that ain't the end of it, he sought his own benefit
He would do the things that his friends saw as forbidden
And Dog you ain't no sin in it
His homies they were ignorant
They were made weak cos his liberty was the hinderence
Unlike an apostle, no concern for the gospel
No denying his rights
Now homie wasn't that thoughtful

You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later in the front porch light, taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn’t told you yet, but I thought I loved you then


And now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world
And I just can’t believe... the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been
We’ve come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then


And I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around, but I didn’t care, I got down on one knee right there
And once again, I thought I loved you then


But now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world
I just can’t believe... the way I feel about you girl

I'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue, it's violent rain
And in my world, the people on the street don't know my name
In my world, I'm seven feet tall
And the boys always call, and the girls do too
Because in my world, I'm constantly, constantly havin' a breakthrough 
Or a breakdown, or a blackout
Would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?


'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone 
I don't need anyone 
I just need everyone and then some 


Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
And can you feel it too, when I am touchin' you?
And when my hair stands on ends, it's saluting you
The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
And the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
Left my shoes in the street so you'd carry me
Through a breakdown
Through a breakdown or a blackout
Would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine?


'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone 
I don't need anyone 
I just need everyone and then some 


My face is full of spiderwebs, all tender yellow-blue
And still with one eye open, well, all I see is you
I left my daydreams at the gate because I just can't take 'em too
Know my heart still has a suitcase, but I still can't take it through


I don't need anyone

And I woke up in the kitchen sink
With an umbrella full of holes overtop my head and
I fell asleep on the table with your picture in hand
And I woke up in the cupboard
With some scrapes on my arms and a mouthful of hell

Chains are rattling in the attic again
And the birds are building nests in the windowsill
Dust has settled over everything
And the ceiling fan still cuts a lazy circle

I got a picture on the mantlepiece
Of the way that I thought that we'd end up
But this shares no resemblance to that
Yeah, that shares no resemblance to that at all

I tore the dreams from my head and tossed them in the flames
And the smoke smelled like my past
And it stung my eyes, but I was too stubborn to blink and
I slept inside the piano 'til the rain was gone
And I woke up when I saw the sun
And wiped the sleep from my eyes
Yeah, I knew my time had come

We're all still a part of everything that we were
And we'll all float along with everything
And in turn, we'll all fall apart with everything
But we'll learn just what things are like outside our heads

And I hear my name
And I feel you scrub my skin

To her Cheshire smile. I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted

Honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back

Reveal yourself all now to me girl while you've got the strength to speak
Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks

Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound ?

And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive
You could laugh and cry in a single sound
And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds
Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god ?
You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach
And the band they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek
They ragged, jagged melody she still clings to me like a leech

But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way
Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar
Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore
So you, left to find a better reason than the one we were living for
And it's not that nursery mouth I came back for
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor
Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores
And you should know that's true...

So what's up, hold up
Tech, I'm sorry for the hold-up but I been on the road
Should have had this verse to your ass a long time ago
When I put that on everything, I ain't had a minute to myself
But I been living like I ain't finna see tomorrow
I ain't focused on no wealth
I been living good, I been feeling fine
Pass the sriracha, I put that shit on all of mine
Busting like Columbine combined with a terrorist's mind
That's been confined to four walls for some time


They say I'm the best at what I do
After me it's 5, 4, 3, and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin'
So I tell them all to put that on somethin'
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything


Sriracha, the flavor popper
We gotcha, even haters jock us
These choppers invade the knockers then blocker
Disintegrating every chakra, eager to off ya
You can bet that we doin' it proper
When I put the bullets in a fully with a hoodie
Ain't nobody gon' stop us, nobody gon' top us
We leave 'em with no option, and leave 'em with no conscience
Even though I can achieve it no problem
And even though I could've seen what they watchin'
TV with a DVD, I can repeat what I see, these streets jockin'
Easy, if it need be then I just eat beats
Like I'm Eazy-E, Compton, I eat meat like I'm EBT shopping
Credit Card max, bend the bars back
Fuck your hoe, get brain and all that
Run in your house and bring your whore back
Sever your face and dead the doormat
Who got the keys to the rented Corvette?
Can't catch me, I'm the man in all black
I been on that shit since Katt been on crack
Fuck that, I been nice way before that
Can't ignore that, you can try though
But you gon' end up next to Dido
I'm that pen that wrote the Bible
I'm on your skin like vitiligo
Sing for the moment, I hit the high note
Someone please let Elton John know
Tell the lieutenant I'm Hect Camacho
With a Catholic priest and the Pentecostal
Why y'all niggas wiggidy wiggidy wack, get a nigga in the back
With an umbilical patch, jump in the middle of the track
None of you niggas can act so y'all niggas are packed
Come and get it again, fuckin' a bitch in the whip
Give me your moment to fall, I'm gonna fit in the car
I can do better than yours, I can be ready to brawl
I can be shattered and all, nobody want to be hard
Better be ready for war, tell me who ready for more 


They say I'm the best at what I do
After me it's 5, 4, 3, and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin'
So I tell them all to put that on somethin'

Seems like it's been dark since
The devil knows when

Tired of blowin'
Maybe soon it all will be over, amen

"When things are outta whack and they might collapse
And at the end of the day you still can’t relax
And physically you ache like a cavity feelin’ the bind
On your mind and the rest of your body
Listen to your heartbeat flow and imagine
Become Jackson Pollack air brush Chinese dragons
On a sky blue conversion van or an electra
Buick of the mind full of luminous matter
And slowly all the pressure recedes and you stop to decay
Naturally think clearly ultimately though your grace
Will give way to traffic jams
Submachine guns in hand
City red-necks who think like the omega man
Feelin’ the extremes of the times we’re livin’
Stockpile spaghetti-o’s and cheerios
Plannin’ to survive that fall-out shit

A loud noise the kind of which I’ve never heard before
I scan the dial for more stations but all I get
Is an eerie feelin’ I’m not dreaming’ this is the real dealin
There’s nothin like this trance I’m caught in a daze
Cuz I’m finally out of my body the blue lights are ablaze
Yeah I’m really amazed and feelin’ so light that’s right
Lift off and I’m into the sky
As if a hologram were created to shift my consciousness
Changed again and I’m flung in the rift
I wanna be free I wanna do right
I move through the portal to be purified

An easy way to lose it all
Always there when all else fails

Something that'll treat me okay

And he thinks he'll win you with his angry kiss

I fucked a few hoes that I met on the internet
They tried to impress me with the Gucci shoes
Bitch I ain't really into that
Hotel room start to look like a runway
Save no hoe Friday, fuck a Sunday

Four white hoes in the back of the Humvee
Knives to the back all these hoes wanna cut me
All girls are the same, pretty hoes still ugly
No good for me, no good for me
In the last three weeks, I've been to three cities tryna find these freaks, I know
It's wrong and heartbreak is real, but so are the pills
So I cannot feel whole
No good for me, no good for me

Clothes brand new, you ain't seen them before

Nothing could be half so compelling
As you and me, our senses telling us where to go
You give me quite a show
We’re stretched out horizontal throttle down
Upon the ground and always taking it slow
Here we go

I taste the salt on your skin and then it’s really beginning

Midnight in Montgomery, Silver Eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down


And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there?


'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there


Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry


'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there


Yeah, he's always singing there
Oh, Hank's always singing there

Wake up nine... maybe ten...
Depending how my head is feeling
Every step... that I take... is rattling the ceiling
Take a breath, brush my teeth
Smell like death even bleach can’t erase the taste of last night
I got holes in my clothes, someone’s sweatshirt
Who knows what I did?


When you came over
I shoulda stayed sober
And then I got the cold shoulder
Now you know you’re the reason every time I feel hungover
To be hungover
To be hungover
To be hungover
To be hungover


Please don’t call... please don’t text...
'Cause my phone is dead anyways
Shut the shades... close the door...
And I’ll see you in a couple days
Did we kiss, did we fight?
There’s a bit of the night that I might not remember
There’s a burn on my coat
Cigarettes on my throat
I don’t know what we did


When you came over
I shoulda stayed sober
And then I got the cold shoulder
Now you know you’re the reason every time I feel hungover
To be hungover
To be hungover
To be hungover

Now my wallet is gone
Five missed calls on my phone
Now my exes all know that I’m lonely
Woke up with a tattoo
It looks bad, but that’s cool
'Cause it reminds me of the shit that we did

I shoulda stayed sober

She call me daddy, she ain't never had a father but I'm cool with her mother
She gon' have a baby when we fucking, we don't never use a rubber


We gon' take our time and do it right, do it right
Take off your panties, leave 'em right here

Pussy so wet, squirting on a nigga she done gave me a shower
Then I put it all in, all in and she get a little louder, oh

She gotta go to work in the morning, so tonight is our free time

All I need is for you to say one word and that's ""Yes""
We go anywhere you wanna go
Making love in Italy all way to Monaco
Looking at the water when we pull up to the coast
And a candlelight dinner, celebrate and make a toast
Then it's to the bed, you just tell me when to go
Doing all that freaky shit that's for grown folks
Kissing on that pussy, know you need a little more
All my heart and all my love


We gon' take our time and do it right, do it right

Just like a motion picture, gunfire froze a nigga
Compose the liquor, caused me to stager, stumble over quicker
Duckin' low, with the .44, tryin' to bust and blow
Empty out before the Po Po come bust the show
Sobered up, knew it was beef, but over what?
Been in the cut, escapin' these streets, they cold as fuck
Tuck my chain in, rose to my feet, no time for aimin'
Back arched, all you saw was sparks, niggas blazin'
One fell, callin' for help, heard him yell
My last shell, tore through his spine, it's time to bail
It's slow motion, dust in my clothes started ?boatin'?
It's bizarre copin', my blood flowin' like the Arctic Ocean
Thoughts racin', hit the corner slow pacin'
No destination, it's up North a nigga facin'


If we all gonna die, I'm prepared to meet my maker
But before I touch that death bed feel, I gotta see some paper
Keep my head to the sky, won't let no one pull us down
Do whatever it takes, cause that's the breaks
Money make this world go 'round


I pleed innocent, the love for my freedom is infinite
Thoughts was intimate, I mastered the minds, the mortal ten percent
Self Defense, incarceration couldn't help repent
Caught in commotion at the time I felt it, felt intense
Him or me, it's misery through my memory
But mentally, outcome wise I feel no sympathy
You know the streets, how some niggas could go for weeks
Rock you slow to sleep, play you for doe, now you know it's beef
Know it's deep, I live my life on the creep
Tinted Jeeps, bulletproof coupes move Mystique


Let him speak, my dogg is innocent
It was my Gats, this cat named Roberto it's certain
Desert Ease in my skirts end
Let my nigga live, while I breed us up a kid
Face this little bi - tch


No explanation, speedy trial, fuck the extra waitin'
Hesitatin', they know the time a nigga facin'
So what's the verdict




I feel ill inside, though my life is still a ride
Some may criticize, but it's a blessin', that I'm still alive
From all the smoke lit, all the hoes hit, all the cold shit
From comin' that close gettin' my dome split
Spreaded out, so much on my mind, gotta let it out
To live, and die for a cause I feel dead with out
Check my rap sheet, no prior cases, just some tax beef
Charged with drunk drivin' once, but I was half 'sleep
Swervin', off of St. Mark's and Burgan, in a rented Suburban
I must've dozed when I was turnin'
But peep this, I'm on trial now, no sign of weakness
No secrets, just goin' to court, & I'm tryin' to beat this
A new Don, another score, another new born, been too long
Here's a dick jury for y'all to chew on

"Somebody broke into my heart today
He tried to steal all your love away
They couldn’t pull it off ‘cause you walked in
And rescued my love again
Oh baby come on home to your man
Baby come on home to your man

The first time I knew I loved you more
Was seeing you busting through that door
I didn’t know it, but I know it now
I couldn’t leave you baby, anyhow
Oh girl, come on home to your man
Baby come on home to your man

Somebody broke into my heart today
And tried to steal all your love away
They couldn’t pull it off ‘cause you walked in

Oh baby oh, come on home to your man

I knew I should have savored every moment
I wish I would have grabbed it tight and just held it
And I know, I know everything's wrong
I let go, let go, and now I'm gone


When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know, you know
You can't get out


I knew I should have cherished every second
I step back, I step back into another perspective
And in my mind, my mind I know I've been wrong
It's a feeling you get, a feeling so cold


When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out


I don't want to feel like this will never be over
And I don't want to sit and think about what's going wrong
And I don't want to feel like this will never be over
'Cause it feels like I've been falling for so damn long


When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out
When it all falls down
And you know, you know
You can get out



Will never be over

Will never be over
I don't want to feel like this will never be over

Loose Lucy is my delight
She come running and we ball all night


Round and round
And round and round
And round
Don't take much to get me on the ground


She's my yo-yo, I'm her string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing


Yeh-yeh
Yeh, singing, ""Thank you, for a real good time!""


I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned out all my lights




Loose Lucy, she was sore
Says I know you don't want my love no more




Be-bop baby how can this be?
I know you been out and cheating on me




Cross my heart and hope to die
I was just hanging out with the other guys




Went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love you till the day I die




I like your smile but I ain't your type
Don't shake the tree when its fruit ain't ripe

Everybody’s got their heads bowed down
The sun don’t shine above the ground

He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town


Oxford Town around the bend
Come in to the door, he couldn’t get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my friend?

My love dreams can never come true
I'll just pretend that I'm happy
And smile thru these tears dear at you

I dreamed of a cabin of love dear
Where all of our dreams would come true
But another has taken my cabin
And left me so lonely and blue

Nestled around my cabin
That means all the world to me
Our love sweet heart will always linger
For you are a part dear of me

Where is the love we once cherished
Why didn't our love dreams come true

Of a cabin sweetheart dear and you

Our devotion to our appetites betrayed us all

Mother Earth will show her darker side and take her toll

A safe, predestinated course
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising force
My strongholds broke down all too easily
I remember well
How it did embarrass me
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style

He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home
In my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that
As though he only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned


And once again
The river's flowing slowly
Following its safe and uneventful course
Now the tears have dried
It's become a pleasant break
I recall without remorse
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit
He had something that I miss
I guess he was a rolling stone
The only one I've known

Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well we, didn't want you, anyway
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la


Daddy is an agrophile in Texas
Mommy's on the bar most every night
Little Betty's sleeping in the graveyard
Living there in burgundy and white


Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well we, didn't love you, anyway
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la


Goodbye, Little Betty
Goodbye, Little Betty
So long, Little Betty
So long, Little Betty
Betty, so long


Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well we, didn't need you, anyway

"As Long As We're Together
It's what you want*
It's your amphetamine
Another night you're settling
For comfort in your bed
The more you fill
The more you're empty
You're never what you should be
Here is why you're sad
You're miserable
When he is close
So take another drink
Another drink will numb those senses
And make the most
Of flesh and bones
If it helps you
Fall asleep
I'm watching you change
It doesn't have to be this way
It gets harder everyday
So you keep numb to feel safe
Fuck what you know
Can't you see its shallow?
Every time you swallow-
Do you get a taste of what you've become?
Regrets, they wake you in the morning
You shower but you're not clean
Please just listen
I still remember the days
When you didn't feel the need to escape
And every demon you never face
Is the reason you're not safe
Please understand that you've had every chance
You've had all the time
All the time in the world
You don't listen

Are you hanging on my words tonight?
Don't you get it? Don't you get it?
Hold your breath and everything's just fine
Don't you get it?

Forgotten we can be alone if we waste away, waste away
If there's a love that brings us home, and drowns away


We smile, we grind our teeth away
Good luck forgot to call our names
Good God

Lucky us 


No one's hanging on our words tonight
Don't you get it? Don't you get it?
You can try, but you won't change their minds
Don't forget it


Burned in the sun
Afraid of what you've become
You'll pay the price when you burn, you'll see
Tell me who you want to be
Tell me what you want to see


We smile, we grind our teeth away
Good luck forgot to call our names
Good God

Tortured, but no one leads the way
Force-fed like rats inside a maze
Good God

Lucky us 


Are you hanging on my words tonight?

"If you give a cowboy a horse and a stretch of fence
You can bet the farm he'll ride all day til the whole damn thing is fixed
He'll come dragging back around along about supper time

If you give a cowboy a truck on a friday night
He'll bore a hundred dollar bill from the coffee can
Spray the mud off of them tires, drop twenty dollars in the tank, save the rest for beer

So all you girls in here need to know this

If you give a cowboy a kiss he'll want more
He's gonna want to give you a twist out on that hardwood floor
If you let him, girl if you let him
He's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is, if you give a cowboy a kiss

If you tell a cowboy he can't he'll prove he can
Cause there really ain't nothing much that he can't do with his two hands
He can fight his way out of corners, or he can softly lay you down
There ain't no time like now to find out

If you give a cowboy a kiss he'll want more
He's gonna want to give you a twist out on that hardwood floor
If you let him, girl if you let him
He's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is
If you give a cowboy a kiss

Hear the ocean wind, it'll take the shore
If you take a chance on love tonight here's what's in store
If you give a cowboy a kiss
If you give a cowboy a kiss he's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is
If you give a cowboy a kiss
If you give a cowboy a kiss

Psycho female blowing up the phone line
You need to tighten that screw it's been loose for a long time
I've been slammed with some bad luck
Soon I'm gonna bring you doom with the buck, buck
And now you duck, duck, goose, I'm letting loose
With the 30-ought freestyle labeled hostile by my profile
Must be all the madness you and all your tactics
Jonesing for my cash got to make them pockets super fat
Hey I'm a humble man kicking out my jams like a tramp
I'm gonna stick it like a stamp to this business
What's with all the business?
I get paid to take the microphone and slay the stage
Stay away from all the bros in my band and all the fans
And all my friends when the cash is coming in
Or I'll be slamming them balls to the wall
With the ink on my flesh to the 'yes, yes y'all!'
No 9 to 5, I'll still survive
I keep my engine on that amp like a Chattanooga champ
That's all we need, another bad seed
Planted on this Earth motivated by greed


You wanna play that game bitch?
You take a dash for my cash it's your ass that I'm blasting!
Boy, you wanna play that game bitch?
You take a dash for my cash it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so... stuck!
Stuck, deep down in that hole again!
Stuck, got your brain on my green again!
Stuck, you're so, you're so, you're so stuck you don't even know!


All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi
Far from suicidal still I get them tendencies
Bringing back them memories
That I really miss when I reminisce
Rocking back in the 80s live my attitude to do or die
Once I was a maggot but now I'm just Super Fly
Bound for the boundaries, no limit G
Fat ass rhythms driven by my destiny
Your style's in my pocket
Proclaimed to regain that essence
Pressin 'cause I'm hostile labeled by my profile
Indeed I am, I am indeed hostile when it comes to greed


You wanna play that game bitch?
You take a dash for my cash it's that ass that I'm blasting!
Boy, you wanna play that game bitch?
You take a dash for my cash it's your ass that I'm blasting

Aw yeah, ain't nothin' like a greedy bitch
Digging, digging, digging, digging, digging so deep for that green
All I know, all I know, that you must be fucked up in the head
I got a little problem, just one question, biatch
Why, why you wanna be like that?
Why, why you gotta be like that?

That's when I rise, that's when I crawl
Gliding on mist, hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss, evils abound


In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites


Into your room, where in deep sleep
There you lie still, to you I creep
Then I descend close to your lips
Across you I bend, you smile as I sip
Now you are mine, in my control
One taste of your life and I own your soul
Softly you stir, gently you moan
Lust's in the air, wake as I groan


In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night

Invites you, invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you, delights you
It drains you to white

That with my first bite there'd be no turning back
So come in my arms, I strike any hour
I will return to trap and devour

Rule number two: Give respect where respect due
Rule number three: If you get knocked, play games and say names

It's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fucking thing
For me ain't nothin' changed, but the things my money brings
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
You peoples got plenty money actin like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin' chopped on chow lines
An old timer schooled me, said: ""Don't burn bridges, my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo' ass gotta swim""
I watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk in New York
Me and shorty stood from a far and had a talk
He said ""I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin' he had a lot of nerve""

Hardcore niggas start actin' feminine
With the Feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke, you get ten, you'll damn near do nine

A thief is only after my salary, a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya' cheese
Try to see three hundred G's before you see 300Z's
Tree top to feel the breeze, coke connect for key's
Yo' bitches sexin' me, take me to ecstacy
Once I nut, I don't want 'em next to me
If it's on, mother fucker, believe I'mma ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood before I swallow my pride

I bet I grab a 4-pound and back that ass down

Many men get drunk, puff lye and stay high
Here's a jewel: love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same, friends always change
I learned quick that there's more than one way to skin a cat
You can get 'em in the face, dog, or down his back
All bullshit aside now, its time to be honest
I fear no man, for death is all that's promised
I got niggas standin' in line waitin' to hear me spit
From '86 to '96 the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin' to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Ain't nothin' changed in the game, but faces and names

I cannot leave this undecided
Stepping down to battle another day

Remember me for all time
This determination is a vital part of me
Surrender now, or be counted
With the endless masses that I will defeat


Come on bring it, don't sing it

Broken down, 'til your hope has died
Beat down, 'til the victory is mine
Stand up and show me some pride
And now, are you ready?

Into a battlefield, tonight

As I look upon you
Through the warriors eyes, now

Ensure my victory, this time

They'll never doubt the body lying at my feet
A most formidable reminder
They will speak my name for eternity

I have no need of any guidance
I am a weapon, powerful beyond belief
Seen through the warriors eyes
I never need to question how to defeat you

Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away


Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own


There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day


Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world

And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

There's nothing to hold you but the flames

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul


Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, woah


Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go


I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong


Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, woah


Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?

One, two
To a nigga nature
Hehe


No need to cry now, go wipe your tears
Be a woman, why you actin' surprised?
You showed the bullshit; commin' fake hair
Fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Ain't nothin' hard about it
Why you lookin' sad, should'a though about it
Say you learn, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla ""Dom Pérignon""
Knowin' I'm a cash dealer, still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me
Plus you was smilin' 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for trynna dick me
Missed me with that ""buy me this, buy me that""- syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad 'cuz I cursed and I screamed I hate ya
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me


Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way


Probably too nice at first
I lettin' you kiss where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slangin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, toungkissin', you was truly with it
Little Ecstasy, Hennessey, mix with me
Picture me pray for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' at the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the room, call the cops
Nigga, hit them walls til the bastard drop
Label me: Makaveli - Thug Nigga with pipe
Livin' life as a Rock Star friday nights
Make money, get pussy
Always keep a pager, cell-phone in the ride
To complete my Nature now!


Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way


Started as a seed from the semen
Straight outta Papa's nuts, lustin' for creamin'
Bitches wit big butts, curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno fleeks
Sneak weed in, helped a nigga passed the time
With my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood
Follow me, I got a gun on me
Goin' for nun on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' til I die
Picture of nigga in heaven high, of weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies with the phonies that died
Hit the weed and hope it get me high
Dear God, understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart
In a realla nigga nature!


Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way
Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way

She looked up from the book she was reading
With the prettiest smile that I ever saw
Curly hair down her back
And her skin like cinnamon brown without a flaw
And man, those eyes
Made my heart stop in my chest
Then she said, ""Hi""
And it was hard to catch my breath
I said, ""Hey lil' mama
I don't mean to bother at all, my name is Chris"" 
And before she could answer
I said, ""Don't say a word
Listen to this, I think you're fine""
And she cracked that smile again
Let's say goodbye to my homies and your friends


We can dip out...
We can dip out alone, keep it moving
Do something fun, and keep it moving
Talk about life, about love, that's what's up 
Keep it moving 
Don't matter at all 
Wherever we go 
Oh 
Girl, just come on, let's keep it moving


So we exchange numbers
I told her I'll be at her crib by a quarter to six
We can go get a bite, little lady
Or chill at the mall and catch a flick
If that's alright
She said, ""As long I'm home by nine 
Whatever we do is fine""
I can't believe
I can't believe that she's here with me, no 
And God only knows
God only knows, how far we can go
I hope this night will go my way
I hope this night will go my way and we can do this everyday
And if I'm cool and take my time
Then I might just get a kiss goodnight, oh yeah


We can dip out alone, and keep it moving
Do something fun, and keep it moving 
Talk about life, about love, that's what's up 
And keep it moving 
It don't matter at all

I'm up for something that last
I ain't looking to screw on the first night

And if the vibes good, go to first base
'Cuz the first kiss could be your last taste
I ain't lookin to screw 'till the vibes right

See I'm the only one you know
That can put you on cruise control
Yea I'm the only one you'll find
That won't waste all my time, on nothin

Nothin, on nothin, nothin

My will is stronger than most
I will not let you get close
Untill I think you deserve me
Cause that's a no go
I'm gonna hold out, so in the mean time
Don't expect much from a strong mind
Untill I think you deserve me

See I'm the only one you know
That can put you on cruise control
Yea I'm the only one you'll find
That won't waste all my time

I'm holdin' out, I'm gonna wait
Wanna make it past the first date
A little time
Then we can do
All the nasty things you want to
Don't get me wrong
Just take my hand
And I really hope you understand
That it's easier when every second counts
So we'll jus have to wait

It's really no big deal
It's really no big deal

I'd hate to get you in bed
Find out your empty insted
No need to knock another homerun out
Cause thats a no go

And I'd hate to be so filthy
If we wern't meant to be
No need to knock another homerun out

See I'm the only one you know

You hear them people talking
About the man above
There's too much talking trash
And not enough love
Now I believe in rainbows
I got to make it clear
That I told everyone you know
That you were my idea

Head over heels and a we're fallin deeper
I got a feeling it's time and so maybe
I got that somethin in mind so baby


Take me to your sunny side of love

And I just can't get enough
A needle in a haystack
A diamond in the rough
Your perfect imperfections
You know you got that right
It's all that loving all day long
Keeps me up all night
No doubt about it she rhymes for no reason
We're talking love yeah the kind you know she's in
You want a kiss and you know that'choo ought to
Yeah you can't miss and you know you've got to

I got whiskey to keep me warm
When the sun goes down
And this godforsaken honky tonk
Ain't likely to run out
So won't you come on home and save me
Stop me before I drown

When you're not around
And there's women in this town
Whispering in my ear
Saying things a man
In my condition likes to hear
So won't you come on home and stop me

Further down the track

"The city streets are wet with rain tonight
Taxi drivers swerve from lane to lane
A lonely guitar man playin' down the hall
Midnight blues comin' through the walls

I tried to call you on the telephone
I left it off the hook
Just to hear it ring
You told me you were better off alone
I never knew that tears could sting

I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars
Lookin' down at all the cars
I can see you
In the window of your favorite corner bar
But to reach you is just too far
And I might as well be on Mars

The city seems so old and grey and beat
It closes in and makes me wanna suffocate
And you just live across the street
But that's a billion miles away

You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place
Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'
I'd cross the universe to be right where you are
But I'm right in your backyard
And I might as well be on Mars

"Suffocating
And what was on my chest
Out of love, out of line
Nearly out of my mind

I'm tired of waiting
Giving all my best
In a maze, in a haze
I was wasting my time

I was broken, I was scared
But now I'm coming up for air

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
And teaching me to breathe again

Lungs are burning
My walls were closing in
On the floor needing more
Than a door or window

All the hurting wars
I couldn't win
You were there in a prayer
With a glimmer of hope

I was shaken, I was sure
That I would never find the cure

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
Teaching me to breathe again

Teaching me to open up
Teaching me to care
Teaching me to take a chance
Feels like I'm almost there

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind

You came around

I can't control the butterflyz

And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life


Hurry, I'm worried


The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
I just wanna feel your lips against my skin


White sheets, bright lights, crooked teeth, and the nightlife
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldn’t let you complete me


I’m trying not to let it show, that I don’t want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutched my brain and eased my ailing


You’re writing lines about me, romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
Cause we’re something she can’t see
And I try to refrain but you’re stuck in my brain
All I do is cry and complain, because second’s not the same

Late night coolin' with my homies
Drinkin' Hennessey and cold brew
After smokin', stopped in Oakland
Got the munchies for some soul food
So we stopped to get a bite to eat
At the local barbecue
It's just another boring Monday
And there's nothing else to do
Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fighting
So I turn to look and find out
What's the cause of this excitement
One brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dopeman
And the dope man had an AK
Said he'll spray and he's not jokin'
Well it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dope man for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up getting shot up
Now I could not walk away
Cause I got caught up in the scene
Wondering what would happen to this
Poor and helpless fiend
Well my homie, Michael Cooley
Said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
Stand out here fight over quarters
While I walked inside the diner
And all the Dope Fiends waved to me
Heard the sound of several gun shots
And I ran outside to see...

All the people in the diner
Ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
For them to see just who they would know
But for me I held concern
I wanted to go see the outcome
Would the mother have her son tonight
Or would she live her life without one?
I made it to the streets I
Almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot
And my heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
But she took it in his place

I tried to make my way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak
But she whispered
Mister can you please save me
So I screamed out, someone help me
But I dont think they could hear
And if they did, they didn't care
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lie here dying
And I wondered what could I do
The camera men and newspapers had come
To get their interviews
To them it's just a story
And they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
Cause it ain't, it wasn't their family
I don't think I'll be back
Cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here
Though some people say it's crazy
And the food could have been finer
I'll never forget, never forget the night
At Dopefiend's Diner


Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do...

Triple 6 'til death



Hold up, wait
All of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
One day, I will forget their name
One day, I'll forget their name, name, name

Hold up, wait
All of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
One day, I will forget their name
One day, I'll forget their name, name, name


When I was 27, every night, I had dreams to die
Now I'm 28, feeling more dead than alive
29 in a month, all my idols fucking dead
Got a check; more or less, just another problem 
Bringin' 400 Degreez, No Limit, Cash Money
Half a milli' bands in cash, I feel like Cash Money
Popped a Xan, couldn't tell you when, I forget
Fuck a friend, all I need is $crim and my kin 
Days looking grim, goosebumps on my skin
Hope the reaper coming, hope my demise begin
Fill my veins with heroin, poking through my skin
This is the end



Hold up, wait
All of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
One day, I will forget their name
One day, I'll forget their name, name, name


One day, I'll become the same: a pile of ashes forgotten in a vase
Wrap my chain around the base, and then put it on display
Flashing lights, they shine so brightly
'Till there's blackouts every night
See shattered glass rain from the sky
Beware my drip , that shit so blinding!
White gold blade, on a bright gold chain
Ruby da Cherry been hated, so why the fuck would I not stay the same?
Every step that Ruby take is like he walking on a plank
Let the waves crash down, let them take me to my grave
Ain't no way, my gang ain't grey
Thousands of people are shouting for $uicide to save the day
Roll up in the tank, fuck the fame
Remember my name until your memory fades
Documenting the plague until my dying day


""—tens of people arrested, several ounces of a deadly drug are now off the streets of St. Tammany Parish all after several law enforcement agencies joined forces.""

When you hear that rooster crowing
In the dawn, in the dawn
There's really no way of knowing
What goes on, what goes on
The world is full of questions
Some are answered, some are not
The only faith you're keeping
Is the faith that you still got
I love the sound of laughter
And music in the air
And in the ever after
I know it's always there
A man had many boxes
And he liked them quite a lot
But they would not be opened
Because the value would be shot
Sometimes when I go walking
In the trees, in the trees
That's where I do my praying
In the trees, in the trees
The world is full of answers
Some are right, some are wrong
The one that I believe in
Is a wish in a song


I love to see you smiling
And hear your voice so fair
And in the ever after
I know you're always there

Niggas know I call my Porsche the baby elephant
You ain't talking money then you got speech impediment
Everything I got, I got from selling shit
And who I sold it to is irrelevant
Pocket full of Dead Presidents I'm good with whatever
I pull my dick out and tell her sit where ever
I done stood on the block nigga from 9 to 9
And I done sold a 9 at least 9 times
9 Milla, clientele Look Like Thriller
If my baby mama cheating I Hope God with her
You not iller I'm Godzilla on hard liquor
My Penny loafers had nickels... UGH

You know I know that white and green like a chalk board
What you doing? Just chillin look like the top board
So many chickens in the kitchen it looks like a soup
Must be some owls in this bitch, cause I keep hearing ""hoo""
This for my niggas cooking 9s like they chicken breasts
You know we trynna hide the six that's why the chickens dressed
I had the Lam Black and green like a Parakeet
No, I ain't tripping, put the pigeons in the Cherokee
Everything a nigga got, I got from slanging birds
What I ain't get from slanging blocks I got from slanging words
Snow




I got a car, that bitch a classic
White on red, inside out that bitch nasty
When I pull up on them sixes, speakers blastin
Black scale white work clear plastic
And everything I got I got from selling birds
Half a brick to do a verse, I guess I am selling words
That dubbed it up
Niggas send me dranks so they double the cup
Got two chains on, bitch I'm icey as fuck
2 brains on my arm that's a 100 and up
We sell dope it ain't nothing to us
New whip, new bitch, nigga change for what?
And where I come from niggas bang for none
Every nigga in the hood gotta stand for some
Drinkin soda bakin soda I'm yammin up
In the kitchen at the table just a gram and up
My niggas grinding we banding up
These pussies know not to be playing with us
Work


My bad bitch, my money long
Car game filthy and my game strong
The kitchen hot
My block rock
My neighborhood shot cus them cars hot
Nigga on some money shit
Got back on that other shit
Came with the fame nigga listen while you learn bitch
Money is for show shit
Gettin it while we blow this bitch
All the time we are gonna show where we are flowing bitch
100 thousand on the watch
Living lavish off top
Neighborhood watch
Cocaine flocks
The coke game strong
Overseas phone

So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""

This is the first day of my life
I swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain; suddenly, everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don’t know where I am
I don’t know where I’ve been
But I know where I want to go


And so, I thought I’d let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Mhm mhm


Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said “This is the first day of my life
I’m glad I didn’t die before I met you
But now, I don’t care; I could go anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”


So if you want to be with me

"From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No-one asks us how we'd like to be
In school they teach us what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see

So they keep talking and they never stop
At a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
Cause I decide the way things gonna be

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

There's a million ways  to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool 
In the end of it,  none of us is right
Sometimes, we need to be alone 

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave me alone

To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

No need to react now that everything's done 
I thought it would be simple enough
And I had to grow up
Just to learn all the ways that it's not

I never aimed to feel confused, I blame myself to tell the truth
But now I know that everything's hard when you're living in the dark

I never had the balls to tell you

On anybody living off of mine

I could live like this forever

Was to open my mouth and be honest
I had to go and do it, yeah

Please, don't be afraid"", she reassures me

Feel amazing and I'm on my way home

And listened for the sound
In the dry years he went under
He never got off the ground

We all dream when we're younger
That we will do great things
Me, I used to have a hunger
To wear a pilot's wings

But the circle's that I ran in
Turned my head around
And the planes I had my plans in
Never got off the ground

Don't raise your hopes
You hear so many say
The higher they get
The closer they are to flying away
Fly away..

Don't raise your hopes
You hear so many say
The higher they get
The closer they are to flying away

They say there but for fortune
Is the way it would have been
If we could take a bigger portion
We'd fill our hands again
You see them on the sidewalks
In the parks all over town
Those who've taken flight
Never got off the ground

You bought a star in the sky tonight
Because your life is dark and it needs some light
You named it after me, but I’m not yours to keep
Because you’ll never see, that the stars are free


Oh we don’t own our heavens now
We only own our hell
And if you don’t know that by now
Then you don’t know me that well


All my life I’ve been so lonely
All in the name of being holy
Still, you’d like to think you know me
You keep buyin’ stars
And you could buy up all of the stars
But it wouldn’t change who you are
You’re still living life in the dark
It’s just who you are

You bought a star in the sky tonight
And in your man-made dark
The light inside you died

You know only how to own me
You know only how to own me
You’re buying stars to shut out the light
We come alone and alone we die
And no matter how hard you try
I’ll always belong in the sky


And you could buy up all of the stars
But it wouldn’t change who you are
You’re still living life in the dark

"Take my eyes, the things I've seen
In this world coming to an end
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin
You may pass through me and
Leave no trace, I have no mortal face
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear me call

We can shed our skins and swim
Into the darkened void beyond
We will dance among the world
That orbit stars that aren't our sun
All the oxygen that trapped us
In a carbon spider's web
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear the sirens of the dead

Left the elders to their parley
Meant to satisfy our lust
Leaving Damocles still hanging
Over all their promised trust
Walk away from freedoms
Offered by their jailers in their cage
Step into the light
Star tripping over mortals in their rage

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight

The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hallowed bones
Make pacts of love, but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose

Virgins in the teeth of God
Are meat and drink to feed the damned
You may pass through me
And I will feel the life that you live less
Step into my light star tripping
We will rage against the night
Walk away from comfort
Offered by your citizens of death

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are one with the Goddess of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose
Whatever life to live or life to lose
Whatever God you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

Look into our face reflected
In the moon glow in your eyes
Remember you can choose to look
But not to see and waste your hours
You believe you have the time
But I tell you your time is short
See your past and future
All the same and it cannot be bought

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are one with the Goddess of the sun tonight

Calling all the chicas, chicas, chicas
Another round of the Magheritas, send them over 
Te digo la verdad , contigo enamorar, ya lo sé 
Mi amor, colombiana y cubana, está sola
Sí, al ritmo, fiesta, vamos a mi casa
Baila y canta hasta mañana, nunca para
She stay here to the morning
Love me, baby, let's keep them waiting
Let's go one more time, dame tu-


Culo, puta, ¿qué lo que, mami-mami?
Culo, puta, ¿qué lo que, mami-mami?
Culo, puta, ¿qué lo que, mami-mami?
Dime lo que quieres, dímelo, dale, dale

Drop dead cynical


I need attention, feed on my addiction
I want the action, satisfaction
You have to feed me words that I inquire
So my discord someday takes me higher


I hope to thrill you, let expectations rise
I want to bring you somewhere you can't compromise
I'm coming at you like a cannonball
So here's the truth; you are drop dead cynical


Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical
Drop dead cynical


It's your illusion's fatal contradiction
I need the action, premonition
I like to thrill you, I am what inspires
Let you explode in a cosmic fire


You're Diogenes, enlightened Zeno's mind
Ten times a cynic as the man behind the shine
You make it hard to justify it all
See what you are; you are drop dead cynical


Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical

Drop dead cynical

Drop dead cynical


Dr-dr-dr-drop dead cynical
Dr-dr-dr-drop dead cynical


I hope to thrill you, let expectations rise
I want to bring you somewhere you can't compromise
I'm coming at you like a cannonball
So here's the truth; you are drop dead cynical


Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical

Take another bite
It'll be alright
What's wrong will soon feel right
Dangerous tonight

Take another sip
Let it kiss your lips
And let a little drip on your thighs

If you let me I'll untie your sensuality
I'll open up your heart and satisfy my greed


I'm dangerous, I'm a dying breed
Poisonous like a centipede
I'm capable of the foulest deed
Dangerous at night
I'm dangerous like a razorback
Deadly like a heart attack
Well, I don't bend and I don't crack
Dangerous tonight


Take another turn
The rules have all been burned
And you've got tricks to learn
Dangerous tonight

Play another role
Try and lose control
And stain your soul to red from white

In my mind, oh, a million voices tell me no
It's prime crime time and I gotta let it go

I'm dangerous like a broken glass
I'm a flesh fanatic psychopath
I can cause you pain and make it last
Dangerous tonight
I'm dangerous when the sun goes down
So cross yourself, don't fool around
I'll drag your heart into the ground
Dangerous tonight

If you let me I'll untie your sensuality
I'll open up your heart and satisfy my greed



I'm dangerous like a broken glass
I'm a blood bubonic psychopath
I can cause you pain and make it last

You could charm the rattles off a rattlesnake

Ladies bring it on over

They don't stand a chance
First, you unfold them
Then you pigeon-hole 'em

Well it sure takes a lot of good-natured self control
When I'm so hot for you and you're so cold, so cold
Why do you keep on trying to make a man of me
Couldn't you just love me like you love cocaine?
Cocaine and base

Cross my heart I swear I'm not trying to trick you
No tricks
Ladies' man, ladies' man
Its' just a straight ahead feeling I have for you
Nothing slick
Ladies' man, ladies' man

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him
Just traveled about
But his dog up and died, he up and died
And after 20 years he still grieves

He said, ""I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
Because I drinks a bit""

My strength has gone
Thoughts are corrupting my mind

I can see I perceive this ain’t me

Something so strong
My mood has swung
I can’t get it out of my head

I believe that my mind misleads me

Just have an open look inside

It’s just a dreary memory stuck in your mind


Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe

Search for essence
Find the silence within you


You’re searching and bursting
There seems to be no cure
When tension endures
Delusions corrupting my mind

I can see I perceive this ain’t me

There seems to be no way
When light fades to grey
To get them all out my head

Retrieve your balance
Use your senses to observe

Search for your essence

Explore your heart

When a persistent memory
Penetrates deep in your mind
Allow the silence to destroy
Your thoughts in every kind

Just have an open look inside

It’s just a dreary memory stuck in your mind

Allow the silence
To wipe your thoughts away

And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in

And the sea will split
And the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the waves will pound
And the mornin' will be a-breakin'

The fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

And they'll raise their hands

And like Goliath, they'll be conquered

Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and ""aw shit""
Soon as I seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
Wanna ""Freak Like Me"", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, ""Can I cum inside?""
Say you don't feel it that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye when I walked by
I said, ""Hi""
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange


You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you 
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me 
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang


Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it’s a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my ""Temptations""
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it 'cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange


You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you 
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me 
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang


Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you gettin' dick!
And since you bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
You said ""take it"" so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
'Cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange


You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you 
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me 
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn
You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you 
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me 
A fair exchange, you know the game

A low crib with the wiz thats pretty
A crew crib where niggas bring biddies
A crib out mid, thats hid like Diddy's
A tropic spot out in the Caymans
A Cali spot the first time I copped




I got love for thugs and hustlers period
Hate for snakes, I take that serious
Respect for ballers and those that stack
Appreciation for broads with back
Death for losers that snitch and tell
My homie homes first day on bail




I got five albums out four to go
A paper fetish, I love the dough
Love for V's that speed and blow
Knowledge of self if you need to know
Patrone,Crissy, even Cleeko
Bitch so big I had to a pimp

Some say the end is near
Some think it’s all so hazy

If it all ends tomorrow
If it all disappears

Anywhere else but here!

Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame

I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows


I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down


Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971


I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down




If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so

I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free

I'm going deep hope I don't drown 'cause you're air, baby

Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors

You try to touch me, I pull out, you get your brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on your own

Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy

Every summer in the city start to feel like Columbine

I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still
Of every chill

Chided by the silence of the hushed sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine

Staring into blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are
Unknown we are

To the world and to the both of us
I confessed a longing I was dreaming of
Some better love


But there's no better you love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love


I have never loved a darker blue
Then the darkness I have known in you
Honed from you

You whose heart would sing in anarchy
You who'd laugh at meanings guarantees
So beautifully

When our truth is burned from history
By those who figure justice in fond memory
Witness me

Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
Or live eternally


'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love

I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses


And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known


He speaks, and the sound of his voice
Is so sweet, the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing




I'll stay in the garden with him
Though the night around me be falling
And he bids me go, through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling

But the cloud is still in the sky
Cause there's a better place to be and it's one you need to see in this lifetime
So get on board and be on your way, whoa

Space to fill
Nothing to do but chill
No one minds if you misbehave

You gotta come out on a run as we set into the sun
Blending all the flavors only mixing in the perfect one
Harmony and a beat with boom
Feeling all old school

As we zoom
See it all so clearly
There's nowhere on Earth to be
On the open sea
Best believe me

Take your frozen heartache, lay it in the island sun
Oh bake it like a snowflake, drink the water it becomes
As it melts away

Out of bounds
Seemingly lost and found
Come around
As we sail away

You gotta come along with me as we float across the sea
Mixing all the elements with alien technology
A secret message hidden in this tune
Now let me hear it from you

Tell me what you say
Who's the one that gets you?
Free from all distractions
Under a full moon
Could it be me?

Take your frozen heartache, lay it in the island sun
Oh bake it like a snowflake, drink the water it becomes

Does he mention my name to you?

Please keep him warm for me

If only my dreaming soul, some token or sign could find
If only the waves would show me where he sleeps

You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration - could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time


Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away


Throw it away
Throw it away


I made a fire, I’m watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?
My mother and my brother’s used to breathing clean air
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
And dreaming I’m a doctor
Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby
It’s hard to be a man when there’s a gun in your hand
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
Oh, I feel so


Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand


Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream


The preacher man said, ""Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart


Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe

Change your flight so you stay with me

And now I wish we never met

While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

Baby, this Christmas
I can't afford too many things
I don't have a dollar, fancy shoes, or diamonds rings
Who needs a shopping spree?
The best things in life are free


Just wrap me up under the Christmas tree


Pretty baby
There may not be presents piled high upon the floor
I got something special that you can't find at any store
You won't need a warranty
That I can guarantee


Just wrap me up under the Christmas tree


Well, Santa may not come tonight
It's alright
It's gonna be a merry Christmas
It's gonna be a merry Christmas
If you see those reindeer flying by
Don't cry
It's gonna be a merry Christmas
It's gonna be a merry Christmas

I know you were wishing for that trip to Paris, France
Have wine on the river, a little fairy tale romance
But we got each other and there's nothing more we need
This cosy apartment, and some real good food to eat
This year, just stay home with me
And I'll love you endlessly


Just wrap me up under the Christmas tree

I did this track for the Church
Everybody talking about they living it dawg
But we need to see it


Aye I'm not ashamed this 116
My crew cliqued up 40 deep with this
Repentant sinners who were called and cleansed
Through the blood-stained banner my recompence
Out of love for my Lord Who I represent
From the island of Samoa to the blocks and the bricks
To the dudes in the gang with the rocks on their wrists
With the Glocks on their hip while they popping their clips
But dawg it's the people dying for lack of this information
I pray that everybody would flock to the Rock of Ages
Especially when they find out we serve a God that's so gracious
But ain't nobody talking to brother when sin-complacent
Born in sin we all is dawg, like Adam we falling dawg
Yet and still He's callin' dawg, and sometimes we be stalling dawg
You run like an athlete, in a track meet and the packed heat
When it's packed deep like a back seat
You can catch me, like a taxi, on the back street
When the fact be, I'm a black sheep
But God chooses to save us mayne, pull us out and rep His name
Plus through Jesus He pleases to use us as His vessels mayne
Cats who wanna walk it and talk it, teach it and preach it
They love it, they live it, they'll go to wherever to reach em


We kingdom people
We're willing to repent and cats that will rep the Lord
Bondservants for His service who live to expect the Lord
We live to bless the Lord cause we confess the Lord
Truthfully all we ever needed was just the Lord


In the midst of this disaster bruh
He's calling for ambassadors
To hit the strip with a clique
Spit truth on how He didn't pass the cup
But how He took the wrath for us
And out of love He asked for us
But we ignore and pass Him up
For the life of the night that's blasphemous
Despite the fact sin's hazardous
Somehow it keeps on grabbing us
Attracting us, dig tracks in us
And before we know it, it masters us
Man how does this happen huh?
We never do plan on acting up
But could it you lacking love
For the Lord ..
We're in a war like Maximus
And discipline builds your character
The typical way we should live life
So men see Christ when they stare at ya
No hocus pocus, magic wands
No one cares you're the pastor's son
Persevere through trials of this life
That's how we improve, pass it on
There's no time to be complacent
Let hope be your motivation
That's enough to spark a movement
Even in incarceration
On campus or in the hood
Stop limping off in the cut
Learn the word and spit it bruh
Man it's time we step it up


Aye first thing first dawg Jesus lives
Heaven dawg you bet it's real
Rep Him till we dead and still
Or at least until the next appeal
This is for my people in the church chilling
All my kingdom people stand up
Man its time we hold it down and live it
Come on dawg cause we Christians
Man there's a war and we missing
We're living slack on our mission
And if you knew your position
Dawg you'd be out representing
Holding your Bible and tract
Yelling revival is back
On the block, in the hood, boondocks
In the woods, in truth, not idiling back
Jesus He died for us dawg
Come on we gotta trust God
Peter was bold in the Spirit
And watched 3000 trust God
And that same Spirit we got Him
Let's put the cross on the move
They should see more than our building
Let's get up out of the pews
Hope this is God in your view
God's with us, Emmanuel
If you with us, rep Him well
And if you not, time will tell
Dawg I don't play with no fraud
Dawg I don't play cause it's hard
Rep His love, rep His grace
Shake this place now for the Lord

That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine

Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem


Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Textbook solutions are so improbable
Cause everybody else is just as empty

Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide
Behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me


Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death?
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath

Failing to connect cause I'm morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead


Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
Cause I can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be insanity

Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death?


Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way

What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God through my facade, don't need material


Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection


Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority

Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him

We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore


We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss

Why still do evil, we don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright

Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me


Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection


Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear
Fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that lives in me
And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit

Without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me
Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you

But in vain they call my name
Teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart, what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel


Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die? Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why

I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive


Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection


Oh Jerusalem

We'd end up hating each other
We'd have fights, you'd cry
Where birds that make a sound are birds
Let me see the world that's real
I have seen the world
Show me how it's done
And it's mean and ugly
Teach me how to laugh, to feel
We could laugh together
Move me to the sun
Stay here with me
Just hold my hand whenever we arrive
Stay here, I love you but we're happy here
Let it be a world with you, stay with me
Any other world with you
Take me to a world where I can be alive
Do you want the world?
Well then, you shall have the world
Ask me for the world again
You shall have the world
A world of skies
That's bursting with surprise
To open up your eyes for joy
We shall see the world come true
We shall have the world
I won't be afraid with you
We shall have the world
You'll hold my hand and know you're not alone
You shall have the world to keep
Such a lovely world you'll weep
We shall have the world forever for our own

Don't start with the ugly part
Don't end with the things that'll make them want to walk away
Tune in at the din again, another price ain't cheap
But somebody's gonna have to pay

Oh yes, you can only guess what it is, what it was
Don't remember what I had in mind
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block
Half-cocked nearly half the time

Give it back, give it back
Give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it


One time for the words divine
And two times for the things that you hope you never have to say
Three scenes in a dead man's dream, and the girls tell the boys
That they better fucking run away

Live it up or g-g-give it up, turn it up, tune it out
Let it rhyme with the other line
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block
Half-cocked nearly all the time

Give it back, give it back
Give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it

"Familiar ground's a distant thing
When you travel vague and crooked roads
And the sun's a scab on vacant skies
Now we always hope we're still alone

There's too much time for idle minds
Imagination's armed with hooks and knives
We count our fears to pass the time
Tired or not, don't close your eyes

A picket fence
A painted house
A quiet life
One where our days are calm
And night's are spent in kind
One where our hopes and dreams
Are attainable things
One where time can't reach

Gain half the plains now
Cut mountain chains down
Sleep when you can
You can't know how the night's fall

Things will be better there
Things will be good there
Don't stop to think
Just chase the dream we're chasing

I smell the fireplace
Warm light, a warm face
A quiet life
A life, a life, a life, a life
A life along the breeze

The dogs came at midnight
Guns drawn and eye's bright
I heard them laughin'
Black voices scratchin'
Black wind they move like
Our lives ain't worth the millions
As dog's tear the canvas
Flies on the carcass
But it buys the time we need

The dogs came at midnight
The dogs came at midnight
The dogs came at midnight
And I always hear them laughing

Chill
Light on my side as my ego becomes
A funky child with some words on my tongue
Be like intake of breath and my mouth gets loose
So while I scatter my spit, I dream of juice
Have you ever made out in dark hallways?
Displayed a kiss that made the day?
Or, say, play a track from your record collection
It's your mix, congratulations


We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now


I bet you light up when we start the show
Follow me now, very closely 'cause I told you so
You know we glow because we throw sun rays
Now we be freaky and we want to stay

Guaranteed to turn it out as bad as Dolemite
Because we're dope, kid, change like the chameleon
And the channel, whatever the whack show the ""Real World"" is on
You know we dazzle like ghetto box boomin' battles
Rattle inside your head, feel redeemed like cola bottles
Fall in love with your teachers, on the wax we are self made
Check the technique, 311 in L. A


We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you you

Keep my feet on the ground
Keep my head in the clouds
Electrified by the sound
It comes from the down, and

Gotta get on my way
Nine o'clock in the morning
Hope I'm not too late


'Cause I been thinking 'bout you
Words can not explain
Any price I'd say for you
So I took the bus downtown
Traffic made me wait
I should get out now and try to run the rest of the way
You're all that matters to me
It would be a shame
If someone took my place today


Oh please
Please don't leave before I get to you
I don't know what I would do without you
Oh, I, I might cry, cry, cry

When I got there, so aligned
People all outside
Wrapped around the block now
I couldn't believe my eyes


But I've been thinking 'bout you
Words can not explain
Any price I'd say for you
So I tried to cut the line
Security said, ""Nice try""
Damn, they knocked my ass out
But I put up a fight
Just to feel your sole
Your tongue against my skin
Oh, I gotta find my way


Oh please
Please don't leave before I get to you
I don't know what I would do without you
Oh, I, I might cry, cry, cry

Jerry Jeff Walker stumbled up the stairs on his way to the
Stage with a Martin guitar and a six pack
Yeah and he was the poet of the Lone Star state


And I was young enough
To think I was good enough to be his opening act
And in a cloud of smoke he took another toke
And counted one, two, three
And I knew right there just breathing his air
What I wanted to be


Buckaroos and jaded lovers
L.A. freeway and redneck mother
Mothers who had raised a son so well
Talking outlawed, long hair loners and stoners
Singing about to come back home and
Most likely too far gone to get there


Hey, Kix, that was 76
That was just enough beer
To get us through the set
And get as high as our crowd
We got 700 miles Jerry, we gotta go
You're out of your mind;
You'll never make it on time
Why not just have another round
Oh, we were trying get paid
Just trying to get laid
Living on love
Sleeping on the stage
Just turn another page
Never thinking we'd ever grow up




Well, the way I recall the 70's
We were down in Austin and the establishment were
Saying we were wasting our time
The next thing I know
We were making more money than we could count
We're all being sued by the IRS
And having more fun than the law allowed
Yeah, I'm talking loners and stoners
And sing about to come back home
And most likely too far gone to get there
Yeah, they were all most likely too far gone to get there

"She was a living doll
The rainbow in one eye
And the other
Bluer than the bluest sky

This fairy took a stroll among the strawberries
To have some breakfast with the fellow fairies

“Some rose petal stew
And a drop of morning dew
That'll do,""
She contemplated
Slightly irritated
About her frustration
Towards creation

Being ethereal
Could drive her hysterical
Particularly since she has a physical
Appetite

Then this punk came by
And she said, ""Hi""

His neon hair stood upright
And shades hid his eyes against the light
The pins piercing his skin
Expressed the state he was in

But something was very alive in his pants
And he took it out with both hands

""I'll fuck you fairy,"" he said
""Right here in the fucking strawberry bed
Lick my dick!"" he insisted
Her ethereal mind was totally twisted
Right out of her head

""Good golly, I'm getting rather wet
But, is this all I'm gonna get?
Hardly more than a drop of morning dew!
I didn't really come, how about you?""

But the punk was on his way
And in the fairy forest the fairy had to stay
And like many of us, with herself she had to play
For the remainder of this exciting, wonderful, this very day

"It was the way we always knew
That we never had the clue
That we never had the chance
Like the others in the dance

Like black diamonds, ash and light
Like the mines and anthracite
Split-tongued fellows, venom-survived
Violence only against the vile

Here, we bleed into the wild
Then laid to rest there, man or child
This shining gutter in the sun
Is it worth it in the run?

Get that bodies rocking from side to side

She know I'm hiding all this pain inside, but she'll never see a nigga cry

You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely

That I let you down
Caused you so much misery

No more yearning without me

And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me

Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say

Everything falls down and breaks in silence
We could forgive and then forget and start over
We could finally try it stone cold sober
No more dark clouds over the horizon

God rest her soul
Until there was no love
Until it was all gone
Nothing could grow

We killed it in cold blood


Loneliness is the curse of the broken hearted
I came undone and you just fell apart
Maybe some distance can heal us both now
We had it one but we lost it somehow
Maybe the dark clouds are finally behind us

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one


Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh, ""It's the madness in his eyes""
As he breaks the night to cry:


It's really me
Really you and really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you and really Me
You'll lose me, though I'm always
Really free


And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud


And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand


And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
""Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down""
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in heaven
They don't look the same to me
I just wade the tides that turned
'Til I learn to leave the past behind


It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine


All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Have no time to watch them grow
Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me


It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine


Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missing
Missing all this time


It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine

"Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done
We’ve killed each one
And the table’s full and overflowed
And the corner sign
Says it’s closin' time
So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road

Oh every girl that ever I’ve touched
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever I’ve hurt
I did not do it knowingly
But to remain as friends
You need the time to make amends
And stay behind
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past
I’ll bid farewell and be down the line

Oh every foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes
Must meet the dawn
And if I see the day
I’d only have to stay
So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone

Oh, every thought that’s strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung
But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes
It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung
But the time ain’t tall, if on time you depend
And no word is possessed by no special friend
And though the line is cut
It ain’t quite the end
I’ll just bid farewell 'til we meet again

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So I’ll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn

"I come to you, sweet man
And I'm falling on my knees
I come to you, pretty papa
Fallin' on my knees
Ask if you don't have nobody
Won't you kindly take me please

Cause I'm a mighty tight woman
I'm a real tight woman
I'm a jack of all trades
I can be your sweet woman
Also be your slave
Honey, I can do things so good
You will swear that I behave

I got all of them saying
That I'm tight in everything I do
Got all the men crying
I'm a broad that will never be blue
All I need is a good man
And I will make him happy too

You ain't got no business here
Cause when you're out with me
Well I might make your little wife shed a tear
Cause I'm a mighty tight woman

Rode into town and only eighteen
My girl beside me and a baby in a car seat
Everybody called me crazy
That was fine as long as I knew
She believed
Not a nickel to our name
Cheap motel east side of town just south of Main
Songs I wrote for change
And one day I'd be headlining the stage


She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer


I just got the news today
You know that song I wrote for you has made its way
Then oh so much has changed
You know the one thing that has always stayed the same


She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer


Beautiful believer
Every time I doubt myself
Before I even ask for help
She's right there next to me
A beautiful believer
Every night I close my eyes
Just knowing that she's by my side
That's all I really need


She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home

"My friend David was a good kid
He had my back, always knew he did
He was different than most
And maybe I was too
Hanging out with the in-crowd just wasn't our thing
There was a whole lot more
Than we could see on these plains
Well, some people just seem to get stuck, and hang around
It's college or trade school for those with the means
There's never been any small town dreams
For those in between
Yeah the poor folks they go to work, or they go to war
I did fifteen hundreds days in the corps
And I got back, nothing looked the same anymore
I got on with the local police, it just seemed to fit
Things have changed

By then David had a daughter and a son
And a rap sheet to prove all the time that he'd done
He was just a burned out beat down shell of my old friend
And on a three day binge he was speeding through town
And I bumped the wailers just to try and slow him down
He didn't know that it was me, and he took off
Oh how things change

And I found his truck in the floodplain upside down
It was a hell of a rain I didn't know if he'd drowned
Or if he died on impact, it must have rolled three times
Yeah, the only thing to make matters worse
Is that his mama's a late night ER nurse
And he was DOA, she just about lost her mind

David's wife drops by every once in a while
And childhood stories always make her smile
But somehow we always go back to that day

Come and listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge, says he
""Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll surely hang,"" says he
""And after that, Jim Jones
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones.""


And our ship was high upon the sea
Then pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin' round us
And the winds a-blowin' gale
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales


Now it's day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains
Well, into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bush rangers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the flogger down
Oh, I'll give the law
A little shock
Remember what I say
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay

I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...


She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town


For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

No one tells us what is hard and what is fair

Maybe peace on Earth, no more empty seats in church
Might be what's on His wishlist

Made my Daddy wonder where my good sense went

To be something I've always been in my heart
Just for the chance to play you my song
The thrill when I hear you singing along
It's been worth everything I've been through
To do what I do
I've played for empty tables and chairs
The drunks that don't listen, the crowds that don't care
Been told countless times, ""Boy you ain't going nowhere""
To do what I do
So I hope the critics and skeptics alike
All bought a ticket to this show tonight
And they'll see firsthand that I have survived
And what doesn't kill you makes you more alive
And I'm one of the fortunate few
To do what I do
There's so much joy this music can bring
So I count my blessings when I step up to sing
Cause they're so many people who would give anything

And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance


Yeah, he was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but she never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight


Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said I'll turn you on sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came in by her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride


Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier
Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card
He said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground
Asked him which was the way back home
He said take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then boy, you're on your own


And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw
A gap but figured he'd be all right


He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Woah, but but mama that's where the fun is


I was blinded
Oh mama, oh mama

Oh mama, oh mama

Of two mules, trains and rain
The best is always yet to come
That’s what they explain to me
Just do your thing, you’ll be king

If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
So it may flow and be
To each his own, it’s all unknown

Stand up straight and tall

There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!


There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing


Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands


Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy, Lord
The band kept us too busy we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band, Lord
They're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on
Keep on dancing thru the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing


Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands


Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

Hey, yeah
Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah

You talkin' all that jazz

Deranged from the blood stains all over my brain
Just another day, this killer train is ridin' down your way
I'm fucking starting to unthread, these voices that's in my head
I got a romance with the dead, and sleeping in river beds, uh
Damaging my organs, to me, they just ain't important
I'm a different kind of breed, the one that don't even breathe
The one you ain't gotta feed, just rob and take what I need
Fucking product of the $uicide, fucking spawn of Satan
Cuttin' on my wrist, while these women fornicating
I'm debating to take my life, forsaken by sacrifice
Mistaken for something nice


Pile of ashes is my final form
Got a roll of duct tape, and a rag soaked in chloroform
Flies swarm because my body's warm, shatter the urn
See me blowing in the wind like a scattered storm
Grey matter splattered in front of the corner store
Saw that when I was fourteen, walking around the 2nd Ward
Send him to the seventh floor
Ended up with floor seats to something I didn't want to see
Now that scene is in my head every time I go to sleep
When I dream, I rest in peace knowing I'll be dead
Earth will be my final bed
Poison me with lead, inject it into my fucking head


Pressure, pressure
How do I dear deal with all this pressure?
In my way
It’s in my lungs
It’s in my thoughts
It’s in my brain
A guilty conscience some might say, I’m paranoid and locked away
A withering weed in the garden that God wasn't supposed to save
Locked up in an open grave
Reading King James' Bible
With a couple quotes erased, but kept the ones that made me smile
Do I really see everything for what it is?
Or is it that I can’t see anything with such a bad case of denial
When I die, then put my body in a boat
And light it on fire, push me out to sea
And let the wind do what I might-a
No matter whatever I feel about anything
It wasn’t until I burned all my bridges
It made my future brighter

I was silk sheathed in steel

This must be magic 

This must be love

Chasing rainbows, chasing wealth

One angry young man in my own vietnam

At war with the world but just killing myself

Seen fortune in my lifetime
Gave it all to the man instead
Still tomorrow comes, I'm still standing on my own two feet
Got a woman at home
She treats me well


Anger, I seen it rise
From a careless word that I said
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
Got a woman at home
She told me that
Got a woman at home
She taught me well


Found sorrow in my mind most times
Gave it all back to the life I led
Well since times change, it all just rolls away
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well


She's alright
When everyone is wrong
She's alright
Lets me waste another song
Stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well


Mourning, I've done my time here
Stood here watching my own death
Well a few things going my way this time
Got a woman at home
She treats me well


Slumber, not in my lifetime
Won't spend my days in my bed
Make the whole scene gather round come see it my way
Now I got a woman at home
She treats me well

It seems I should have walked away
Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight, in sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I wore the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises but who dares to pull the strings


I know this may be hard for you to believe and all
But you only exist because we allow it


I've questioned all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?


By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem a stunningly short time


You've been beaten down time and time again
But still you find yourself at the center of it all


I've questioned all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?


You hear me, you had one thing to do, one thing
And you fucked it up, piece of shit

We need 500cc of Blue Comfort

Is truth only what we believe is real?

And take a breath before it's all erased away

Yo, we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at my Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm, let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo, I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path 
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that


I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
We're gonna make it, that's for sure
If you're stressed then let it go
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually


You got the N.W.O. 
Your baby's on the way 
And crosstown killas trying to 
Ayo they got me stressed out 


Dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lo, dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lee
Me no look for trouble but trouble done follow me
All I wanted to be was a illa MC
Ever since me was small as a youth out in Queens
What did you mash on de dancehall 
Until my best friend caught two in him head 
And ever since that day  things been a mess
R.I.P Ghosta Rock, true ting, God bless
So nowadays I go see wifey just to cure me from stress
Lay my head on her breast
Sugar dumpling knows best
Explaining all my problems to her getting things off my chest
A little hook up, squeeze up, and no more am I vexed
Ayo son, without my peeps I'd be truly assed out
Make sure I have my medication so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me, when everyone was fessing
Most of all Jah Mighty for the guidance and the blessings


I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

"Voice from the mountain
And a voice from the sea
Voice in my neighbourhood
And a voice calling me
Tell me my friend my friend
Tell me with love
Where can it end it end
Voice from above

The sound on the ocean wave
And the sound in the tree
Sound in a country lane
Say can you be free
Tell me you crowd you crowd
Tell me again
Tell me out loud out loud
This sound is rain

Tune from the hillside
And tune full of light
A flute in the morning
And a chime in the night
I know the game again
I know the score
I know my name my name
But this tune is more

Voice from the mountain
And voice from the sea
Voice from in my neighbourhood
And a voice calling me
Tell me my friend my friend
Tell me with love
Where can it end it end

Can I have a minute?
I've gotta tell you something
I heard that someone likes you
And it might be nothing but he's right in front of you
He's kinda my size
Don't look back cause he's looking
I think you know him
But you just don't know that he's right in front of you


Baby, you've been talking to him nearly every day
He really likes all the games that you play
He told me to tell you to see what you'd say
Before he jumps in and he asks for a date


Cause I've got this friend who's crazy about you
I've got this friend who can't be without you
I've got this friend and I wish I could see
How this would end if you knew it was me


Something I have to tell you
He plays the bass guitar
He thinks you'd like him better
If he had a car but now he's right in front of you


Baby, you've been talking to him nearly every day
He really likes all the games that you play
He told me to tell you to see what you'd say
Before he jumps in and he asks for a date

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you


I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show



So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming

Suddenly I feel all right

And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight


Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
Smiling, having fun 
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
Like I always do 
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you


Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only



There are moments when I think I'm going crazy

But it's gonna be alright

Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight


Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
Smiling, having fun 
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
Like I always do 
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you


So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms, and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight


Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
Smiling, having fun 
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue 
Like I always do 
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you


 ...lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun 
Smiling, having fun 
Feeling like a number one

Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real


Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' 80 on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me, hahaha
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it

Let's get it on!
It's time to get in the game
You got to fight until it hurts and then you do it again
Let's tear it up!
I'm staying straight to the core, ain't no room for second place, go big or go home!


Rise!
It's dog eat dog, rise!
Man versus beast, rise!
The strong will survive, rise!
I've got no time for the weak


It's time to rise up, man up, get back up, never been and won't be broken
Dust off and then come back for more
You've got to reach down, dig deep, and break ground
Show them all you won't be beaten
Brush it off and then come back for more!
Come back for more


It's do or die!
Time to settle the score, got to give it all you got and then you give it some more
There will be blood
You've got to fight until you break, talk a lot of trash and step up to the plate


Rise!
Refuse to give in, rise!
Ashes to dust, rise!
Make them remember your name, rise!
Because in yourself you can trust


It's time to rise up, man up, get back up, never been and won't be broken
Dust off and then come back for more
You've got to reach down, dig deep, and break ground
Show them all you won't be beaten
Brush it off and then come back for more!
Come back for more

Old mister fun is back
Wonder where he's been hiding at
Hanging round the edge
Walls unfortified, inside

No different, patchwork hack
Toil away on an unlaid track
Falls closing in, got nowhere to hide
This time


Finding ceilings low
I'm too big or this room's too small
Why's my ceiling another's floor


Past twisted, expected warp
Attention span increasingly short
Hard to breathe, this altitude will get you high
I've tried


Finding ceilings low
I'm too big or this room's too small
Why's my ceiling another's floor


And nobody can tell you
It's a moment in time
That defines and deforms you

That I never knew 
They been there forever 
But it's the first time that I flew




You're the stars in my sky 
And there's no wondering why 
Now the moon's coming out

There was never a doubt
Just the sudden embrace
Your beautiful soul
Your beautiful face
One sweet kiss

What a fool he must be
To want someone else

Well I watched and I waited

Like a thief I slipped in
To take what I could

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence


In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence


And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence


""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence


And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence""

Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet

A$AP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant

Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Testarossa, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get in and get chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up

Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys'
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah


I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G


My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers

So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah


I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

So when you're crossing over, let me know you're real
Put that flex on your neck, now you got the feel
Rumble like the thunder, now you're going under

I can't repair

Making objects
Out of thoughts
Making more than

Eating food

A body that

Dressed as Jew
O mask of iron
I was there for you

Moods of glory
Moods so foul
The world comes through
A bloody towel

And death is old
But it's always new
I freeze with fear

So I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So I'll play it dirty until your body is breaking

We've got to make love tonight
Because we're burning up


You make me greedy, you won't feed me my food
But I'll make out easy, because I see straight through you
You cool me off and hot me up and that's not right
Because you'll get hungry in the heat of the night


And then we'll make love, just when it's right
And when we make love tonight
We'll be burning up

I know you feel the flame
Staring deep inside of you
Burning you up, breaking you down
Breaking you out in a cold sweat
And as you lose control, of your very soul
Your desire takes over
You'll feel the heat sway
You're round to my way
And suddenly you'll know that you're burning up

History was the cruel judge of overconfidence
Back in the days of shock and awe
Back in the days of ""mission accomplished""
Our chief was landing on the deck
The sun was setting on a golden photo op
Back in the days of ""mission accomplished""
Thousands of bodies in the ground
Brought home in boxes to a trumpet's sound
No one sees them coming home that way
Thousands buried in the ground
Thousands of children scarred for life
Millions of tears for a soldier's wife
Both sides are losing now
Heaven takes them in

We went with what we knew and now we can't go back

I'm half remembered, half way across the world
Twice removed from a second home
The shadow of a ghost in an old haunt
With a lease on life 'cause I can't afford to own
When being young starts getting old
A new place saves face or so I’m told
Be the new kid on an old block
A chalk outline on a playground blacktop


I’m just a moment so don’t let me pass you by
We could be a story in the morning but we’ll be a legend tonight
I’m just a moment so don’t let me pass you by
And they can speak our names in a dead language
'Cause you and I, we’re alive
But just for a moment


I’m twice the man that I thought I was yesterday
Half the time, I’m a world away
A flicker of a soul casting silhouettes
On the face of a town that could not get me to stay
And when the spark’s gone, former lovers
Just looking for a bus to throw me under
I’ll be the new kid on an old block
A chalk outline on a playground blacktop

What it's worth, I tell them pictures paint a thousand of words
So get the picture, our existence is as one, now ya heard?

To live, you gotta be evil
To love, you gotta evolve

I've lost a part of me
'Cause I am just an open book for everyone to see
I always leave empty handed; I can't keep the things that mean the most to me
I'm walking steady on a tightrope clinging only to the words that I wrote
I might be temporarily blind but I'm not stupid


Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? 
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. 
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down


I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough and that's alright with me
You take me for granted. I tried to help you be who you wanna be
I'm a sucker for a complication
Here goes another week it must seem
You weren't worth my time, you weren't worth my time
I still let you take it from me


Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? 
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. 
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down


Why do I always do this to myself?
Always depending on everyone else
You know it's going to drive me crazy
You're just a notch in the wall that made me




Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? 
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place.

One shot, two shot, three, Tequila floor
Cowboy bouncers about to bowl me out the door

That worms got a kick like a Tennessee mule
Wake up in the morning, hurting head, skinned knees
Ain't no doubt about what's putting a whooping on me


Tequila goes down easy, Lord, it sneak up on me fast
Tequila, great big buzz in a little bitty glass

Glass, salt, straight up, chilled lemon, lime
Blue on the rocks, frozen margarita's time

All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too


Wasteland, baby

All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns, at all worth in the fight fell too


Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby


And that day that we watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
And you gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs

Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking

Not an end, but the start of all things that are left to do

Well, bartender's working on a late night shift
Cheap bums and blondes and barmaids on a midnight drift
And the dance band's playing the same old sling
I'm sinkin' whiskey and you're sippin' fine wine

Well, it should be you, but it's me who can hardly move

And help the blind

That head of yours has got you by, time and time again
My arms and legs are achin' and my head's about to blow
And your back's been breakin' and I'd hate to spoil the show
But I just spent next week's wages and I'm right out of coin
But you want more and it's half past four, and they want to close the joint

Carry me home

Don't leave me lying here, in all this beer!




You drank all your booze and half of mine
I'm bleary eyed and you're waiting for the sunshine

Just like the man who threw me on the floor
Don't matter, while I'm down here, I might as well try and find the back end door
Excuse me, have you seen it?

You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that?

Guess the vodka brought the feeling back

Found somebody better, like I never met ya

At the ripe age of 24, I done seen it all, done it all
Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled
Dealin' with time, winter, spring, summer, fall
It's crazy changes, is this that made me famous?
I come a long way from Timbs, minimum wages
Stockin' caps, summer jobs, pockets flat
It's funny how my childhood idols now be coppin' crack
I ain't knockin' that, unfortunately, life's too short to see
It's only right we move accordingly at every second
I use to carry heavy weapons
Previously cocked, tucked in my shirt for every session
But hold up, a 2-6 bid made me grow up
Came home to the same damn dreams with no luck
And half the clique's strong, the other half moved on
Some with new lives and new wives, niggas live long
The foulest thing about time - it still ticks when you gone


For those who live the way I live, we came a long way
From wipin' cold outta eyelids to rap's hottest
Smokin' lye, let track guide us
Remember back then before MAC-10's, expensive bottles?
Had a sick mind, niggas taught me how to get mine
We'd often sip quarts, they get tossed at the spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to gip for their time
While we plan to live forev', he had a different design
Is it safe to say, we all perish on the sacred day?
With my luck, soon as I reach the gate, they make me pay
Pray, minutes go by, Indigo high
The specialist, decked out dark specs, finessin' it
Used to play catch-a-kiss, same girls back then
Now, leave us messages, a whole lot
Travel to my old spot where we sold rock, although it's trifle
Ain't nothin' changed, just like time, it's all a cycle


Yo, wake up to the world, stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision, focus, get wise, enlargen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark is unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first skid bid, nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game
Love the night rain, found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, it's all a race to the top
Tryin' to freeze time, that's why I iced the face of my watch

What will happen in the morning
When the world it gets so crowded
That you can't look out the window in the morning?


And what will happen in the evening
In the forest with the weasel
With the teeth that bite so sharp
When you're not looking in the evening?


And all the friends that you once knew are left behind
They kept you safe and so secure
Amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime


What will happen, in the morning
When the world it gets so crowded
That you can't look out the window in the morning?


Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
Now, take a little while to make your sister fair
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eyeshade
Start over again


Now, take a little while to find your way in here
Now, take a little while to make your story clear
Now that you're lifting your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor and never look 'round

She's back again, in my mind
If songs were lines in a conversation

"All the trees stood like skeletons
Silhouettes of spilled ink
And the snows fell in sheets and got wrapped around our feet
We built the fire evermore with winter beating at the door

Brother's eyes were getting heavier
His bony hands cold and white
And I could hear his ragged breathing like the wind along a knife
There beside him through the night, in the hum of candlelight
I no longer felt the time

Brother woke just after midnight
And he didn't make a sound
And as he climbed from out of bed with severed rings around his head
His feet didn't touch the ground

I could feel it then
A tiny miracle
So I followed him
Into the woods
Crossed beneath the trees
But only I left my prints in tow
He was afloat
Found a lonely tree
And tied himself within its limbs
And he said to me these words:
Don't you fear for me
I am where I'm supposed to be

And when I woke he was gone
And I was wrapped in blankets on the lawn
The sky was blue and my skin matched the hue
And I could hear mother crying in your room
From here on out I wear this face for both of us

Fucked the girl of my dreams in the house of my dreams
Got the car of my dreams know you know how I'm feeling shit - I'm feeling fucking good

There's a tumbleweed inside of me that's never gonna stop
There's a mountain out there somewhere I still haven't climbed

'Cause I'm a son of the sun, a brother to the sky

Found some truth in the blue
Let the desert air burn inside my lungs

I wanna look down on a valley
Where the river splits the stone
Let the great wide open
Open wide my soul
I could never live without you
I always come back to you

And go howl at the moon

It's AZ, with the youngin in charge
Ayo Abso, this here's a go


Smell the exotic cologne in the air
Beach chairs near the grill, chill, Coronas of beer
Conceal firearms, grown ups is here
Prada don, got a closet full, could loan you pair
It's presence, certified if ya story is true
I'm from the essence, speaks from a warrior's view
Since adolescent, seen the system slaughter my crew
Guess this is destined, dance stance is like Kostya Tszyu
Did a Gallardo, aqua blue
Rocked spots with Big Pop', was unstoppable
From hot blocks to the tropicals
From bullet wounds straight to ICU
Don't even sneeze near me
He ain't a killer homie, he's scary
Without his crew the nigga seem leery
Where the vibe at?
All the cars and the live cats
You see the squad, nigga slide back, the God symbolize rap
Ratchets blowin', caskets closin'
You bastards get rich is only half the slogan
It's mastered, muh'fuckas tryin' to fast me forward
From the streets to the nastiest poet, and y'all know it

If she was a drink
She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick
A chill and a burn all at the same time


She's Sunday drive meets
High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane



And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm


I know how to make her laugh
Or blush, or mad at me
But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry


And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane


And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm


She's the girl of a lifetime
A guy like me spends his whole life
Looking for, that girl right there's the perfect storm
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
She destroys me in that t-shirt

I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita
Vishnu was trying to persuade the prince that, he should do his duty
And, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form, and says, ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""


Oh, how can this be? I've finally found peace
Just how long 'til she's stripped from me?
So come on, baby, in time we'll all freeze
Ain't no stoppin' that entropy


Am I just a dog who's found me a bone
Or perhaps if I've found a home?
Been sniffin' around all over the town
I just can't stop settlin' down


His eye's on the sparrow, eyes is on me
More eyes than the KGB
Sometimes I'll suffer, sometimes I'll bleed
Not all at once, time flows linearly
Only forwards, never backwards
Seek the darkness, seek the laughter
Raise my jersey to the rafters
Let moths consume me in the light


Oh, how can this be? I've finally found peace
Just how long 'til she's stripped from me?
So come on, baby, in time we'll all freeze

So maybe my ego's out of control
Can that be avoided? I don't know
I hated myself when I was a boy
Now that I don't, they're tryna take my joy

More eyes than the KGB 
Sometimes I'll suffer, sometimes I'll bleed

No life without energy

In disguise as no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
The sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain

Won't you come

Steal the warm wind tired friend

Hang my head, drown my fear

With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made

To cash in on the desert faces
He's got a truckload of Yorkshire girls
For the harem going places
And the border bums never saw
The guns in the whiskey cases

And it's written in the palm of his hand

He's gonna sweep away the sand

And shipped it to the U.S.A

And the sun shines out of your ass

And the long knives have massacred the tribe

No more smoke from sacred fires touch these hills

Got no time for this life that I’m living up
Shackled down, kicked around, now slave to the grind
Need some time for myself


I’ll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time, so I’ll get up with you
If you don't understand, man, you’ve gotta believe
There's too much of you, but there's not enough of me
There's not enough of me


Same old song, world moves on while I’m still in bed
Meet tomorrow today just to get ahead
Jump the gun on the run
I’m the only one who thinks I’m falling behind


I’ll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time, so I’ll get up with you
If you don't understand, man, you’ve gotta believe
There's too much of you, but there's not enough of me
There's not enough of me
I’ll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time, so I’ll get up with you
If you don't understand, man, you’ve gotta believe
There's too much of you, but there's not enough of me

All I wanna say...
Girl, I wanna say...
I'm saying that I'm sorry...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


August 4th, we were chilling at the house
Said I'm done, I told you to get out
Didn't mean a word that I said
Cause I was hoping you would come back


'Cause I tried and tried
And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
And I tried to fight and I cried to God
Oh please let it just work
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed, baby...


All you have to do is say that I'm sorry 
And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this 
Say baby, I'll do what it takes
And I will be here all the way, baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry 


You wanna know if I was moving on without you

To tell the truth i've thinking bout you lately

Christmas day, you said you had a ring
But you changed your mind
Too caught up in the streets
Boy, your truth is hard to believe
Why are you really scared of me?


'Cause I tried and tried
And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
'Cause I put in mine and worked overtime
And you never put in your work
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
'Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed, baby...


All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby, I'm sorry 
And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this 
Say baby, I'll do what it takes
And I will be here all the way, baby
All you had to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby, I'm sorry


You wanna know if I was moving on without you

Totell the truth, I've thinking bout you lately
I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you


I miss the way you hold me
The way you touch me
I miss the way you kiss me, yeah
All I wanna do 
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
Is say that I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
So sorry baby


All you have to do is say that I'm sorry

And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this 
Say baby, I'll do what it takes
And I will be here all the way, baby
All you had to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby, I'm sorry


You know I think about you sometimes
I wonder how you are
Are you happy?
You see, I know 
What we had was special
And I know you know it too
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I really miss you...

"Here on the street
Feeling the cool of the dawn
Shuffling feet
Faces are ragged and worn
They've been working all night
Waiting for the curtain to rise
While you're under the sheets
You with the stars in your eyes
Letter box noise
Snapping the day into life
Newspaper boys
Cutting the mist like a knife
We're beginning to rise
Curtain up the drama begins
It's the start of the race
All of us wanting to win
People rushing shouting pushing
Got no time for conversation
Inner city population
The struggle for communication
People trying pressure rising
Hook and hustle flex your muscle
It's all part of living
Do you wanna get away
Restaurant smells
Mix in the heat of the day
Telephone bells
Kissogram girls on her way
Someone's thinking of you
Birthday boy is in for a treat
And the message is clear
Once a year life can be sweet
Caught in a flash
Cover girl freezes her smile
Media trash
Blinding the crowd with such style
It's a dazzling affair
A fantasy to star in your dreams
Do you want to believe
Everyone knows what they've seen
Twilight time in the city
And the shutters are down
That's when the singles are lost in their doubles
The happy hour comes round
To help you unwind in the shadows
Takes the tension away
It's been a hell of a day in the city
Now it's your time to play
Living under pressure
Do you wanna buy a dream?
I say Phil can you get it he say
Alright alright alright
Tell me when can I get it he say
Tonight tonight tonight
I want money on delivery hey
That's right that's right that's right
I say baby don't you trust me he say
The city's a jungle where the strongest survive
Neonic heat
Flooding the darkness with light
The capitol beats
Feeding the pulse of the night
It's the music of life
Listen to the sound of the crowd
Where the rhythm's so strong
And the music is playing so loud
Where the rhythm's so strong
And the music is playing so....

Honestly, somehow it always seems
That I'm dreamin' of somethin' I can never be
It doesn't matter to me
'Cause I will always be that pimp that I see in all of my fantasies
I don't know your fuckin' name
So what? Let's...
Screamin' to be the only way
That I can truly be free from my fucked up reality
So I dream and stroke it harder
'Cause it's so fun to see my face starin' back at me
I don't know your fuckin' name
So what? Let's fuck!

Last night I took a turn I never should
I knew nothing good would come of this
Morning's come now and the smoke has cleared
How did I get here from a single kiss


I can't undo what's been done
When the web's already spun
I got caught up in desire
No matter what I say
I can't make it go away
The trouble's just begun
Can't undo what's been done


When I get home there will be hell to pay
I wish there was a way to ease the pain
In a heartbeat I could lose it all
Then my tears would fall, fall like pouring rain


I can't undo what's been done

Closer than before
I know you feel the same way, too
Watercolor nights
You painted these, I'm impressed by you


Question love and God
And will you find what you're looking for
We laugh so we don't cry
Purple teeth lying on the floor


Just like that
You've come back again
My cracked lips
On a familiar skin


But I slept in my clothes
'Cause I'm too scared of us
I know what I lost in those previous months
Perplexed on the porch
'Cause you hate what I do
So why did you ask me to stay here with you?


Easier than this
I'm guilty of living black and white
Quick to let me know
There's so much more than what meets the eye

And what are we even living for
We dance so we don't die

I could touch her if I fuckin' wanna
So why you wanna insist to diss?
I got your name at the top of ""fuckin' dead bitch"" list
Meet Mr. Makaveli's terror, mack of the year, thug of the era
Death Row and Outlawz, nobody does this shit better
My lyrics explode on contact, best prepare for combat
Ain't no stoppin' so bomb back
It's the last days, niggas is dyin' for bullshit
MAC-11 is heavy, yet I'm ready to pull quick
Niggas ain't ready for a brother that's livin' major
Bear witness to a sick motherfucker that's spittin' razors
When I cut 'em they cut, when I stick 'em they stuck
And my ambitions to bust, 'cause I ain't givin' a fuck
We tore the neighborhood up, look at all the shit that we did

Just takes a nigga with the right automatic to cause static

Make 'em role of a bitch, like Michael Jackson, "" Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' ""
Holla at my crew and they perish, who do you cherish?
Got that ass in my sight
Tonight I'm bussin' off the terrace with multiple gun shots
Niggas is droppin' rapidly, bussin' at crooked cops
Them bitches is runnin' after me, tell 'em I'm high
When they ask ""why I'm trippin' out the top of my drop?""
'Cause you know why?
Keep dippin' on my block they sell rocks and box with frail cops
If not we buss shots from Glocks, fuck cops
My only fear of death, can you hear me, it's ""comin' back""
Had enough of this bullshit world so none of that
I felt no remorse for all the shit that we did
Niggas dyin', hear the sirens, if my enemies love their kids

Losin' your life, what for?
Facin' a young muthafucker who puts it down for the dough
Get killed in front of your kids, God forbid if it happen
'Cause the shit I'm on now I'm taking pass on us rappin'
Gotta survive by myself, but at the same time get wealth
Won't put my gun on the shelf, it keeps me livin' like heaven
But when the shit jumps I'm ready 'cause I already knew
You better get us muthafucker 'fore we come get you
Deep in my heart I think this shit's about to pop any moment
Tryna do me like my parents but I'm a tougher opponent


This nigga scared, must be rusty and all I'm prepared
For all the drama, you stayed with all them niggas you feared
You fuckin' busta, musta let the evil or the money trap you and slappin' at'chu
Every second we comin' at you and you the last one
When no rocksis tryna cast one
Guess a young rider who would die for fuckin' blast of that thug passion
Clashin' on enemies passin'
Gigglin' when they should've been figurin' who would be the last one, laughin'

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and e'er pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever
His power and glory evermore proclaim
O night divine, O night, O night divine

People think I'm buggin or I have the heebiejeebies
The reason they can't find me is because they can't see me




It's like the war's going on in the middle of your mind
But your mind can't contain Incognito's on the brain
So you chill by yourself
Don't really sweat nobody
Speak to all the brothers and say peace to every hottie
But lurking in the ghetto is a germ that insists
Should you back the germ away? Or utilize your fists
Neither of the two, just continue with your thoughts
And wash away your pain with the power of the quart
Ain't got no time for girls, 'cause girls be on some bull
Checkin for a nigga who got crazy pull
On some deep-rooted sexual, highly intellectual
Not checking for the fame although it's perpetual
I entered the world the same way I'll exit
If you really dig the groove, then hey, glad you checked it
'Cause Incognito's strong, not irking like a blister
Before you speak about me, make sure you call me Mister

"I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gonna grow and glow
'Til I'm so blue pure perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
But I'm gonna kneel and pray everyday
Lest I should become vain along the way
I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day

I'm gonna learn the right way to talk
I'm gonna search and find a better way to walk
I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
'Til I get rid of every single flaw
I'm gonna be the world's best friend
I'm gonna go around shaking everybody's hand
I'm gonna be the cotton-pickin' Rage of the Age

 'What the fuck is that?'
 'Hi, guys, are you in a band or something? I mean it
Would be so cool if you were in a band 'cos you're driving a
Big bus with band on the front of it'

 'Would you like to see Black Bart?'
 'Who's Black Bart?'
 'Let me introduce you'

Black Bart's seen it
Black Bart knows
Black Bart's done it
The Black Bart blues
Suspended in suspension
Many evil nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems
Black Bart's lookin'
Don't know where she's been
Maybe she's an acrobat
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole
We all got to try the Black Bart blues
Black Bart tried most anything
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing
So he asked me to tell ya
Try it for yourself and you will see
We all got to try the Black Bart blues


 'What did you do that for?'
 'I'm sorry, I just..., I guess I'm not used to...
 'Shut up and get on with it will you'

Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now
Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow
So if you are a dancer
You could dance his pole in May
That's a maypole

Black Bart's coming
Now Black Bart's gone
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song
Whatever and however
In and out or several at a time mmm yes!
We all got to do the Black Bart blues
Here comes the guitar solo

We all got to try the Black Bart blues
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!

She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...


He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby


La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa


The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...


She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

A thousand sun-burned souls
Rum-runners and cold Bud Light
A little Friday night summertime rock and roll
Packed in tight, they were singin' along
I was hanging on the edge of the crowd
When you spilled your beer down the back of my shirt
You had me when I turned around


Guitars on the Gulf breeze
Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No, that ain't what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
Lighters in the air


That one look led to a walk on the beach
And more kisses than I could count
The best kind of wild and down-home smile
I've ever had these arms around
The ams were screamin' and the people were too
While were slow dancing on our bare feet
Ain't it funny how we missed it all
And still didn't miss a thing?

How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Brother, I think it's time we talked
Why do guys like us spend most our lives playing it tough?
Oh, and brother, I see this world's got you down
You look like you look when you got your heart broke
In 7th grade by Katie Brown


We played ball out in the yard
We raced our bikes, we wrecked our cars
Stayed out late in midnight bars
Oh, we got drunk out in the 
Fell for the same girl once or twice
And somehow made it out alive
But in the end, always there for each other
Oh, brother


When I couldn't see, you always found a way to believe in me
You were the quarterback when I rode the bench
The knuckleball nobody could hit
If you're the underdog, you're the comeback kid
You'll find a way to get through this


We played ball out in the yard
We raced our bikes, we wrecked our cars
Stayed out late in midnight bars
Oh, we got drunk out in the 
Fell for the same girl once or twice
And somehow made it out alive
But in the end, always there for each other
Brother, oh, brother


I hope you know I'd take a bullet
Stand out on the frontline
Oh, life is short, don't you know it?
But everybody needs a partner in crime


You had my back when dad got sick
You being there's what did the trick
We both thought that that was it
Oh, you were my first call that night in jail
You rushed in to pay my bail
We sure raise a lot of hell
I still make you swear to never tell my mother
Oh, we'll always be there for each other


Brother, oh, brother, yeah
Oh, brother

Well I guess you had to be there
Such a different place
I was cruisin' along
Never thinkin' that we'd ever change
Yeah I guess you had to be there
It was a hell of a ride
Lines were blurry and hurried
But it felt like the stars had aligned


We were sharin' a new day
Singing a new song
And everyone's problems
Were suddenly gone
Everything I ever wanted
Is right before my face
Tell all the beautiful people
Were always at my place


Well I guess you had to be there
All we wanted was more
There were winners and losers
And people passed out on my floor
And you know you should've called me
For that real good time
Guess you missed some of the gold
When you're too busy chasin' the shine




We were sharing a new day
Sipping on a new wine
And everyone's problems
Were suddenly mine
And all you ever wanted
Was right in front of your face
Starts as a good thing
Turns into a headache

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone


And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between


The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life


Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still


And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between


The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life


And I been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds


The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen


The story of my life
I give her hope 
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside

"Giving in to love
And sharing my time
Letting someone into my misery
I told it all step by step

How I landed on the island
And how I swim across the sea
And it crosses my mind
That I may awake to a knife in me

No more breath in my hair or ladies underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem
Heartfelt last line reading

There is no more mystery
Is it going to happen, my love?
There is no more mystery
Is it going to happen, my love?

""It's all in my head"", she said, ""Morning after nightmare""
""You're building a wall"", she said, ""Higher than the both of us
So try living life instead of hiding in the bedroom
Show me a smile and I'll promise not to leave you""

It happened under a rainy cloud
Passing through the dark South
We went into a big house
And slept in a small bed

I didn't know you then
As well as you of me
We talked of our sad lives
And we went on separately

And we went on separately
I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards
Those long forgotten high school fears

""It's all in my head"", I said
Banging on the piano
I've not been so alone
I thought, since kicking in the womb

I drank so much tea
I wrote my letters in kanji
Around the block I walked and walked
Pretending you were with me

Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends
Like birthdays and old friends, we forget
That this flesh blood and bone is human
Trading phone lines for airlines
Unwilling to face
That love is found on the inside
Not the outside

And like a medicine bottle
In the cabinet, I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle
In my hand I will hold you

And swallow you slowly
As to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight
I do not want to lose

The thrill that it gives me
To look out from my window
And scowl at the houses
From my world in the bedroom

It's all in his head, she read
In a girlfriend's self-help book
It's all his own making
A war with himself

Like two sides of a wall
That separates two countries
He shuts out the world he once knew
To love you

Not wanting to die out here
Without you
Not wanting to die out here
Without you

Starting fresh, building slow, take my time cause now...I know
 This that kush right here...this that sour...its serious...


I'm reinvented weed scented
Coup exceeding the speed limit smoke easing through the roof
Few regrets breathe through the youth
I'm a seasoned vet I need no excuse baby
Still rubble flights on that Delta shuttle
Patron's in me so the shots is doubled no envy
A few pennies polished persona
Jews defend me it wasn't me honest your honor
I'm a loose cannon though the truth is
I'm used to handling standing tall strong like wall paneling
All from Maryland spreaded my chips
To them stores on Madison my fetish for chicks but umm


Starting fresh, building slow, take my time cause now...I know



Yeah, its rap now and I still ask how
Still got the vibe guess I got to be live
Gear so illy gotta stay fly
Appear so willy hunnies got to say hi
But wave by cause I'm gone in the wind
Errol Flynn blue Pradas pearl Benz few dollars girlfriend you holla
My focus on never so often you could catch me with some loafers on
I'm livin its all vision cautious decisions
From the cost to the Porsche with the ribbons
My ambitions embedded deep down in my soul
I don't fold I'm forever like diamonds and gold a smoke's scroll
Bottles and buckles of ice I'm on the mic and ya'll thought little Weezy was nice
Get a load of a lyricist duckin his mows
Street influences doin this since 12 years old but oh...




So I'm back ya'll
Back from black ball
Back with the mask off
Could rap my ass off
Past paused then ducked the task force
Tough as the asphalt
Stuffed the cash vault its my fault
Cause I seen it coming I guess I couldn't see me running still stunning
Name still the same in humming since a younging
Been feeding through illegal funding call it cunning
Done with my days of dumming I'm grown up
Calisthenics in the gym on the daily I'm toned up
And ya'll cowards gon respect my work my word
I'm worldwide with a thirst unheard yes sir...

Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cuz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin, ain't no crippin
Ain't no punk ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission


Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide, slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high


I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left


Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive

Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45


Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot, swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin' everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by?
You better be ready so you can ride


Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage

Just roll along 
Just roll along

I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky
I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky
Every since huffy, pockets on husky
Shawty don't trust me, I break hearts often
If you look at my pockets you a weight watcher
From a dishwasher to a kingpin
Remember how the scene end and how this thing is
Drugs backed in 'em mean them things in
Now it's duffle bags full of green men
I swear I ain't lying if my daddy hadn't died
He’d tell ya I had em' hooked like Kareem did
Two kids later, I mature like fine wine in the basement
Vino, different kind of pinot
Tried to stack c-note after c-note
I'm tryna make it count like a free throw at the free throw
Line, it's a thin one between
Getting high and committing crimes, let a nigga live
I've been locked up more rapping than I did tryna get a brick



I remember when I believed in me
What am I supposed to do?
Uh, now when the ones that didn't see me
They want a verse or two
Shit, what am I supposed to do?
Put 'em in a fucking hearse or two
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
Well at least until the pizza came
Or at least until polices came
Undercovers outside my momma yard
And all the guns is in Kesha's name
In Jesus's name I pray
I say that a couple times a day
When it's time to eat, when it's time to lay
And when it's daytime it ain't my time of day, uh


I heard my little big cousin mad at me
I call him little big cause he younger than me
But he big, he was the high school team captain
Didn't graduate but sometimes things happen
And whatever happen that was the worst day
And who know what was going on in the first place
I love and helped raise my nigga
This year forgot to call him on his birthday
It's hard to explain my new lifestyle
A partner lockdown, got a phone and an iPod
He called to tell me happy new years
I had to tell him nigga, it's March
We had similar stars, but I ain't figured his part
They had dough and we didn't
How did it dissolve, alka-seltzer
This is the outroduction
Niggas stab you in your back like acupuncture

Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up

Call me Mr. East Coast motherfucker
Let me give them a friendly reminder real quick, yo


Y'all already know the god gotta talk
Every single time I come you niggas know I gotta do it
Yes I gotta do it and I gotta kill 'em and I gotta hit 'em
Yes you know a nigga gotta beat 'em stupid
Only got 41 seconds just to give a nigga shit
Every second bitch I gotta use it
Somewhat a nigga blew it and I cannot
Grab the microphone and not make a motherfucker lose it
And I make niggas jump in the back
Niggas up, she in the back of the truck
Lil' mommy wanna fuck and she really wanna suck
When I finish with it then we go in the back of the club
And we do this shit again my nigga, pronto
Bip-de-badda-de-booda-de-beat it like a bongo
Banging on the pussy like a nigga named Alonzo
Head game crazy, that make her the head honcho
Mad cause I took his bitch and now he thinks he macho?
Somebody better call the cops yo
'Fore we run up inside of that nigga's lil' condo
Put him in a box so the nigga in a cargo 
Shut a nigga down 
Throw a bottle at ya, shut a nigga mouth 
Come and follow me, stand up on the couch 
Let us wallow, niggas know we're in the house 
East Coast nigga!


10031 is where my zip is
Live in Har-ar-lem, up in the trenches
Run through a bodega like I ain't got riches
Run through a bodega like I ain't got 
Don't do it for the haters, I do it for the bitches
My flow Al-Qaeda, I kill rap niggas
Y'all Now and Laters, sweet ass-niggas
Soon as you get famous, they wanna ass-kiss 
Only thing that I'm missing is Hov verse 
I get a feeling, they want the old Ferg
""Cocaine Castle"", ""Hood Pope"" Ferg
Got a question to ask you: do you know Ferg?
Do you know that I come from where the toast burn?
New York, New York, 143rd
On Hungry Ham up on the corner
Fiends gangster lean, they never sober
From being in the streets to run a culture
I never been in the weave, I had hoes, bruh
Who's that jiggy motherfucker with the clothes, bruh?
I'm finna kill these motherfuckers with the flow, bruh
I'm the best in the game with the flow, bruh
In New York I Milly Rock to ""Magnolia""
I love the East but shoutout to every coast, bruh
South to North and even West Coast, bruh


Blackin' like I'm fresh up out retirement, my flow still monumental
Mental, couldn't ride an instrumental but they ridin' dick
I set the standards for requirements, so call the firemen
Just me, myself and I, the world is mine, I put the ""I"" in his
His posse too clean , his diamonds like TIP 
His skin too clear , his bitch gon' stare 
So mind your biz, how they find the time for minding mine
I find these college chicks for top with Kylie's lips
Oh my, oh my 
Run it, run it like you want it 
Run it, run it like you stole it 
Running, running like I'm going 
Running, pitching like I'm bowling 
In my city, gangs run the inner city
Load a semi for the chiddy bang
Flacko, Fergie, Frenchie with the bitties
Hit up Remy for the pretty gang


Lately I feel like a Beatle
I'm Paulie McCartney just rocking Moschino
Moscato or Pinot
I got some bitches to hop in the Regal
Phenomenal deep throat
I'm more Ali than Muhammad
My noodles was Ramen, go Google my diamonds
I got some shooters in college
I feel like a coach, I'm recruiting and signing
Look, I still be moving in silence
I'm ballin' in blue like I'm hooping in Dallas 
Bitch I don't play for no Mavericks
You need to think who gon' pay for your casket
Ignorant bastard
But I'm still conscious enough to give hope to the masses
Watch the coke do gymnastics
Dominique Dawes, foreign my car when I'm mashin'


Chain busting it down, wrist busting it down
Your bitch busting it down, Rap game I'm fucking it now
I could be a jeweler, neck that's Slick the Ruler
You niggas is comedy, talking fast like Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
KRS-One, Big L flows, son of a gun with the Buffalo
Head on my wrist is a P1, made more money than E1 
One time Chinx, two time Yams 
Get the money, slide like a violin 
You know my nigga Max almost home? 
You know who run the East Coast zone nigga?


In the kitchen, culinary, I could whip a Bloody Mary
And I wish that blood would dead me, I'ma get ya brother buried
Gangbanging with your halo, business on the payphone
Bitches pussies drying up, like Taz's Angels
Never was a client, 'cause that boy ain't buying it
And I got a bottom bitch, my top come on consignment
Step up from the minor league, double M the dynasty
No, I never sold dope, I just got me a finder's fee
Following my frequency, niggas rapping week to week
Suckers be so weak to me, text, but don't speak to me
You can never speak for me, see the B.I. chemistry
Check into the crazy house, I'ma turn the labels out


Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up

But I know this West Coast 


10/20 was my date of birth, the day I came to Earth
Bottle-sipping, love to burp, young nigga that's doing dirt
Long Beach across my shirt, all y'all niggas gon' get merked
What the fuck is you talkin' bout?
Me and Ferg, we gon put in work
Bang on ya' gang culture, out of this world
It's all on a bitch, is she a Blood? Is she a Crip?
Don't slip, think not, on the block where it's hot
Legalize with the nines, give a fuck about a cop
Real shit, this is it, from the bottom to the Bay
This is anybody K, California all day
Yes-sir, on the curb, Mossberg by the van
Little homies on the roof with the blam, blam, blam!

"I got lost on the road somewhere
Was it Texas or was it Canada
Drinking whiskey in the morning light
I work the stage all night long
At first we laughed about it
My long-haired drunken friends
Proposed a toast to Jimmy's ghost
I never dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end

I'm stuck here on the inside looking out
I'm just another case
Where's my makeup where's my face on the inside

All got your kicks from what you saw up there
Eight bucks even buys a folding chair
I was downing seagrams on another flight
And I worked that stage all night long
You were screaming for the villain up there
And I was much obliged
The old road sure screwed me good this time
It's hard to see where the vicious circle ends

I'm stuck here on the inside looking out
That's no big disgrace
Where's my makeup where's my face on the inside

Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
Settle down with just what they need
Livin' on love
She don't care 'bout what's in style
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
Livin' on love


Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin' on love
It sounds simple, that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love


Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side in that front porch swing
Livin' on love
He can't see anymore
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
Just livin' on love

Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime

Drew Barry or Halle Berry
Or in between
As long as I'm in between
It’s badabo badabing


I want this forever
Just you in the grotto
Nothin' but your nights on
Keep the fuckin' lights on
Same again tomorrow
We don't need no bottle
Purple-colored lipgloss
Room at The Saguaro
Ain't nowhere I would rather be
Right between your holidays
Coffee on the flintstone
Jewelry on the ottoman
Baby, let me in
‘Fore I get way too adamant about it
Love the way you shiver
Dig into my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Harrelson and Juliet
Legends never die
The TV hasn't worked in ages
Probably got a shorted cable
Way too busy fucking on the sofa or the kitchen table
Is my vision hazy?
You look like you're someone famous

You send ‘em my direction and it’s Santa Clara Diet
I am not afraid of no one
You smoke that poison ivy
Girl, I whip it, go the distance
Then I kiss it 'cause they have it
50 First Dates , hit it then skate 
Get it with a real one, why you always fakin'?
I don't got no patience
I don't got no shame, man
I don't play no games
'Cause if I like you, I'ma say that
Aggressive and I'm playful
That's a perfect balance though
I'm from where that Solbiato choppers and New Balance go
This is my Landover flow
Killin', had them rollers though
I would buy me everything with credit card from MoCO hoes

Another lonely name etched in the stone
On a wall, in a cell, with a prisoners bone
As the night drags its fingers over our eyes
So too do my fingers trace these outlines


Lights out, lights out
And the concrete slowly works its way into a man's heart


Real world rules, no missing evidence
Real world rules, no prison break
Real world rules, no tunnels to freedom
Innocence was here, innocence was here


Someone else's fail has cost your life
What happens now when the doors have slammed shut?
Lights out, lights out till we think only with barbed wire brain cells
And dream only of some long-ago life


Lights out, lights out as the screamers begin their lament
In voices long shredded with fear and regret
And the natural born killers
Rest peaceful in their violent sleep


Real world rules, no missing evidence
Real world rules, no prison break
Real world rules, no tunnels to freedom
Innocence was here, innocence was here


And when somebody else's fingers have traced
The initials I've carved, carved into the stone
There was no prison break, there was no escape
Someone else's mistake


There was no prison break, there was no escape
I was innocent all along


Real world rules, no missing evidence
Real world rules, no prison break
Real world rules, no tunnels to freedom
Innocence was here, innocence was here


No missing evidence
No prison break
No tunnels to freedom
Innocence was here, innocence was here

Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely
Baby with a lonely kind of life to lead
Her mammy was lusted, Daddy he was busted
They left her to be trusted 'til the orphan bleeds


But when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane


Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby
That she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see
But soon she found her mother's love for all the others
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead


But when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane, ow!


Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah




Now she's doing any for money and a penny
A sailor with a penny or two or three
Hers is the cunning for men who come a-running
They all come for fun and it seems to me


That when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane


Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window

Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear

And the sun again will shine bright and clear

Tho' the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always

In slow motion, I watch you fall

I think you'll change, but you never do
You never do, I enable you

Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget

Something different, something brave
Wish I would, but I never could

I try to help, but it's sink or swim
And you're a weight - there's comfort in pain

Now I know fools get their own when they chit chat
Haven’t heard yet, but you can bet I’m not with that
With that talk, with the digi walk
I struck a bird, you heard, absurd, word to the fact
I’m a cat, nippin’, sippin’ on the flask
Passin’ it, talkin’ shit, but only if you’re an ass
In front of me cuz you could run from me but
In the end, revenge send ends to the defendant
I can’t get caught in the spiral
Cuz every bit of energy, it goes to my survival
Out my way, I’m a flicka flacka blotter
Ya try to find a weakness, but the shit keeps gettin’ harder

Fourth of July
With Lucy in sky
I remember pine trees and the coat of many colors
I was nineteen
I’d do anything
Shit like that now scares me, but I’d like to do it again
It was Independence Day
I’ve seen the other side and I say
Oh, I’ve been insane
And I won’t ever be the same

 S.A Martinez
Cuz we flow we must be fly
First to flow, Nick, oh my brother, so wise
And then I rise
Here’s an ill kid pimpin’ cuz he is so slick
Steps from darkness, his body electric
A drone buzzes the air, a cracklin’ tone
Then boomin’ like thunder in a cosmic jungle
Death defyin’ like Evil Knievel
Words that will wobble awkwards and evil
Cuz he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds
A marvel pow, how you like me now
I’ve returned the kiss of death, the last Damien
From the abyss, a fresh eternal alien
Now famished from pathless ways, I’ma do damage
To the wack MCs, I know you can’t stand this
Right about now, get down, I’m the annihilator
Rockin’ with the rhythm of my rhyme detonator

What'll it be?, he asked, What do you need tonight?
Something cold to drown the fire, something hot to stir one up?
I'll make it simple, I said, Just two things I'll request
That bottle by your shoulder and some quarters for these dollars

Cause


If you want to make me happy, pour me Bourbon on the rocks
And play every sad song on the jukebox


Songs of loving and leaving, lying and cheating
Songs of hurting and crying and even songs of dying




A woman, he asked
She left you I bet, I've seen that look that's in your eyes
On a many other face, ""That's right"" I said, I deserved it I guess
But it still hurts me all alone at night, there by myself

This is what they want, huh?


Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money-gettin' niggas
Need my assistance to stack figures, beyond non-existence
Fuck keepin' my distance, 'cause bein' poor produced persistence
Plus pleas, a hundred G's will have me blockin' out of jail sentence
I'm recognized by the illest of individuals, killers and criminals
Even willies that's really into jewels
But still skeptic on who I cling to
'Cause every single nigga that swing through ain't my man just 'cause we mingle
Too much snake shit, even females be feedin' off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it
Temporarily, though it don't worry me
The wise verbally nourish me
Properly with that inner-city urban G, see
I fuck with those beyond my age bracket
'Cause they analyze and map it, get the papers and stack it
Leavin' no trace to track it, kingpin thinkin' tactics is accurate
That mack shit, livin' the lifestyle, we feel relaxed with


Give me 
Give me , give me what you can't give back 
Give me 
Why don't you give me the world 
Give me what you can't give back, back, back, back


So in God I trust, I lust for a Bugatti deluxe
And until I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Louis Vuitton down with lizards
It's realism, so I visualize it to live it
Movin' cleverly, with intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin' papers others would never see, G
So through the crest in my glow of fluorescence
Symbolizes the essence, you're sailin' in a schweppervescence
Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance
But informers'll have you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enormous
Life's a performance, so players play with endurance
'Cause for more cents, any villain's willin' to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
'Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough


Give me 
Give me, give me what you can't give back 
Give me 
Why don't you give me the world

"Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night
With bruised arms and broken rhythm in a beat-up old Buick
But dressed just like dynamite
He tried selling his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street
But they sighed ""Johnny it falls apart so easy
And you know hearts these days are cheap""
And the pimps swung their axes and said
""Johnny you're a cheater""
Well the pimps swung their axes and said
""Johnny you're a liar""
And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice
Said, ""Johnny don't cry""
Puerto Rican Jane, oh won't you tell me what's your name
I want to drive you down to the other side of town
Where paradise ain't so crowded
There'll be action going down on Shanty Lane tonight
All them golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch fight
Pull .38s and kiss the girls good night

Oh good night, it's alright Jane
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame
We may find it out on the street tonight baby
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe

Well like a cool Romeo he made his moves
Oh she looked so fine
Like a late Juliet she knew he'd never be true
But then she didn't really mind
Upstairs a band was playing
The singer was singing something about going home
She whispered, ""Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight
But just don't leave me alone""

And Johnny cried ""Puerto Rican Jane
Word is down the cops have found the vein""
Oh them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods
Them little barefoot street boys they say homes ain't no good
They left the corners
Threw away all their switchblade knives
And kissed each other good-bye

Johnny was sitting on the fire escape
Watching the kids playing down the street
He called down ""Hey little heroes
Summer's long but I guess it ain't very sweet around here anymore""
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on
And the sister prays for lost souls
Then breaks down in the chapel after everyone's gone

Jane moves over to share her pillow
But opens her eyes to see Johnny up and putting his clothes on
She says ""Those romantic young boys
All they ever want to do is fight""
Those romantic young boys
They're calling through the window
""Hey Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?""
And Johnny whispered:
Good night, it's all tight Jane
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane
We may find it out on the street tonight baby
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe

Ah good night, it's all right Jane
I'm gonna meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane
Ah we can find it out on the street tonight baby
Or we may walk until the daylight maybe

Ah, good night, it's all right Jane
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane
Now we may find it out on, on the street tonight baby
Or we may have to walk until the morning light maybe

Snow white too, wanted to get rocked

Bitch watch out I'm about to conspire
He told me to kill you, cause your life I shall acquire
Cause Satan says, you're making him perspire
Which is why your torment is required
Cause deep down in hell, there is no purifier
Cause golden goddess you'd be the perfect qualifier
Your soul burning I shall always admire
Cause the heat you release gets me inspired
To kill the rap game until the day I expire

I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard-headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me


Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live


Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous
Who's that peekin' in my window
With a pistol to my curtains?


Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I'll live


Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six


Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long

I've been wrong before
And I'll be there again
I don't have any answers my friend
Just this pile of old questions
My memory left me here
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
I'm going back to my house
But I'm not going now
It's too early
To be leaving here, somehow
Let me bore you with this story
""How my lover let me down""
While I borrow seeds of sadness
From the ground


In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again
There ain't no way of telling
Where these seeds will rise or when
I'll just wait around until springtime
And then, I'll find a friend
In the field of opportunity
It's plowing time again


When I'm all done cultivating
I'll be rocking on the porch
Trying to picture
You and where you are
And there'll be no hesitating
When Cupid lights the torch
With those headlights coming down the hill
Between the stars

You called it quits and hung up the phone
Now go love the one you choose
And my friends say I should be happy
But if I'm happy, this is a good imitation of the blues


You've threatened to leave one too many times
I'm getting out-a traveling shoes
And now that you are gone, I'm gonna be walking home
With this good imitation of the blues


My friends, all say you're no good without me
And they tell me that's good for you
And they say that I'm just doing fine
This good imitation of the blues

I remember we were on the bleachers sharing secrets when we look up, it'd be ""Where did the time go?""
And I remember you would hold my hand and call me baby while we dancing in the parking lot so slow


Bittersweet, those memories
When I see, you with her now


And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart to see you happy, without me


Oh I remember we would stay up late after the game look at the stars up in the sky in the nighttime
And I remember when you used to call me in the morning just to see if I was good and I slept right


Bittersweet,  those memories 
When I see,  you with her now


And it breaks my heart, yeah it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart to see you happy


Yeah, I remember when we would cut class
Go to the park, just sit in the grass
Send me the spark 'cause I light up the gas
Telling you that I'm ahead anyway
I wish the feelings would just go away
I still be thinkin' 'bout you to this day
Sometimes I call you from private and just remain silent 'cause I do not know what to say 
I know you stuck with the pain 
I feel so f-- ashamed 
Girl let's be honest I told you, I promise that I wouldn't do it again 
I know you stuck in your ways 
So much just push me away 
Now that I got a new flame
Glad that we're feeling the same yeah


But the sun will come again 
Maybe one day in the future 
You'll come runnin' right back again

Maybe one day in the future

But I feel a little bit dumb, just a little bit sprung
Just a little too late
Oh you call up those other chicks
I can't stop thinking it's lame missing you anyway


And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart to see you happy, without me
 And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart to see you happy, without me
I feel a little bit dumb, just a little bit sprung, just a little too late

Going to move you to the rhythm until you never can stop

Total insubordination
Complete revolt, formal sabotage
Still it must be stressed that on this port
There is no room for compromise
Faint, all our crime is crime of physical setting
Except inside the mind 
How come more and more futile
The American dream is the fertilize? 
Nothing at all can be expected
Except for the use of violence
Nothing at all cvan be changed if
Evolution turned us to silence
Confrontations clearing the way
Will be opening

And the coke price too when the D's make a bust

Everything you worked for, they come to take it all
Man it's like they don't know what they taking
Hit you with the tazer, I'll have you sizzling like bacon
When you pray say a prayer for me, a nigga could use it
Through my pain there's a piece of me in all of my music
Go head you can judge me, I'm hoping you love me
I see I got it mastered, muh muh muh magic

Before we pop up on that ass with toasters

Forgive me for that line and the rest of my sins

Yes, I'm insane! Put you in pain
My mind has been trained to live in the fastlane!
Should I slow down? - Fuckin' speed up!
You better take a hit from my weed you need some!

Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one! 
Break one, jack one, save one, get one! 
""Rise up""! ""Rise Up""! Take me higher!

We lead by example! - You know that we are showin' proof
Gonna beat them whose are over you beat down overdue!

I will be the wind that echo's on the canyon wall
One more day with you, to walk around our neighbourhood
We will never know like it was understood


We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light


If you've given up, I will call an end to this
I will be your rock from our perch
If you walk the ridge, you will find the marks, the scars
Kneel down by the tree, under the city stone


We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

We never say goodbye
I'll see you on this side
Or the other way
The desert sun kisses the sky
Baby hold the light
And keep it in your eyes
And promise that you dream with me
Beyond the walls of time
And when we laid aside
Just look up at the light


Just let me hold the light
Just let me hold the light

I was listening to the sound of the waves breaking
And I thought of all the words that they were whispering
And it kept changing
I was standing in the midst of a great company
Listening to the voices in ecstasy
And I watched as all creation was sang into being
And it kept changing
And it was changing

And all at once I caught a pulse and felt a rhythm
And I thought of the song of the ages
Then the balance slipped and opened up the season
And I felt like raging

I was staring at the clouds, the rain began to fall softly
Filling up the rivers in Texas
And I thought of you and maybe you once thought of me
We were changing
And we kept changing

And all at once I saw a hole into the future
And I thought of the bells of creation
I heard the voice of God coming in the music
And I felt like Satan
And I felt like Satan

We were standing on the shore, facing an open sea
Listening the sound of the waves breaking
And I turned to you and said ""we should never leave""

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""


Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever


I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns


Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever


I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between

My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love


Do you remember how when you were younger

Hold that feeling forever

My friend, this life we live
Is not what we have, it's what we believe

It's not my time
I'm not going

It's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh, It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
Now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh, I won't go
I won't go

It might be more than you believe
It might be something you can't see

It's not my time

This could be the end of me
And everything I know

Now it's gonna show
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
I won't go

There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you can see

It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me

They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you 


Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

Fill me up
Then pour me out

We had the same feelings at opposite times

Can't find the good in each other
Then a good man and a good woman
Will bring out the worst in the other
The bad in each other, oh

To find us now
When we've become two
Fluorescently blue
Down the neon river
The sadness canoes
Either without or with her

"Non ti vedevo da quel giorno
Non ci speravo piu ormai
Ieri sera quando sei salita su da me
E sulla porta mi hai baciato
Il mio cuore si e fermato
E intanto che morivo
Pensavo ai giorni perduti
Vissuti senza di noi

Nei giorni che tu non c'eri
Vivevo con un'altra
Era stupenda
Come sei tu
Lei giocava con i suoi modi
Per attirarmi
E io l'amavo
Sempre di piu

Ma poi si sa
Succede che
Troppo sicuri si e di se;
Ed era compito di lei
Farsi piacere da me ma dopo un po'
Lei comincio
A trascurare quel suo far
Che mi faceva innamorar
Come facesti tu con me

Non ti ricordi quando noi
Coglievamo un po' d'insalata e tu
Con la gonna blu
Ti abbassavi apposta...
Davanti a me
Tu lo facevi
Volevi che io ti guardassi
E io ti guardavo li sull'insalata
Poi ci amavamo

Ma poi la favola fini
E l'insalata ingialli
La gonna blu
Tu non ti mettevi piu
Preferivi imprigionare
Le tue curve
In una tuta
Militare. ma ora che sei qui
Con la gonna blu;
Non lasciarmi piu, Non toglierti la gonna...
Non togliertela piu...

But you're in bed
Stumble out
And run dead
If it ever paid
To self start

Just another victim

But not before
Begging off
And livin' bored
My hands are tied
Webbed feet again
Fell in behind
And claim us dead

In spite of truth
Give it up
I'll lie to you
Blame and flame this

Pointed finger
You fall apart



You played yourself now you point the finger
How i've robbed and raped ya, bruised and scraped ya
But those are just lies, cause in your eyes you've been victimized
It's how you size it up, you disguise it up, and try to make it look
Real
To cover up the low self esteem you feel
Introspection an afterthought, swimmin in guilt your favorite sport
But now you're caught up in the undertow
You never knew a man could sink so low
But now you know, cause you're John Doe
In a black bag a tag on your toe
I built the House
I felt the Pain
You're victimized but got no one to blame

And the only way not to drown is not to fight it
When you're falling down the stairs with your superstitions and despair
On a helter skelter fall to your demise

What I could have given if you'd given half a chance

Cast a stone in a grave of the plans that you made
They only go as far as you can thrown them

But what could make a man wanna walk around the schoolyard with his tool hard
And what could make the switch to call a girl a bitch
It probably happened when you first started rappin’
And when you know that you were stuck with Beavis
Now leave us on a note of positivity
I’m saying this for levity but if I leave it brief I call it brevity
I said I see the people rocking, which means there’s no stopping the flow
And you can just tell ‘em that you know

Come on, every night yeah we turnin’ up
And comin’ off live like a final 311 battle breaking idols
On the one you never heard before
You know the hard-core rockin’ pumpin’ the dance floor
Leave ya feet sore looking for your Micatin
You know the mic is deadly in the mood we into

Every time the enemy hear us they will be shakin’

To cast a swift embracing glance
Like lightning flashing in the sky
But there's a charm that is greater still:
When my love's eyes are lowered
When all is fired by passions kiss

Black days of winter all were through
The blossoms came and they brought you
Clouds left the sky and I knew the reason why
They made way for you and the blossom and the blossom


The seasons cycle turned again
An April shower now and then
Trees came alive, bees left their hive
They came out to see you and the blossom and the blossom


People were laughing, smiling with the sun
They knew that summer had begun


The days grew warm, the nights grew warm
Spring turned to summer and was gone
It seemed so fine, the cider and the wine
But I knew you'd go with the blossom with the blossom


When spring returns I'll look again
To find another blossom friend
Until I do, find something new
I'll just think of you and the blossom and the blossom

'Cause I was crying right along with you
If the heavens may break, I hope for our sake
That if they ever do, I'll be there with you

I said ""Help, won't you help me now
And lift me up if my legs give out?""

And living is the hardest part
And someplace through the dark
We will meet and never part

While bad news waits for you to wake
We all kneel down before the storm
When waves come crashing at your door

And I have faith, but I need more
We're specks of dust caught in a whirlwind
Nothingness behind the curtain
Life is short, but death is certain
That will always be our burden

See through the dark
We will meet and never part

I swear he's out to get me
Oh, I swear he's out to get me


I'll change that station
Light it up like the 4th of July
It's me, I'm caller fifteen
But it's too late for explanations
This broadcast will be your last


Come one, come all
You're just in time to witness my first breakdown
'Cause there's a mile gone for every minute passed
When I'm wasting space in this town
Don't call the doctors, I don't need no medication
I just need one more vacation and make it last


Hear me out, please, judge and jury
And I swear he's out to get me
Oh, I swear he's out to get me
Go on and lock me up
You better throw away that key
I swear he's out to get me
Oh, I swear he's out to get me
I've got a bone to pick with you, Mr. DJ
You really ought to lock me up
Because your playlist is killing me


Come one, come all
You're just in time to witness my first breakdown
'Cause there's a mile gone for every minute passed
When I'm wasting space in this town
Don't call the doctors, I don't need no medication
I just need one more vacation and make it last

Player haters want to see me killed
Only real niggas stay on top
All these niggas is mad at me

Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman, nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin' cop cars, look at how we come so far
Picture a high school drop-out rollin a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me – can't
Never visioned livin' longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out, or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change, it comes with the fame
Watch for gossip and the silly games
To all the motherfuckers speakin' down on me, this is the night
Why's everybody caught up in Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas
Why y'all conversatin' in my life?

"There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green
He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing
Of the water weeds
While she was busy being free

There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
He calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same
He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaly towers
Of a forest tree
While she was somewhere being free

There's a man who's sent a letter
And he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels
Since the day they said goodbye
He writes ""Wish you were beside me
We can make it if we try""
He has seen her at the office
With her name on all his papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her
From his memory
And she's so busy being free

There's a lady in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl
She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her
For eternity
And she's so busy being free

There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
There's a drummer and a dreamer
And you know there may be more
She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow
Like a cactus tree
While she's so busy being free

Like a cactus tree
Being free

When it's dark outside and I can't say no more
Try to fight the world alone
I am lost silence and nobody knows
Then I, I remember when we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
And we, we would conquer them one by one
But tonight, let's stand alone


Nobody sees me, now I'm a one man show
I'll do this alone
We knew it all, but right now I just don't know
Guess I'm heading home now


Now I know I couldn't stay
Had a million words, didn't know what to say

And the devil took it, I faded away
But I still remember when we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
And we, we would conquer them one by one

Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin' hands
'long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight
I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light


And they dance like spirits in the night  in the night 
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night , in the night 
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you


Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, ""Try some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt,"" she said, ""Honey, let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can


She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night 
In the night , Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night , in the night 
Stand right up and let her shoot through me




Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right


Together we moved like spirits in the night, all night

One evening for pleasure I rambled to view
The fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron
Where beauty and pleasure were known


I spied a fair maid at her labour
Which caused me to stay for a while
And I thought of a goddess to beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle


I humbled myself to her beauty
""Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne?""


""Young man, I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure


Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle.""


""Young maiden I wish not to banter
It's true I come here in disguise
I came here to fulfill our last promise
And hope to give you a surprise


I've known you're a maid I love dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle.""

What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old


We talk about art then end up on sex
We text for hours, you're so complex
Not your average girl in spandex
Who chase Bent-e-leys and Rolex
You wear them baggy jeans like Aaliyah
Your body so mean, I can tell you got a booty like Selena
Girl, you're 'bout to have me catch a fever
I can't lie, I get happy every time a nigga see ya
The way you move, the way you groove
Is so appealing
I'm usually not that dude caught up in all these feelings
I've been around the world and dealt with all these women
Through all these different girls, this is the realest feeling


I'm tired of the waiting 
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely 
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it


What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old


Sort of afrocentric, you been thick
Pearly white teeth like you live at the dentist
Impeccable freckle, you put a spell on niglet
Room full of syringes, she got me addicted
Body authentic, how do you bend it?
Got her too tempted
I don't know how to prevent it
I will go into it, party 'til I go limp dick
Run in that clitoris, like I'm in the Olympics
Swinging that diznick, til it's all in appendix
She be likin' it nasty, I like when you rinse it
Rinse it off like candy rain
Say my name three times like Candyman
Oh, cause our love so so real
That a nigga want to score like Shaquille O'Neal
And she fly like an eagle, so I call her Seal
Let nothing get in between what you feel


I'm tired of the waiting 
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely 
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it


What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling

See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every girl in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how it's looking, babe


Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say ""Speed it up"", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
So why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

I didn't feel so bad
Well she covered me with roses
Put my hands on my feet

I pull my meat
Well, the gang's all here
And I'm feeling fine
Ah ah, It was a moan it was a smack
It was a countdown
Oh, it was a downtown

All is going good
I forgot my rubber

All I want to do is get on my feet
Na, no...oh, the boy's coming home
Because your face looking kind a dead inside
Lord see her moan again
And won't you dance some more
More more

Road narrows, pouring down
I'm breaking without a sound
Bits and pieces of trying
Get what you pay for, nothing

Frozen dreaming of yesterday
Potent, creeping I'm far away
From my hometown I lit out
To save my skin and shed some doubt


I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down that road before
It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself


Hard as truth is, been my friend
Don't need to be invited in
I'll go round 'til bested
Pick up myself and try again


I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down that road before
It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself


All comes in time
Don't fight it, don't mind it
Whatever may come


I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down both roads before
It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself

Left Laredo with the sun in my eyes
Broken heart and a bloodshot sky
Been running since she left me alone
Way up north in San Antone
Days get long but I don't get far
Spent last night in some low life bar
Found her memory in some Mezcal haze
Lost my mind while the guitar played


I'm going to carry this burden way out west
Find a way to lay this hurt to rest
Live it up until I live her down
Lost in tequila town


Left her standing in a tear-stained dress
I cursed the day that I confessed
Wayward sins of a mortal man
Watched the ring come off her hand
Looking back on all I've lost
Price I've paid ain't worth the cost
I'll run this road until it ends
And maybe find my way back to her again

She can't do this anymore
She bought a ticket west and left me staring down the storm
Now I'm sittin' here all alone
In an empty house that used to be a happy home
She said she needed sunshine
She had enough of clouds
I knew it wouldn't take too long for her to figure out


It don't rain in California
You won't see a single storm cloud in the sky
It's always clear, so there won't be any tears
Leave you standin' in the downpour trying to hide
It don't rain in California like it's raining here tonight


I can't do this anymore
I hopped a plane and I found my way to the California shore
Now we're sittin' here all alone
You knew that I was comin', you sounded happy on the phone
I knew you needed sunshine
It seems I brought the clouds
The thunder and the lightning seem to follow me around


It don't rain in California
You won't see a single storm cloud in the sky
It's always clear, so there won't be any tears
That you're standin' in the downpour trying to hide
'Cause it don't rain in California like it's raining here tonight

Questo Sabato e triste
Per me
La mia donna non c'e
Forse e in cerca di qualcosa
Che non trova in me
E bob mi fara mangiar
Mi si e chiusa la gola
Perche
Vorrei piangere gia
Anche se qualcosa avessi da mangiar
Non la vorrei, perche lei
Non c'e

La picchio davvero
Deve capire che cosi no non va
Deve capire che al Sabato un uomo
Non puo restare senza donna e digiuno

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made


But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

We're stars and we're beautiful


She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within


There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful


No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful


There's a hope that's waiting for you

We're stars and we're beautiful

I sit around and watch the tube, but nothin's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fuckin' lazy


Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind and I smell like shit


Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key


Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind and I smell like shit


I got no motivation, where is my motivation?
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration


I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job, but she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely


Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise

And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes, I'm trippin' away to paradise

Step by step
We trudge on
On this scarlet road
Adrift and immured
Keen and uncured
Grimly walking the will of the one


One foot in front of the other one
On this steep road paved with our blood
Step by step we march a long walk
And breath by breath we just plough on


And I long to wake
Come up for air


But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand


One truth after the other one
Given and served we swallow down
Day by day we drink the blood of our sons
So they will walk this road again


But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand


Whitedreaming
One, two! One, two! Forlorn, march!
Linewalking


Lift your eyes
I can see the light
March on, march on
Lift your eyes
You can see it too
March on voidwards

I can see the light
March on, we march on

You can see it too

And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet
And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
And dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for


And this is the room one afternoon, I knew I could love you
And from above you how I sank into your soul
Into that secret place where no one dares to go
And your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die

You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On Our Lady of the Harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

The green hills, the silver stream
Can you not see the newborn sky, the auburn sun
You are so near the sun of the dawn


Across the waves of the fever sea
The lashing billows hurling curses at me
Bawling the cormorant mouths open wide
Snatching and gnawing, bane at my side

Deathwards the ferry glides across the waters so deep
To the foul land, athwart the venomous sea
Resistance worn down and a broken will
A crippled heart, sense come to nil


Can you feel it, can you hear it
The oaks song, the raven's call
Can you not see the newborn sky, the auburn sun
You are so near the sun of the dawn


Can you feel them, can you see them
The green hills, the silver stream
Can you not see the newborn sky, the auburn sun
Can you not see the sun of the dawn
You are so near tir' jovincon

Dangerous love
You're no good for me, darling
Yeah, you turn me away
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me
I get a chill inside
And nothing frightens me, baby, more


Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried?
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry and cry?


So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay


You're a dangerous love
Maybe you're no good for me, darling
Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I'd rather you leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
Ooh, you're a dangerous love, oh

Our home was silent and so sad
Dad took sick and had to leave us
I have no home No mother nor dad

There's a little lonesome grave yard
On these tomestones it did say
On mother's ""gone but not forgotten""
On dad's ""we'll meet again someday""

I often go out to the graveyard
Where they laided them down to rest
I can almost hear them whisper
Trust in god He'll do the rest

Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they'll dwell with god above
Where they'll meet there friends and loved ones
And share with all his precious love

This concrete’s too cold to be walking on it
Oh yes, walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I’d be living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here but alright
Hurt somebody, oh I have to hurt somebody, alright
Hurt somebody, oh I have to hurt somebody, alright
Hurt somebody, oh I have to hurt somebody, alright

My mama need a crib, son need some Jordan’s
This some bullshit, cause I can’t afford it
Band’s listening and the band record it
Trying to flush the pen hoping I survive the morning
It’s getting hot-hot, man I’m talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Dancing in no pop trying to stick my fork in
Want her on the block? Then you got to put your work in




Brother need bail, stead calling
Dreaming out the cell, till he wake up in the morning
Magic warp, always disappears
Smoked got my eyes blurred
But my vision clear
Hot head, but this concrete cold
Titanium bitch i never fold
Never judge a nigga before you judge yourself
You ain’t got to help me
Nigga help yourself
Nigga up in here
I don’t know what they told him
Well tell them I’m the mob
I don’t own them
I’ll take you to the sharks
They can't breathe out the water
I’ll tear your ass apart and put you out of order

Never seen time fly like I did this morning
When I threw that alarm clock 'cross the room
Pried one eye open and the man in the mirror
Said, ""Son, what you doin' up so soon?""
Brewed a couple eggs, put bacon in the blender
Coffee over-easy is a bad idea
Day just stared and I'm ready to surrender
Even through this fog it's clear


It's gonna be a long day
Headed the wrong way
At this rate I'll be lucky if I get to work by ten
And I'll fight through the pain
Do my best to explain
I wasn't out too late, just up too early again


 down and bought a bean burrito
That might've been the mother of 
With one bite left I looked down and saw my wrist watch
Oh my God, nearly missed my break!
Dad caught me packin' up my tools at 4:30
Hollered ""Son, where you think you're headed to?
You ain't worked a lick and your hands ain't even dirty
You ain't goin' nowhere 'til the job is through""


It's a long day
Still headed the wrong way
At this rate I'll be lucky if I get off of work by ten
But I fight through the pain
And do my best to explain
I wasn't out too late, just up too early again


It's half-past dark
There won't be a place to park
If I don't make some 
Gotta get home, get showered, get changed
Lord, let there be a clean shirt on the rack


It's a long day
Finally headed the right way
At this rate I'll be lucky if I make it to the bar by ten
I have fought through the pain
Tomorrow, I'll explain

Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from


Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa


I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from


Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Staring up at heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
Trying to make a living
Oh, where I come from
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
Where I come from

T-T-T-Turn off the radio


There's somethin' missin', there's an anger
Livin' half the world away
I hope you listen for a person
With perspective that isn't always the same
No need to water it down right now
You play the victim, but it's all a charade
Times, they are a-changin'
Get your things in order, or get out the way


And it goes on and on and on...


Turn off the radio
Till they've got something real to say
Turn off the radio
To clear my mind and let me think
I need an answer, I've got the questions
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio
Turn off the radio


There's a division in our culture
That we live with every day
We're just people eating people
Such a sick, sad world we live in today
All I know is I wanna be
Everything expected of me
So everyone, we can agree
Somebody out there understands me


And it goes on and on and on...


Turn off the radio
Till they've got something real to say
Turn off the radio
To clear my mind and let me think
I need an answer, I've got the questions
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio
Turn off the radio


Someone out there, if you're listenin'
We're the victims of our indifference
Tell us more without controlling
What we think with what you're showing


Turn off the radio
Till they've got something real to say
Turn off the radio
To clear my mind and let me think
I need an answer, I've got the questions
Can't anyone out there just relate?

Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

If my nigga cross me, he a dead homie!
Erase him, cremate him, we made him, replace him
Replay it like a murder scene
And I pause it

I bear arms, nigga, long sleeves
Ride rims in the winter, nigga, cold feet
Yeah, no safety on the mothafucka
Run in the bank like Jason in the mothafucka, masked up!

One blunt left, somebody go to the store
Get a two liter, don't forget the cups
Just bought a eighth, 'bout to pour up
Yeah, and that's about to go down
Just rushed the cup and I'm about to slow down

I ain't happy unless I got stacks on the floor
Niggas bet with me, racks on the floor
And since I been winnin' I relax on the floor
Feet up, and my iron cocked

Runnin' shit like a Z28 IROC
From the apartments, dinner I had sack lunch
An AK and a UZI, got tattoos to cover up the bruises

Do you think he's looking down, curled up on his couch right now?
As we fail to figure it out, does he turn down the sound?
Is he proud? Are we proud?
Guess we forgot how to live a life with no filter

Let's pretend they're fascinating
Let's tell little girls that pretty girls are better
Or that pigment or religion really matters

Oh, the land of poor taste

Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days


Does he hang his head at all the greed that we possess?
As the anti-social media perpetuates the mess
Maybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the loose ends
Stressed like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us
God, or is it Mr. G to me?
I hope that through the static, you’ll show us the clarity
'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet
Wonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep
Do you sleep in peace?

Don't touch the remote, we'll be back in a moment
We are not hopeless, we are just coping
The mayhem is rolling, but it ain't showbiz
Reality's potent, chaotic, I know it
But we're growing, have some hope in us
And were we worth all the time you gave up?

Took a dream and a dollar
Went looking for that fortune and fame
Well I found it up in Nashville
With the guitars and the fiddles
Started singing ‘cross the U.S. of A

Way down there in Florida
Once or twice in New Orleans

Didn’t know that I’d be taking

No matter where we strummed it

Had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in the place
While a dead enemy screams in my face
But I better be quiet now, I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on, not over it yet

Wish I knew what you're doing
And why you want to do it this way
So I can't go the distance
I got a long way to go, I'm getting further away
I got a long way to go, I'm getting further away

A smoking-ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his smokin' ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'mma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said ""Freeze!""
I popped him in his knees and shot him—punk, please
’Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin' like a bitch, cause you don't know how to, hush
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me body
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggas


Crooked ass niggas





Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick stepping to the niggas with the props
And any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin' gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin' weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryna play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten kis, I'mma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac got the fuckin' Glock cocked and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
Welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh, this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get a-WAY! Niggas got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch


The crooked ass niggas

Yeah, you don't stop!
Crooked ass niggas




Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggas, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin' piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggas knew, I'm a crooked nigga too



Crooked ass niggas come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbing's what they specialize in
They'll try to get 'cha, they'll sweat 'cha to get in the picture
And then they hit 'cha, son of a bitch! Now he's richer

When did it go wrong? I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down? I go round and around
Thinking about it all the time


I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said


Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?


Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told
Tell me, was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking? I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

Thou shall not kill
I don't wanna hear nothing else
About killin', and that it's God's will


'Cause our children are watching us
They put their trust in us, they're gonna be like us
So let's learn from our history
And do it differently


 For more love, more joy and laughter
 We'll have more than we'll ever need
 We'll have more happy ever afters
 We can all live more fearlessly
And we can lose all the pain and misery



Oh, Rosie, her man he gets too rough
And all she can say
Is he's a good man, he don't mean no harm
He was just brought up that way


But our children are watching us
They put their trust in us, they're gonna be like us
It's okay for us to disagree
We can work it out, lovingly


 For love, for joy and laughter
 You'll have more than you'll ever need
 You have more happy ever afters
 And you can live more fearlessly
And you can lose all your pain and misery



There must be a way to change what's goin' on
No, I don't have all the answers


 For more love, more joy and laughter
 You'll have more than you'll ever need
 You'll have more happy ever afters

When that didn't work we resorted to armed robbery
Yeah, I done it, but I ain't the one they said did it
Before my first verse my Benz had been kitted
I'm so hood, that's what the bitches like about me
She bob and weave, she up and down, she suck the life up out me
I tell you 'bout my regimen, I blow a stack stunting
The coldest shit I'm on it, kid, I'll blow a nigga fronting
I'm dirty, yeah, I do that dirt, I'm down to put that work in
I kick the door to get them bricks, that Eagle get to chirping
You see that beam on ya head, nigga leaking
Yeah, screaming and shit, man, shut the fuck up


I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat

I had a dream niggas got me
Woke up, a nigga shot me
I ain't slept in three days
My eyes red, something wrong with my head
The MAC stashed right under the pillow on my bed
It's not hot, why the fuck am I sweating?
My heart beating, I'm bugging, I wreck it
Bitch, don't move, it's dark, I might panic
Just sit still, I mean it, God damn it
My back against the wall
Fuck the world, I'll kill 'em all
Ain't a nigga too big or too small
Chop 'em down, watch 'em fall
Watch 'em bleed, watch 'em crawl
Watch 'em bleed 'til they gone

Wondering if the same old understanding, stands


I know you got work pretty early, I'll be around 'bout 3:30

Fuck you back to sleep, girl, rock you back


You got my whole mind frame feeling out of focus
And now I'm seeing things I ain't never noticed in you
And if you make me feel like nothing else matters
And your love got caught up in a rapture
And if you still sure in the morning after
I want it in the morning after, you
Baby, I can tell it's real, not surfaced
And we fell in love on purpose
Let me ride, I need your body, yeah
Uh-huh, sweet, come down
Just you, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hold on tight to me
Sweet, rock you back, back, back
And your love got caught up in a rapture

Ain't sorry that I woke ya , I ain't sorry 'bout ya job 
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love 
I know you want me, and you feel me  'cause you never disagree
So when you wake from your sleep, girl

Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh 
Don't say a word, no, no, don't you talk 
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, and rock you back

Gotta ask, ""Why'd she leave her husband?""

Don't be crying on my shoulder every time I'm coming over

I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you

Realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend
I love you to death
But I just can't, I just can't pretend
We weren't lovers first
Confidants but never friends
Were we ever friends?

Lyrics to go 
Lyrics to go 
Lyrics to go 



Goin' on and on to the rhythmic variation
Wakin' in the morning, I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation, please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the drum sensation
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on so of course communication
Bogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation
Decapitatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason 
Makin' all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over 
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor 
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa
Representin' on the mic it seems to be my daily 
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go


It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all 
 It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
 It's like that


I know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin'
Would have tried for singin' but that stuff was not my callin
The mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin'
Walkin' through the door and all them suckers started haulin'
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly 
Today's a hip-hop draft, will I be top-seeded? 
Worked too frickin' hard while all the rest were gettin' weeded
Steady kickin' styles so I can reach that other level 
Don't worry about gettin' gassed, I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this 'cause it surely beats a scramble 
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? 
This I dedicate to all the honeys that be bogle-in
'Cause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go


 I got lyrics to go
Lyrics to go 
Lyrics to go 
Lyrics to go 
Lyrics to go 

I got lyrics to go 
I got lyrics to go 
I got lyrics to go


Please proceed with caution 'cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato 
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh 
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
That are waitin' in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangling my cord with hopes that I’ll stop rockin'
Never will that happen only if it is permitted 
Wait...*sniff sniff* I think somebody shitted 
I guess that will be me 'cause I'm the only one MCin 
I go for what I know doin' a show for human beings
Always try to lead, yo, never will I follow
Blowin' up the spot like Fred did to Rollo
And when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go


Check it out y'all
 It's like that y'all
 Everybody, ah c'mon now

Strange face, with your eyes so pale and sincere
Underneath you know well you have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life where Spring is sprung


Mmm


You would seem so frail in the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion go out to fight
But while the Earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky on the crest of a wave


So forget this cruel world where I belong
I'll just sit and wait and sing my song
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me to your place in the cloud

Of a love that we once shared
In between the lipstick traces
To a time that we once had

An ocean of love in my heart


Bring me the ship of the seasick sailor
Bring me the keys of the sleeping jailor
Bring me the guns of the war torn soldier
Bury the flag slung over his shoulder

Maybe you could love me again
Maybe you could love me again

We fought once to defend
I'd hate to be your enemy

My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well


Amen, Amen, Amen


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean


Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

And pensively stood by his tomb
When in a low whisper I heard something say:
How sweetly I sleep here alone

The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
The tears are all wiped from my eyes

The call of my master compelled me from home
No kindred or relative nigh
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high

Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone

Has kindly assisted me home

"I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And its cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And its cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

Time is like an enemy leaving lovers by the side
The more you cling to love, the more you're gonna lose your mind
All I feel is sadness now
Taking over, taking over, taking over
All I see is black clouds of doubt
Taking over, taking over, taking over

I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And its cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

Time is like an enemy leaving lovers by the side
The more you cling to love, the more you're gonna lose your mind
All I feel is sadness now
Taking over, taking over, taking over

I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And its cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

I wait for you my love
I ache for you my love
Call this a liquid love
Rain down on me

Your love slips through my hands
These streets like sinking sand
Drowning in liquid love
Rain down on me

I call out your name 
Your love is chasing through my veins
Such a foolish game
Your love's no good for me
But it makes me happy

"You can have Charleston
The cobblestone streets
The steeples looking down
On the Battery
The Topsails and the Clydesdales
Pulling people all around
The ocean breeze and the live oak trees
God, I'm gonna miss this town, but

You can have Charleston
I'll pack up and leave
Maybe find a spot on the West Coast
Give you lots of room to breathe
With your new life and your new love
I won't get in your way
I'll just wish you well and try like hell
To smile and walk away, from

My home, my heart
Where I was born, where I was raised
Where one day they're gonna take my body
And lay it in a grave
My soul, don't wanna go
But it's got to be this way
It's gonna break my heart to say, goodbye
But it'll kill me if I stay

You can have Charleston
It's really for the best
Girl, it's your town now
Plus I could never rest
There're too many ghosts on this old coast
Too many memories
It's where we met and we fell in love
It's where you cut me deep and made me bleed

From time to time
I might be passing through
But I promise you
That's all I'll do

You can have Charleston
I'll take these broken dreams
Load 'em in up in a suitcase
And see where it leads
Take 26 until I get
A million miles away
Try and start over
In a brand new place

Motherfuck the police, smoking on some OG
Know I'm riding doly, I ain't fucking playing
Nah, niggas want no beef, pull up with the slow creep
Leave that ass holy, I ain't fucking playing 
Pull up in the coup, shorty grabbing on my root 
Found my inner peace just from smoking all this Buddha 
Know that crime pays, so my nigga I salute ya
Me, I'm getting payed just by using my medulla 


Niggas talk fluent, 'til I put a dart through 'em 
In the dark, chew 'em, make me bring the sharks to 'em 
Shooter splatting paint like a fucking art room 
Leave one 21, now he ain't got no heart to him 
They might run their mouth, but they ain't got the balls to do it
I go hard up in the paint Olajuwon be my influence
Flag be on the left and you know that shit be the bluest
If a hater disrespect I leave that pussy leaking fluids
Focus on the next still got no time to sit reflect 
Always steps ahead, my life is like a game of chess 
Who that, war and test, put him soul straight to rest
Know some Haitians with that voodoo, know Jamaicans with the checks 
Go against the vets like I'm an animal upset
Make 'em vanish out their flesh, put my manners to the test
I'm the illest on the planet, tell the doctor I confess
Rocket launcher through your vest
Fuck the drama, we the best
In designer, I'm enlightened but with commas in my check
Perfect timing, I'm a titan, watch me rule the earth again
I be too determined to be swerving out my lane for trends
I just find a way to cleanse, Sage, that's my lady friend
And she do just what I say as long as i can pay the rent
I been balling so hard lately, feel like i can play Durant
Though I love my mama dearly, sometimes she can save them rants
Put Versace on my frames, I call the shit my hater lense 
Saint Laurent the kicks Amiri Jeans mixed with the Kenzo
On my ownership but got your girlfriend as a rental
She be on my dick, she say I'm fresher than a Mentos
I only get the mental if menstrual 
They know the realest but if not the flow reveal it
Smoking broccoli like my nigga
Free young Kodak, 'bout my skrilla
Got gorillas in my village
Bathing Apes is all i deal with
But somehow a nigga living
Had to sacrifice to get it, HAAN

And gettin' stalked by these crooked cops again
Fuckin' with the young Black male, tryin' to stack bail
And um, stay away from the packed jails

And that's why I had that .45 with one in the chamber

That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin' flex to me, comin' from my enemies
And in their dreams it's hell where they sendin' me
Have I lost control or just another soul?
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin' on yak as I sit back

Never take your eyes off the prize and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try

Weighin' 165 and these tricks should die
For being jealous of a brother when he rise

They hate to see a nigga ballin'
Some of you suckers is rotten, plottin' on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him 
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me

But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped

It is older than Rome and all of this sorrow
See the new Pyramids down in old Manhattan
From the roof of a friend's, I watched an empire ending
Heard it loud and long, the river's song
Time marching on, to a mad man's drum

Don't forget what you've learned
All you give is returned
And if life seems absurd
What you need is some laughter
And a season to sleep
And a place to get clean
Maybe Los Angeles
Somewhere no one's expecting

On a detox walk
Through a Glendale Park
Over sidewalk chalk
Some wrote in red, ""start over""

So I muffle my scream
On an Oxnard beach
Full of fevered dreams that scare you sober
Into saltless dinners

Take the fruit from the tree, break the skin with your teeth
Is it bitter or sweet all depends on your timing
Like a meeting of chance
With a train station glance
Many lifetimes have passed in a instant reminded
Of a millstone house in a seaside town
When your heart gave out in a mission bed

So your wife gave birth to a funeral dirge
As you woke up purged as a wailing infant
In Krung Thep, Thailand

Hear the chimes, did you know that the wind when it blows
It is older than Rome and our joy and our sorrow

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost

At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?


There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes


We all like to put the blame on society these day
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change


I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever


Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line draw between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn


There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes


I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever


The thin line between love and hate

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you

Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you


Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you

Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you


Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated


Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you

Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

I've been trying too hard

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

Don't say goodbye 
Don't turn around

Wish that I could die in my sleep

And just applied Everything that he learned from crack
I'm in now, it's life ain't no turning back, it been foul
So what kinda concerns is that
Peep the signs of the eyes 'cuz it tell it all
One of the few in the Streets that was selling it raw
Made mistakes, but it made me intelligent more
And how I move, you could still look and tell I was poor
How can the hate from another man stop my flow
That's like another pimp thinking he can knock my ho
I'm here now, just trying to copp and blow, couple of cars and lot's of Doe

But I'mma keep on doing me, 'til I die

One by one, seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall, you seen one nigga ball
You done seen 'em all
Even standup niggas seen 'em lean and crawl
What makes a man wanna fiend for more
Life itself is more than a trial or a quest
Intelligent wise, it's like I done ran with the best
And very rarely, you can catch me casually - dressed
I'm more relaxed in a hat and some sweats
Doing me, been amongst some of the street's most strongest men
Around for months then they gone again
Incarcerated, penalized for the love of they acts
Criminals, cold-hearted, now what's fucing wit that?
Where we at? hit inside of a life that's rarely exposed
Spoken in codes for the killers that daily'll dose
Get yours, hit a quota then get indoors, get legit
Then hit them stores

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto

So now it's on y'all, could see, I figured it out
Only a few could say that they been in my house
And caroused at my wall color, blend with my couch
I'm as low as you can go in the south
When it's too deep, it's hard for the mind to relate
Some say I'm too street and way too involved wit the snakes
What make a man bigger that life, I'm twice his age
Understand I'm a sinner but I'm nice some ways
Knee deep in what I speak 'cuz I spit the truth
I become angelic when I sit in the booth
Just a thought of all the ill sh*t that lurk in streets
How can another real nigga wanna work wit police
Bad enough you got thiefs and the beef is rough

Falling for the wrong one
Feeling like the right time
But at least I felt something
Think I’m losing my mind


I’m in need of your love, I just need you right here
Sharing all of those things, whispering in my ear
Tell me what they can’t know, show me what they can’t see
Tell me all the ideas, they would never believe
You see I remember my home
I remember those trees, I remember those pasts
I remember the breeze, I remember the reason why all of those people that passed
Remember you opened your heart for a second
Gave me your time for a minute
Remember the tone in your voice when I told you that I might be coming to visit
But maybe I’m tripping
You catching me slipping
Down this road again
But this time I ain't falling
First day back 'cause the demons keep calling
Look at this world and I start withdrawing
And its so hard not to fade, see its so hard not to fall
But I gotta find peace
And I gotta find sleep 'cause I don’t see it at all
So I’m going, going, going, deeper and deeper
You see I’m finding it out before my spirit gets weaker
I got a fever, fever
Been feeling sick in the head
I need a doctor, doctor
Or just one more cigarette

"Later that day we made our way to the old cathedral door
A flame, a figure, a shadow
Walked away towards the tower alone
We must be close nearby
Hope cannot her own way through dark
It's cold, I'm torn, it's gray
There's a light that never grows dim

But if all can be made right there's still a chance on New Year's Day
And if grace were here I would love to see her face somehow, someway
And if all is well then it means there's still a chance in hell

You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine
There is shelter, shelter from the mire of life
Claiming sanctuary from the fire that drove you in
You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine

Climbing the stairs towards heaven
Making our own way into the room
Empty, barren
Not another soul in sight
Then when the moon came crawling
There in the night a great divide
A whisper, a motion, a calling
Were the 99 all right?

But if all can be made right there's still a chance on New Year's Day
And if all is well then it means there's still a chance in hell

You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine
There is shelter, shelter from the mire of life
Claiming sanctuary from the fire that drove you in
You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine

Now a tradition's said buying penance did
A wrong a right, a great collapse
Great collapse

You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine
There is shelter, shelter from the mire of life
Claiming sanctuary from the fire that drove you in
You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine

It is the night of your dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the Soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees; O hear the angel voices!
O night divine! O night that leads to morn

Fall on your knees; O hear the angel voices!
O night divine! O night when Christ was born
O night! O holy night!
O night divine!


Hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands
All that remains

Oh oh I love those city lights
But when the sun comes up
And the party's over

Home from work got your money in your pocket
Pull on your boots brand new suit
If you had the chance you'd hock it
For a night on the tiles

With the old familiar faces
Buy 'em a drink kick up a stink

Sabes bien que fue un engaño
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Así mismo me engañaste
Y lloras hoy porque fallaste
Cómo tratas de buscarme
Después que tú me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme
Busqué la forma de olvidarte

Ooh

Sabes bien que fue un engaño

Why, oh why? You stay, you stay
And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay


Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder


Why, oh why? 
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you


I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga 
With your mind and your heart and your soul 
For your goals, in control, you let it go 
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby


Why, oh why? 
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal


You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slipping at all, you gon' be mine 


Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillan en la luz son los que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh, you stay
Tell me why you 
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillian me dan luz solo que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh
Think you're too loyal

Of course it's me, AZ
The most hated, most underrated
But it is, what it is


Cartier's studded frames on my facial
By this tint, you can sense I'm bi-racial
Benevolence of a pimp and I'm grateful
Heaven sent, I was meant for a late view
Lived the life, unknown the most
Never boast, got that grown approach
I get it in, professor with the dividends
Doe or Die, succesor of my sibblings
You know it
From petty crimes to a street poet
It's all the grind, steady mind, taught to keep forward
The game's crucial, no gangs I remain neutral
It's more fruitful, trueful I'm living beauful 
What the loot do, love it or leave it
Minor beef to above it to breathe it
Reclining seats, fuck how others perceive it
I'm doing me, hip-hop since Spoonie Gee in ziplocks
So I ask why y'all fooling with me


I work hard 
To get the things I have
I work hard
To get the things I have
And I wanna know why you wanna play on me
Why you wanna, playa hate on me 
Why you wanna, playa hate on me 
Why you wanna, playa hate on me 
Why you wanna, playa hate on me


Imagine this: no money, just arrogance and hungry
Can see a sex freak, fly mystique and spunky
Comfy amongst the streets why y'all creeps is lunchmeat
Frauds, like emotional broadsthat's on their monthly
Grungy, violence is the only respect
The stress numb me
Death is the last thing left
So get from me if your math ain't matching your words
I know the half so when I laugh I'm just relaxing my nerves
Love furs, diamonds is a mans best friends
His and hers is all captured on the camera lens
I'm what it was, for the buzz and the torch was lit
Never a dud, you all bug, get off my dick
Y'all need hugs, I'm just trying to mind my own
Little patron, few shines, all kind of colognes
Monotone, it's assertiveness that come when you grown
I sense nervouseness, y'all know I'm in that murderous zone
But still courties, shake hands and kiss the kids
Make plans with the Ms. take trips to live
Why bid when the smart got a lot of advantage
It's a art, so know that y'all involved with a mammoth
Single handed, never taken nothing for granted
Never fronting, my face ain't never touching the canvas
Understand this


I work hard 
To get the things I have
I work hard
To get the things I have
And I wanna know why you wanna play on me
Why you wanna, playa hate on me 
Why you wanna, playa hate on me

But they can't fill their places or ever be

And if you ever think of me
It would make my weary heart so light, sweetheart
Your face again to see

Believe it or not, that is the sound of an invasion. Yes, that is the sound created by the musical invasion of America by the world's hottest recording group: A Tribe Called Quest

They are non-conformists to such a great degree that no two members ever dress alike. And many educators consider their popularity resulted from their becoming symbols of teenage rebellion

They certainly are raking in a lot of good green American money and gathering hundreds of thousands of teenage fans in the process

Comprehend to the track for it's wide 'cause
Gettin' mentions on the tip of the vibe buzz
Rock 'n' roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afro-centric living is a big shrug
A life filled with *horn* that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above

I get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really, they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
I thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winters spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door-knocker, down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father, you just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa
I really need a break, could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label
I go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal


First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up


The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes, yeah
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes


Alright
Spirit's working now


I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime
In high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass
Send my Tweet, fold my arms, twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know


First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up


The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes


Three verses, hell yes
I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the seams snappin', and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin'
'Til the dream happens, I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin' like
Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters
And black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin', knees bowed, tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings


Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream, may you never wake up


The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes,  ready or not, ready or not
Ready or not,  ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it will not wait another day
No more, no more 
The day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay
No more, no more 
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it is

Poured you down the drain with no regrets
Went through 11 of those 12 steps

Now there's ashes in the ashtray

I fell asleep on a dark and starlit sea
With nothing but the cloak of God's mercy over me
I come upon strange earth and a great black cave
I dreamt I awoke as if buried in my grave


We've been swallowed up
We've been swallowed up
Disappeared from this world
We've been swallowed up


The bones of sailors from the north and sailors from the east
Lay high in a pyre in the belly of a beast
A beast should you wander in its path upon your ship and your flesh he'll sup
You'll disappear from this world until you've been swallowed up


We've been swallowed up
We've been swallowed up
Disappeared from this world
We've been swallowed up


We trusted our skills and our good sails
Our faith that with God the righteous in this world prevail

Got me thinking about better days...



Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smoking weed like it ain't no thang
So even kids wanna try now
They lie down and get ran through
Nobody watched 'em clockin the evil man do
Faced with the demons
Addicted to hearin victims screaming
Guess we was evil since birth
Product of cursed semens
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops
The only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets
It ain't the same
Too many murders
Too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried
Plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith




Who would've guessed that in my future years
I'd be stressing, some say the ghetto's a sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Try to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Saving up for some Jordan's cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too
And so am I. I can't take her to places she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin
But what can I say, keep yo' head up and
Try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith




Square fools, since back in high school
We was true, me and you hardly parted or separeted
We stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbanger and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressing like grown men when rolling
I went to dark, smoking Newports, gaming marks
Got a place in my heart, homie stay smart
Locked you up in the penn'
And gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hoping you well, I know it's hell doing time in the cells
You need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doing cool
I settled down, had a family
Working in night school
Every once in a while
I reminisce and wonder how we ever came to this

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder and the wind shouts back


Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat


Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene that's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere

Looking for meat

Wants you to eat


I've held my licence
It came with birth
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game

Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill, I take my leave

Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And driveby's robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know

And facing me now, what do I do?

And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong

Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin' getting high with them armies

I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother

Things always get better God don't like ugly
And God don't like no quitters

God bless the child that can hold his own
Y'know? You got to stand strong
And when these busters try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face tell em hold on, and be strong

That you was dissing her to talk to me


Why you wanna play me, don't play me
You can't fade me, don't fade me
Trying to persuade me, persuade me to get wit' you
Why you wanna play me, don't play me
You can't fade me, don't fade me
Trying to persuade me, and if she only knew


If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you
And if your girl could only see
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me




If you a chicken head, ba-ba-ba-baw
All up in my grill like ill
'Cause I wear Nikes and do not wear Brigettes
I  over in my Lex and see you drive by in your Chevette
I burn baby, burn, burn, every time I twist my hips
I see your boyfriend turn, turn
Is it your concern, to see to not to look boo?
What would she do if she knew?

Fool, a high sigh, wave byes-byes to ya peoples now
Hit you wit this track from the leaders now

King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know


I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
There in my truck the dog and I
Then one day the King up and died
Then I thought about the times we had
Once when I kicked him when he was bad
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history


King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog

That old King was a friend of mine
Never knew a dog that was half as fine
I may find one, you never do know
Because I still got a long way to go
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history

They told me I was lucky
To have my chance with you
Now last year's summer romance
Is this year's winter blues
I treated you so nicely
To jewelry and champagne
But you left me empty handed
Yeah, you left me feeling played


Now I hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of crappy
What you did this holiday?
When I gave you my heart, you ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So I wrote you a song, hope that you sing along
And it goes, ""Merry Christmas, kiss my ass!""


They say I'm losing my mind
I thought that for a while
I tear down decorations
They remind me of your smile
I hate that mistletoe
It makes me think of our first kiss
You bit my lip, you pulled me close
And then you taught me how to quit


Now I hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of crappy
What you did this holiday?
When I gave you my heart, you ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So I wrote you a song, hope that you sing along
And it goes, ""Merry Christmas, kiss my ass!""


So sick of calling
You won't telephone me
No, fuck you, girl, I'm going out
I gave you my all
But our love hit a wall, now
I'm jingle belling
And everyone's yelling
We'll drink 'til the bars shut us down
Ain't that just what Christmas is all about?


And I hope, hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I'm not laughing, 
Don't you think it's so damn trashy
What you did this holiday? 
I gave you my heart, 
You ripped it apart
Like the wrapping paper trash 
So I wrote you a song
Hope that you sing along
Here it goes
""Merry Christmas, , kiss my ass.""

Not one of wood or stone
Walk through my door of desire, baby
Come on in and make it your home
Don't need a window to watch you, baby

Don't need no key to unlock ya, baby

When you want it give me a shout

Take me higher
Building a house of fire, baby
Buildin' it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch

We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire

Brick by brick the flames get higher
Build it strong with our desire

And cheaper jokes at our expense

For half a crown for half a kingdom

For half a town

Build a fortune up in black and white

But I'll need a master copy

Shake an apple off the apple tree

Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out


Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged


Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged


Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Tears mingling with the rain
I'm so lonesome I could cry just like old Hank
Staring down on the city street
Feeling empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be to fill my tank

A place I can go where I can be free
Where I can be happy and just be me
Home, where the warm winds blowing
And the rivers flowing along
Like a lazy bum in the mid-day sun
And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome

I left home, I was 17
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true
I've had good luck
I'm not complaining that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful for
One of those things is the magic door that opens up
Back to the time when I was a kid
To the sound of the crickets and the katydids
It's called

Home
On the front porch swinging and fern pots hanging
Home
With the church bells ringing and voices singing
Old songs that's in my mind like a stitch in time
Where the tea is sweet and the love's complete
For me, I wanna go
Home

I often think about where I have been
Where I am going and lots about when I think about
Home

Where the soul find comfort
And the heart find pleasure
Home

Where the depths of love is hard to measure it's
Home

I hear you callin'
I hear you callin'

I'll never be lost
As long as I know there's a place like that
Where I can go
Where I can restore my weary soul
On the mountain slopes of the south ""Blue Smoke""
Of home home sweet home

Home, back to the hills of the Whip-poor-wills
Home, with the fireflies blinking
And the night stars twinklin'
Home, honeysuckle vine and muscadine wine at
Home, where the ginsing glows and the chevy goes-a
Home, with family and friends and joy that never ends
Home
There's no place like it, no place like it

Wide on my plastic toys

Stole me a dog-eared map

Have I found you? Flightless bird
Jealous, weeping
Or lost you? American mouth

Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos

Thrown in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream

Cause all you was the fire for my soul
And now I'm up here running the show

I'm looking forward to another day without you
The way I see it you could never do what I do
I welcomed you with open arms
You drove the knife right through my heart
So now I'm crossing out the pain that's been tearing us apart


You were out of sight, now you're out of line
Went to your head, now you're left behind


Let me go, can't you see?
You're just the next best thing to me
Here I go, honestly
You're just the next best thing to me


I'm packing up my things and moving on without you
As far as I can see you'll never do what I do

Choking as the water fills your lungs
Can't you see, to me you're dead

Are destined to stay alive?
And some of us are here just
So that we'll die?

That's what it is, ""The Sound of Revenge""
Summer 2005 nigga, whoooooo


Gimmick rappers, can't lie forever
But as long as I'm here, gimmick rappers gon die together
Told lil' mama I love drama, no one tried to tell her
She shoulda left the club, instead of trying to find a fella
The villain's born, dark storms that's my kind of weather
Sending gimmick niggas to the mall, to go buy umbrellas
Like Eminem was telling them, that they should die it yella
Some of my fans they look like Cham, but say I am better
Picture the though of that, since no one spit a harder rap
I told 'em that I'm Jehova's lil' brother, the God of rap
Don't play me like you a atheist, face it it's more fact
Gimmick rappers have heart attacks, when you tell 'em that God is back
The problem is more than that, like Iraq when the gats in em
You diss me you gon be done, like a snack when the rats get em
After the baptism, the black in the black hit em
No need for that gat, cause fact is the raps kill em
Live your life like a mockery, niggas will see the prophecy
Stare at a flight of stairs, 'fore you ever think you on top of me
Nigga how could you possibly, think that you could be stopping me
Destiny couldn't stop me, I move and that hoe be watching me
Fans are no longer crying to see, Jay-Z throw up the dynasty
Not big as that nigga Jigga, but nigga tell 'em it's time for me
Rap game is dying to me, I'm the rapper they trying to see
I could bring it back, not only force-ably but violently
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing from Houston
The truth and I'm in the booth, and your truth is a big illusion
What you choosing if you're choosing, to jump into the confusion
You losing and end up choosing, and cruise it into a bruising nigga


I'm peeping out here in these streets, and I see these old
Record labels trying to advance, trying to drop old material
On a nigga, so instead of Controversy Sells we gon switch it up
Summer 2005, ""The Sound of Revenge""


Then they said on the radio, I ain't beefing with rappers no mo'
But tell 'em to go correct it, cause rappers be acting homo
Came in and screaming duo, I'm leaving and screaming solo
Disrespecting the logo's a no-no, I'll leave you rojo
Hey that's red in Spanish, real niggas'll never vanish
We rise up and then we ride up on haters, prepare to panic
Put ya teflon on, you better go get it plant it
Rip off your chest piece, to make niggas remember Janet
Ay log on the net, type in ""the villain"" and search
And realize why gimmick rappers is hurt, cause the truth hurts
And you jerks , is a package of skirts
Put your little advance, back in your purse ha-ha
That nigga say he don't like me, he acting like he a wifey
Ain't held a pistol, acting like he the type that'll snipe me
You don't like me invite me, you don't like me come fight me
And if you can't afford the flight, and you don't like me then write me
I ain't concerned, with any of your concerns
I'm trying to stack, plack on top of plack like gum germs
I got enough tongue twisters, to make the tongue turn
Make the sun burn, I'm so hot I could give it sun burn
So call up, Kay Slay and ask him who is
The trillest to spit it, then call up DJ Whoo-Kid
DJ Drama, Vlad Green, Lantern and Kool-Kid
Tell 'em it's time to switch they playlist up, with the new kid
What's his name, Chamillitary mayn


Yeah, the hardest rap nigga and if you beg to differ
Step to the mic, and spit some'ing sicker nigga
Ha-ha, Chamillitary mayn

If you don't seek justice, you probably don't know peace
At least the kind of peace that Jesus brings us on account of belief
I don't know if you've noticed but there's a direct corellation
Between your profession of faith and your expressions of grace to the hopeless
Yeah, it's true that all men are broken, but to only help the healthy
Would make us miss the open wounds that matter the most in those moments
The deconstruction of dignity buried deep in the heart of assumptions
Where selective justice is just another name for social corruption
A system is flawed when just cause is ""just because""
But even a man at odds with the law is made in the image of God
It's admitted that none of us are innocent all of us complicit
But to solicit the silence of injustice doesn't just dismiss it
And just in case you forgot, Christ will come at just the right time
A divine King bringing perfect justice to judge all of mankind
The only difference between us I'll stay seated at Jesus' feet
And rest between the span of His hands where justice and mercy meet


There's a virus in my iris
I was blinded, close my eyelids
See my Savior laying down his righteous life
And saying ""I forgive"" 
Virus in my iris 
Deep down I know my eyes are sick


The wrath of God is coming, can you hear the warning?
Joy comes in the morning, but now is a time of mourning
When all I'm seeing lately is a nation going crazy
Looking bad, needs some hope like the words maybe
If or probably, but if I'm honest in light of all these problems
If my hope is only probable, how long 'til it dissolves?
I don't have the capacity to see these problems solved
I take comfort knowing that my God is still involved
That's my certainty when the road I'm on is serpentine
And I'm threatened by the serpent's sting, the evil one is prowling
Looking to devour, but no one can usurp the King
Lord, have mercy while we're waiting for the final hour
This is my Father's world, it's also a fallen one
The domino effect has infected the whole set-up
I'm not afraid to talk about social injustices
Let's also talk about the throne where perfect justice is
It sounds insensitive and some will hate the stench of it
But the church is not faithful if we fail to mention it
We worship a God who can speak to the world's pain
Because salvation for us came through the Lamb who was slain

No, no, babe
Yeah, oh
Baby, you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
*Women moaning*
Na-na-na-na-na-na

*Women moaning*


If you leave this time I fear that you'll be gone for good
So I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with


It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
It seems that you're the only reason for it


I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh


It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do


So the iceberg never broke and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poke 
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more and in my notepad, man I wrote 
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it, if it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last I'ma hope, so iceberg don't float 
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit, it'll be grand as, ten Grammies or my granny still standing with a note that read ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most , one day it'll make you grow 
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult 
When the bright cameras are still cramming in your face and it provoke 
You to act mannish, just stay planted cause you reaping what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and keep a noose from 'round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it, when you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck you would do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em lord? Do you hear 'em lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when remorse that I give, when they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive""
When they never see good in me, even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord


It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do

Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?


Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh


Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?


You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking


Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh


Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

America, the bondage is off, knowledge is freedom
We all niggas never ignorant getting goals accomplished
Let's have a drink, it's on me


Yes, I'm doin' it a few soo-wooing it
My man Lou crew bandanna blue-ing it
They buck at cars won't give a fuck who in it
Bust at broads the gods say they ruin shit
20 to a clip hollow heads loaded them legislators ain't doing shit college heads know it
Raps and its influences turning kids out
Was trapped but still intuitive learn to switch routes in drought
My reality's placed on principalities so
Any casualties gracefully done carefully
The real attracted me re-exchange and bill
Mathematically calculating maintain and chill but still
Mind of Muhammad signs of the Masonic both combine I'm a verbal rhyme Galenic
Promise, pay homage only here for a spell and like that
I'm back where the highest form dwell its right back
Just like them 9 milli shells that systematically let off and murdered Sean Bell in hell
Smell the corpse of the homies we lost from a era so pure you could never be sure
The game's so sick I'm just looking for the cure
Like that Dead Prez flick when they was lookin' for the score
This whole shit here is forceman's sure ya'll talk about war well a nigga from the core
Sci-fi tricks I'm the spook by the door
Men in all black took the coupe out on tour
Hi-top kicks, kept the sweatsuits velour
Fitted all colors we considered all brothers
First we all chilling now we killing one another
See these hustlers on the covers of these FEDS and DIVAS
The game's dead trying to make these young heads believe us either
Understand or be under the land..my man


Peace to the world, peace to the world, Papoose Pa-poose
Knowledge is freedom hop in the BM and drive to New Zealand
Rhymin' with reason I could defeat him, I could delete him
I could just eat him, not to deceive him, not to mislead him
Drop it to feed him lock in and teach him proper believin'
Cockin' and squeeze him pop him and leave him
His pockets is bleedin'
So know I got your per diem, I hug the block 'till the P.M
I was wise and strategic on the rise with the thesis since I was rockin the leases
Since I was coppin' Adidas
Since small sizes of sneakers like Barack with the speeches
You bloodclots is anemic
My mugshot in the precinct, your gunshot is the weakest
My young mind is the deepest
You cockblockers and leeches, I'll blow your Pradas to pieces
Hold a thousand my queen and fill her vagina with semen
It's so exotic and pleasing I gotta stop when I'm skeetin'
When I was my momma fetus, her stomach sat by the speakers
The music got in my features, that's just why I'm prestigious
Hold my bottle and drink it ain't suck it out of her cleavage
Cause I was ingenious since doc was circumcising my penis
I'm a scholar succeedin' and all of my dollars increasin'
Got a lot of achievements cause I divide with the weak ones
Sick and tired of these heathens
I see a lot of 'em schemin' they hearts throbbin' and tweakin'
But I could stop 'em from beatin'
Drop the hottest releases I don't bother with demons
I leave 'em whinin' and screamin' just like a toddler who teethin'
I pledge-alizes allegiance from the bottom I'm creepin'
All ya'll could line up and meet him, the God inside of his Kingdom
You claimin' you done bidded what that did prove
When you couldn't walk one visit in that man's shoes

How loneliness can feel
She has her own small world
And nothing in it's real
Just spread joy all around
And watch the sun coming down

When I was young the world was rich
With spices and par fays
My heart was filled with pride
My head was filled with praise
I wore my youth like a crown
And watch the sun coming down

Love only lasts for a moment
Life holds a brief smile for all
The sunshine can't last forever
And soon the night must fall

Memories can fade
In dreams that you can find
You'll finally reach the end
And never look behind
No use in turning around
It's just the sun coming down

No use in turning around

He gonna give you all his love

Yeah, I got all kind of bitches, a vet bitch, a beginner bitch
My phone ringing and I ain't answering cause I'm in a bitch

If we going out we going Dutch pay for your dinner bitch
Look bitch, this is my life I'm on some different shit
Every different day I wake up to play with a different bitch
Bitches love me, just like I love me
Fat bitch, skinny bitch, short bitch, tall bitch

In the strip club, let her lick your ass bitch
Get the cash bitch and then go back to your man bitch

Nah-ah ,nah-ah
Now
I can feel the animal inside
My resolve is weakening
Pounding at the doors of my mind
It's nearly overpowering
I cannot begin to describe
The hunger that I feel again
Run if you intend to survive


For the beast is coming to life
Taking form in the glimmer in this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night


For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight


I can hear it calling again
The primal need is filling me
Changes are about to begin
And now my blood is boiling
I can see the fear in your eyes
But you can't bring yourself to scream
Time to shed the mortal disguise


For the beast is coming to life
Taking form in the glimmer in this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night


For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight


We begin the hunt and I
Feel the power course, as the creatures take flight
For the kill is close and I will be satisfied
For the smell of fear tonight
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied
You're mine


For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight


For the animal's soul is mine
And the world around will never hear your cries
An unholy crime
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

In my imagination I feel my expectations rise
A passion that redefines life
I surrender to the light, here's a feeling undefined
What I've waited for finally arrived


And I know that this is why we can reach the sky
There's no limits in my mind


Now, this is my time
It is the breaking point, the end of the line
This is the reason for my strife 
You keep me alive
This is my breaking point, so show me the sign
Burns like a fire in my eyes 



With no hesitation, I stare right through the devil's eyes
Today is the day I can die
Feels like growing hunger, but this is why I'm still alive
Now's the time, put your weakness aside


My adrenaline, your lust
Ash to ash and dust to dust
Raise it to eleven and show the sign


Now, this is my time
It is the breaking point, the end of the line
This is the reason for my strife 
You keep me alive
This is my breaking point, so show me the sign
Burns like a fire in my eyes 


Remember, all exceptional, sense of fear
Never seemed to find the secret path, I'm so sincere
What ever happened to the fallen ones? 
To the fragile ones?


And I feel that you and I, we can reach the sky
There's no limits in my mind


Now, this is my time
It is the breaking point, the end of the line
This is the reason for my strife 
You keep me alive
This is my breaking point, so show me the sign
Burns like a fire in my eyes 
By my side

"I have made you in my likeness
And I will make you the keeper of my garden world
If you honor me in kind, I'll be grateful, but be warned
I'm a jealous God
Who placed the demons in hell
And the angels in heaven
At my side
So set me free, I'll grant your hearts desire
And I will share the secrets of the grand design
Give me daughters, send me sons and I'll make them all chosen ones
I will send them out to die
To meet the angels of death
With no tears, no regrets
I was cast down from the heights
My blood must pay for the debt
That was made when they left
Because of me
And if they taste the blood we'll let them drink
And if they taste the flesh we'll let them eat
And if one has to be forgiven then we'll pardon all of them
And if they raze our walls we'll let them in
And if they raise their swords we'll let them hit
And if one has to be forgiven then
We'll love them
Let me lead you to the garden world
I will place you at the right of my father's hand
I was tempted in the wild I crossed from start till end of time
I emerged the sacred lamb
Whose blood must pay for the debt
That was made when they left
As I ascend into the sky I'll free the angels from hell
And place them in heaven
At my side

Well hop in the hack
Turn on the key
Pop in the clutch
Let the wheels roll free


Come on honey, let me sing them away
Come on honey, let me sing them away
Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away


Give me a little of that old time love
Cause i ain't never had near enough
Honey, walk that walk with style and grace
This ain't no knock-down drag-out race
It don't matter much, pick any gear
Brind you a pound and drop the rear
Baby, baby what can i say
I'm here to drive those blues away
I sent a letter to a man i know
Said, ""one for the money and two for the show.""
I wait all summer for his reply
Said, ""three to get ready and four to fly.""
Only two things in the world i love
That's rock 'n' roll and my turtle dove
When i was a young man i needed good luck
But i'm a little bit older now and i know my stuff

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love


When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love


I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong


I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I’d go crawling down the avenue
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love


The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet


I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

"I touched you once too often
Now I don't know who I am
My fingerprints were missing
When I wiped away the jam
Yes I called my fingerprints all night
But they don't seem to care
The last time that I saw them
They were leafing through your hair

Fingerprints, fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?

Yeah I thought I'd leave this morning
So I emptied out your drawer
A hundred thousand fingerprints
They floated to the floor
You know you hardly stopped to pick them up
No you don't care what you lose
Ah you don't even seem to know
Whose fingerprints are whose

Fingerprints, fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?

And now you wanna marry me
You wanna take me down the aisle
You wanna throw confetti fingerprints
Ha you know that's not my style
For sure I'd like to marry you
But I can't face the dawn
With any girl who knew me
When my fingerprints were on

Fingerprints, fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?

Fingerprints, oh fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?

Have you ever seen a one trick pony in the field, so happy and free?
If you've ever seen a one trick pony then you've seen me
Have you ever seen a one-legged dog making its way down the street?
If you've ever seen a one-legged dog then you've seen me


Then you've seen me
I come and stand at every door
Then you've seen me
I always leave with less than I had before
Then you've seen me
Bet I can make you smile when the blood, it hits the floor
Tell me, friend, can you ask for anything more?
Tell me can you ask for anything more?


Have you ever seen a scarecrow filled with nothing but dust and weeds?
If you've ever seen that scarecrow then you've seen me
Have you ever seen a one-armed man punching at nothing but the breeze?

Tell me can you ask for anything more?


These things that have comforted me, I drive away
This place that is my home, I cannot stay
My only faith's in the broken bones and bruises I display


Have you ever seen a one-legged man trying to dance his way free?

Uh, soli Deo gloria, uh. Once again. Thirteen letters! Yeah. It's the book of Romans right hear y'all! Here we go!


I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will


Awake from your slumber, rise, a letter from the wise
The book of Romans, the Christian faith summarized
By Paul, a bondservant of Christ Jesus
Called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel
Chapter one, sixteen and seventeen is the thesis
'Cause our sins are colossal, hearts are harder than fossils
That's everybody's plight, can't' solve it, goodnight
How do sinners get right in a Holy God's sight?
Amazing is the answer, see: Romans states it candidly
The first three chapters: God's case against humanity
Whether it's idolatry or religious hypocrisy
No one can possibly see the charges and say, ""It's not for me""
Everybody's guilty, everybody's filthy
Before God on judgment day is where everybody will be
For those who believe in Jesus who suffered and died, yo



I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will


Yo, at the cross the wrath of God was spent on Jesus
On behalf of all who repent and believe this
We receive His perfect righteousness
In exchange, believers cursed lives are His
Behold the blessedness for Earth's cold residents
Chapter four, Paul defends it from the Old Testament
Up to this point, we saw the need for justification
In chapter five and following, we see it's implications
In service and purity, we yearn for maturity
Empowered by Christ, who gives eternal security
Slowly but surely, He removes every vice
Raised to newness of life through our union with Christ
But chapter seven finds us strugglin' with sin
It's buggin' us within but He loves us to the end
Even with complications through sin's occupation
For God's consecrated there's no condemnation
The Holy Spirit inside, He comforts like no other
He convinces us we're God's children even when we suffer
Nothing in creation could ever separate us
From the love of God in Christ Jesus who saved us
In chapter nine we see God is sovereign in His mercy
His dealings with Israel shows He's working out His purposes
By the end of eleven it's Jew and Gentile together
United in Christ to His glory forever 


I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will


Yo, so in view of God's mercies
We remove our worldly uniforms and throw on crucified jerseys
Holy and acceptable, ruled by the Divine 
Being transformed by renewal of the mind
Yeshua's design, obedience to the Scriptures
With love as the key ingredient in the mixture
The godly man's picture under the new covenant
Mindful of God, we submit to the goverment
Not passing judgment on weaker brothers
Instead, we spread love to them to keep them from stumbling
When we do this, God will truly then smile
As Christ is glorified through Jew and Gentile
And the God of peace at His judgment seat
Will soon crush Satan under our feet 
Now this is just an overview, go and read Romans through
And I pray the God of Romans will grab a hold of you


I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

 
So that's it man. The book of Romans. But yo, don't just take my word for it. Yo, when this is over, grab the Word and read it for yourself. You gotta get into God's Word, and get God's Word into you. There's a lot of good commentaries out there, grab one. My man John MacArthur, uh, Leon Morris, James Boyce, R. C. Sproul. Gotta get into God's Word, y'all. Grace and peace to the 1-1-6. Yeah, we out. Uh

Hey, j-j-jaded, you got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be
You're getting it all over me, ex-rated


My, my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you


Hey j-j-jaded, in all it's misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side

We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded

Wouldn't trade it

When everything you see is a blur

They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star


They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug


I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone


I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends, but I’m the one that they want
Miss America, with the blue mascara on


I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know


Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pickup truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land


I wear my red lipstick, got my coat and gun
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone


I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in, but I just have to go on
Miss America, now I’m gone, baby, gone


I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know


I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun


I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go


I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go

There's a pale horse comin'
I'm gonna ride it
I'll rise in the morning
My fate decided
I'm a dead man walkin'
I'm a dead man walkin'


In St. James Parish
I was born and christened
Now I've got my story
Mister no need for you to listen
It's just a dead man talkin'


Once, I had a job, I had a girl
But between our dreams and actions
Lies this world


In the deep forest
Their blood and tears rushed over me
All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun
And my fear up inside of me
Like a dead man talkin'


'Neath a summer sky my eyes went black
Sister, I won't ask for forgiveness
My sins are all I have


Now the clouds above my prison
Move slowly across the sky
There's a new day dawnin'
And my dreams are full tonight...

He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross
Of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer
Of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger
The keeper of
The key to the locks


Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner


If you see him in the subway
He'll be down
At the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows
He knows who you are
When you get off
At your station alone
He'll know that you are




There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something
That he needed
And he pleaded
With her not to go
On the day that she left
He died
But it did not show
