"Olvidar
yo s bien que no podes
como la sociedad olvida
que fuiste obligado a marchar,
en su defensa.
Recordando el mal momento
atrincherado en tu habitacin;
soledad, humo y penumbras
despertares de ultratumba.
Apocalipsis del sustento interior
andar sin encontrarle alivio al tormento
desesperante, mrbida afliccin
del visitante
y su castigo.
Fui elegido
para cantarte
por quienes quieren olvido restarte
grave pesado
mas no inconsciente
yo te lo mando ex combatiente.
Grave pesado
mas no inconsciente
yo te lo mando ex combatiente.
Para vos.
Apocalipsis del sustento interior

"Saat ku ber cermin pada air yang tenang
tampak ku lihat diri mu dengan pesona
mu dan ter senyum manis untuk ku andai kan dapat ku
putar waktu kan ku per sembah kan
seribu bintang untuk mu, andai kan dapat ter cipta lagi
kan ku ajak diri mu terbang ke nirwana,
sebagai tanda janjiku padamu semua hanya lah
fatamorgana dan yang ter sisa kini
tinggal pusara mu kenangan mu tlah sirna..",Rock
"She leads me to the bathroom stall
Friends are waiting down the hall
She takes my hand she won't let go
feels so lonely and so cold
so cold, so lonely, and so cold
Got so many things to try
By the birrors getting by
Some will say that it kills
Pain or pleasure pop the pills
So cold, so lonely and so cold
Take cover, Take cover, Torture Chamber, Lover
Take cover, Take cover, Torture Chamber, it's cold
Got so many bills to pay
Baby still wants to play
Friends are waiting in the car
I don't think we're gonna get that far
So Cold, so lonely and so cold
Feel so lonely i could fly, Write a new sky
But she don't want to try
I feel so empty, we should land
I'm just another man, she leans on to stand
Sitting in the bathroom stall
she's got eyes like a doll
she was raised in the malls
downtown she'll learn to fall
so cold, so lonely and so cold",Pop
"A dirty grey skyscraper -
One of thousands in this area
No one knows each other
No one knows
About the bestial rituals of Sendi
KANNIBAL RITUAL
KANNIBAL RITUAL
He called a taxi and told the driver
To carry his bags downstairs
Then he hits the driver to be stunned
Sendi took him inside his apartment
KANNIBAL RITUAL
KANNIBAL RITUAL
Cut him into pieces, ripped him up
And devoured hid warm, vibrating heart
Blood runs to the ground
He also took the othe offals

"She likes to call him
Wake him at night when he's in bed
She's, oh, so quiet
Hangs up when he says his name
Maybe it's by habit
They were lovers, they could talk all night
She gets excited by the thought that
He's afraid she might come back
Who could possibly save
Save them from madness?
Love is the common name
Again they depend on the one to blame
What can he say?
He's got that creepy feeling
Everyone they know says
She's over him, she's moving on
How come she knows
Everything he does
And every place he goes?
Who could possibly save
Save them from madness?
Love is the common name
Again they depend on the one to blame",Indie

One fell off and bumped his head
Mama called the doctor,

No more monkeys jumping on the bed
Four little monkeys jumping on the bed

"Green bed of bottles, open to the sky
Bare head of drunk man, the beads of sweat go dry
He says he's sorry, tender as a lamb
she says, ""go"", meaning, ""stay"", meaning, ""You have to pay""
Behind the moon / In the dead zone
In the darkness where lovers all are blind
Sources of light in this land of the dead
are electric shocks and blows to the head
The silence broken by his voice alone
saying, ""yes"", meaning, ""no"", as he tears down their home
Behind the moon / In the dead zone
I'll still be calling, calling out for you
Behind the moon, when all hope has gone
Well, what else would you have me do?
Green bed of bottles
Green bed of bottles and bottles and...

"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness
Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting
Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

Love is their whole happiness

But its all so easy

"I can't believe I'm stuck here in the room
When I look out my window at night I don't see the moon
But I'm happy to be happy again
I've been pitching the idea ever since I was 22
And the calendar says I'm almost 26
Well that just can't be true
But I'm happy to be happy again
And this trickles up and down my spine
Like grains from an hour glass
I know it will pass
I tried to leave the house but there was no use
I declined to stay in bed cos it seemed like something I could do
Still I'm happy to be happy again",Rock
"Spend a lifetime working for these people
To make what they earn in one day
There are options to choose, I call it social progress
Progress to not be abused
They were arrested for their views
It was the protesters they screwed
And stil had the nerve to ask
Who I was voting for
'Cause when you silence our youth
Then you silence the truth
Our right not to remain, yeah
Start funding lives that move for changes
Not funding leaders that oppress and use
When politicians become nothing but major corporations
Posing as humans, real humans lose

"I look for comfort in the arms of every friend that I have known,

Where is the drug?
Where is the healing?
Where is whatever will ease this pain?
There is nothing I won't swallow
To stop what's eating up my brain
And get my feeling back again
I hear tortured voices buried deep inside of my head,
I have restlessness and anger as a pillow for my bed.
I hope it won't be long 'til I can prove myself to be
Untarnished by what's followin' me
What is followin' me?
Where is the drug?
Where is the healing?
Where is whatever will ease this pain?
There is nothing I won't swallow
To stop what's eating up my brain
And get my feeling back again
What of the prayers that seek to comfort one who's losing her love,
What of her mother's cries that surely she has suffered enough.
And when he's gone where is the justice in a child that knows his name
As a photo in a frame
A picture in a frame
Where is the drug?
Where is the healing?
Where is whatever will ease this pain?
There is nothing I won't swallow
To stop what's eating up my brain
And get my feeling back again
Where is the drug?
Where is the healing?
Where is whatever will ease this pain?
There is nothing she won't swallow
To stop what's eating up her brain
And get my feeling back again

To stop what's eating up our brain

"She won't miss 
What we're taking here tonight
You can't call it stealing when it's been thrown away
Unwanted love left lying will bloom again some day
We found each other lonely baby
Don't that make it right
She won't miss 
What we're taking here tonight
I only want the part of you that's cold from her neglect
I'll warm the spot inside your arms he carelessly rejects
We both need the sunshine baby
To brighten up our lives

"The needle that hurts my heart is getting deeper and deeper
This time so short seems to be infinite so long
But it's so beautiful
And this journey will find its end too
The circumstances even allow it to talk about feelings
Sometimes I think that my heart is filled with my hope and drowned in your compassion
Hopefully just a misunderstanding
Everything I want is inside of you
Everything I dream of lies in your heart
All of my dreams
And the night in your eyes there is a star that shines for me
And it hurts for a lifetime
Like an angel that holds and carries me
And love lets me fall
I stagger
My hand's embrace your body weak
I don't want to hurt you
Silence surrounds us
We look at each other
But our thoughts in this moment stay hidden
I die for you",Metal

"Winter forest
Winter patterns on the trees
Trudging through the horny bushes
Snow is cracking
Underneath my feet
Broken branches
Shadows grey
My eyes can hardly see
So full of tears
Winter forest
I can hear chanting monks
And his heart so cold and silent
Which is calling
Calling me to come
Hungry ravens
Looking down
But I'm still alive
The power of my will
Is my only guide
There within the woods
My friend will be buried
In the burial ground
Outside of monastery
I must see his funeral
I must be there just in time
Getting late and getting dark
Where's the path I cannot find

Fading whispers in the wind
You rest somewhere six feet under
Snow has covered
All the memories
Hungry ravens
Looking down
But I'm still alive
The power of my will
Is my only guide",Metal

Sometimes I think, I'm going insane

Could say I'm glad you're gone
And hope you never come back home
But I know, I just can't lie

Should I leave or stick around?
Am I lost or am I found?
He's throwin' wisdom like a poet
Throwin' tantrums like a child
But when he holds my hand
My pulse runs red and wild
I was a fighter for my freedom
Now a fool for his touch
He is a nightcap, a brunch buzz, and I'm a lush

Next to the nightstand I'm taking every pill he's got
My head, my heart, my throat, my lungs
My stomach all in a knot
I swore off suitors and the never-ending, needless drugs
I learned my lesson and I thought, ""Yeah, I've had enough""
But I'm back on love
Back on love
And I'm losing time, losing weight
I'm a loser for this man
I've been lost since our first date
He is a tight-rope talker, I can't balance at all
He says it's fascinating watching me tip-toe and crawl
He says my ex-boyfriend's boring, he says the moon is the sun
He says anxiety can be the source of lots of fun
My best friend made a list of ways his love is off-track
But I don't give a shit, and I refuse to call that bitch back
He might be missin' in New York
He might be messin' with my head
But I'll do anything to keep him messin' in my bed

I've got witches wavin' in my windows
Sky high, I cry, and swear to quit
I've got witches wavin' in my windows
Sky high, I cry, and swear to quit
I've got witches wavin' in my windows
Sky high, I cry, and swear to quit
He calls me up
He calls me ""moonlight""

quemo en hoguera, hoguera nortena
prendo en caliente, uno no espera
piensa lo que quieras, brinca como puedas
Sigue la buena, rata en condena
todos los que puedan sigan cadena
hecho un poco de lena en la meta
pronto asciende de la A a la Z
alcohol, dolor, agudo es el chillido
mientras subes, se continua enredando el intestino
olor, rencor, grave un estalido
o miro atras o intento otro camino
volando alto, enloquecido
todo es parte, parte es lo mismo
del borde salta hacia el destino
mas es lo mismo sobre lo ocurrido
Quemo bandera, dejo la feria
quemo en hoguera, hoguera nortena
prendo en caliente, uno no espera
piensa lo que quieras, brinca como puedas
Ahora estoy, sentado esperando
si aparece seguiria andando
ahora estoy, tranquilo why calmado
si aparece el tiempo contando
Quemo bandera, dejo la feria
quemo en hoguera, hoguera nortena

Whats up?
Nothing just bangin'.  
What's up wit you?
That's cool
Hey
I just got a call from my momma, you know what I'm saying?
Said she got call from my lawyer
And guess what?

Lawyer just told me, he told me what it is
That bastards not my baby. 
I see you trying to play me,  
I see you trying to play me.  
You know, why me?

I guess you blamed it on the wrong nigga, it ain't mine
I took the test and the results read it, you was lying. 
But you was crying in my motherfucking face
And all the while telling niggas how you fin to get paid off Kray'
Thought you had a bone
Bitch got shit all wrong, a y'all know
I was suspicious from the front door, 
Wasn't surprised when the ho took me to court and say she want do
Now the bitch has got the people in my business, 
They come to find out, ain't even one of my children
You illin, playing with these kids man
You're dead wrong, got this baby calling me daddy
But daddy's a unsolved mystery
Cause apparently mommy ain't caring what she sleeps now
What ya gone do?
Tell her the truth or say I left you, like ho's do


I should of knew your ass was drama
Round here telling everybody yous my baby mama
Saying I'm a buy you this and that like I'm your fucking sponsor
Look your honor, I ain't paying a dime
Because that young'n right there mine
I ain't lying, I ain't no deadbeat daddy, with intent to be neglecting
All I wanted was some sex, but now she trying to get a check
But baby hold on won't you wait a minute
The DNA a read negative, fucking these chickens ain't no way to live
They trying to get up in your pockets and break you down
For 18 years, so who raping who now
Ninety-nine point nine percent not
I mean I ain't that baby father, I ain't gotta be bothered
With all that bullshit you stressing me with, testing my wits
I'm just about to slap in the clip, and do me a bitch
I'm through with this shit, I keep it real with my lady
Now you chickens that play me, don't knock that nigga little Layzie

Catch
Mo-mmy, hey mommy where's my daddy, where's my daddy? 

I chip in, cause I'm chilling enough
Making millions, she wants some do, bitch no!
Go get a J-O-be
Willing to help and I, help yourself for sure
I better play daddy
Coming out a woman in which she never had me
Sadly, always in transition leaving gladly
Shit, I tried to be the papi
Nothin 'gainst the baby, momma can't make me happy
Fuck yeah I'm crazy, my father never knew about me
I was young, while another man mad at me
I got no real fam, maybe it's swelling straight
God I love you Lay', no one get in the way


Why can't we pressure these broads, the way they pressure on us
That paper came and it read that nigga wasn't my son
Why can't we counter sue these bitches on the way they do us
Test one, test two, said I wasn't the one
So you can cancel that money!
Ridin'!, and flossing my money!
Oh, I know you had a plan, lovely!
I hope the real baby daddy live his life, y-eah!
And you can tell your little girlfriend to stay out my face
I see you ain't told her the results of what you got in your case
You get's nada, what you ain't heard
I ain't the real baby's father, not a dollar
I guess the best is the best, somebody would of got hurt
Cause I ain't paying for nothing, I got for free with no work
You so scandalous
Heard about my Benz, look they came and tried to relate us
Damn!

"Girl we've really need to drop it out
Somethings I know I need to say out loud
And we talk about it
There are matters what you need to know

But I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you, out you
I don't want nobody else

I can be unhappy without you, out you

I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you, out you
I hate it when you turn it off and on
When the mornin' love is right then you turned of and the day is gone
It's like a cycle through what's going on
It almost like we don't want it
I'm losing you and I don't know why
Used to feel so good and
Used to be so right and
Used to make love to me every single night
Girl, how can we get back to
That blessful energy
You gotta give me everything
If you wanna be with me

I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
Without you, out you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you
I can be unhappy without you

Used to feel so good and
Used to be so right and
Used to make love to me every single night

"Broken buildings watching over flooded streets where nothing moves
Shelters for the vultures hardly keeping daylight out
Marble stained with rust, faded paintings on the walls
Beaten towers crumble, haunted only by the wind
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man
Picking up the given challenge of the fallen gargoyle angels
Headed on collision course with martyrs tied as fenders
Driving like a mad dog going faster than a bullet
Pulled by gravitation from a million tons of stone
Human insects lived here crawling through the underground
Beehive built in stainless, a cathedral for the slaves
Spineless cowards guided by ideals they couldn't grasp
Giving up their freedom in the hope of being chosen
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man
In the twilight grows the shadow's hollow hands that tries to catch me
Omens can not stop me because all the prophets died
Like the ancient temples their monuments survived them
Speeding through the ruins I left their bridges burning
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man",Pop
"I am white and I've got everything I need
No one clutches their purses when they're in a room alone with me
And I can drive through any neighborhood I please
At any hour, and the police don't do a thing
So, if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight, white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
I'm a guy getting paid more than a girl with a degree
And I can walk in the streets after dark, no one wants to rape me
And I can get a girl pregnant and just as easily flee
Just like my straight, white male dad did to me
So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight, white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
I've got a pile of broken mirrors, and I'm walking under ladders
And I'm spilling tons of salt because to me that doesn't matter
'Cause my skin and my gender and my orientation
Are the best things to have when you live in this nation
I recommend it highly
So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight, white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
Shit's gonna work out for me
I'm a straight, white male in America
I've got all the luck I need",R&B
"Life's been getting harder every day
I don't know what to do or what to say
Nothing seems quite right, I think I lost my fight
Do you think I'll live to see another day?
You know I hate the job that I've been working at
But life just seems to go like that
Out here on my own, well, I feel so alone
Father, won't you let me come home?
Could you help me, father, could you help me out?
Could you show me what to do or what to say?
If you can't I understand, cos I know you're just a man
You're my father, so that's OK
I still don't know what I want to be
The world around me seems so crazy
Criminals in power, the streets no longer safe
What kind of man would I want to be?
There's a girl I love and you know I want to marry
She's everything I hoped she would be
So poppa if you would, give some tips to help me out
So I'll know how to raise a family
Now I know you're not the wisest man to ever walk the earth
But I know Someone who just might be
So I'll stop stressing you with all the questions that I have
I'll go to the One who gave you me",R&B

Time to get even in this unproved life

Time for some answers, beware of my drift

A feast arises, be glad you're invited
The future has no past, pass the wine
All those worries about all those dreams
All those nights when I screamed
Captured in security, a babbling brook
Let's drop a bomb and act like fools
But a true feast arises when you're done
And you're done when prospects are gone
Cause when you're down in the mud cause
dreams won't come, pleasure is gone

He carried it with him everywhere he went
Like a soldier who just couldn't give up the fight
He took it to work, and he brought it back home
He took it so hard, couldn't leave it alone
We all called him crazy in our little town
The way that he carried her memory around
He boxed it up when he sold their old house
It rode right beside him there in the front seat
He littered his new place with those same old heartaches
It felt right at home there with her memory
He took it to church with him three times a week
He took it to bed when he laid down to sleep
The weight of remembering just wore him down
The longer he carried her memory around
When she never came back, he gave up on Jesus
And he never darkened another church door
He took up with whiskey, and he took up with women
'Till one night he just couldn't take anymore
He cried, ""God forgive me, but I've lost my will""
As he reached for that cold empty piece of blue steel
Then he put another big hole in his heart
The night that he carried her memory too far",Country

Spread the love, don't try to make things worse

Don't blame yourself you did a hell of a job, impeccable

So I pray for comfortable rest for the people that still depressed
Look, never take your life for granted
You don't know what trials and tribulations you might be handed

I've been through hell and back
But I'm kneeling down and I'm hoping you hear me now
Bring them babies back in Nigeria

"Sketch of your faces I still don't know you, you aren't permanent. You want all of our moments stolen, blind alleys and hallways to basements. How are you gonna hide till you disappear?
Because nothing and nowhere is golden.
Apartments are cages I still don't know what is permanent. Maybe all my possesions were precious. Truth is, all my possesions, I somehow lost them. Been travelling so light, when we're floating it seems nothing and nowhere is golden.
Some say we're lost in space, some say we're falling off the page
Some say our life is insane but it isn't insane on paper
Playgrounds are graveyards and all of our scars are permanent. There's no replacement for places. I'll always love you, you're mine. Numb is the new high, all memories die out 'till nothing and nowhere is golden.",Rock

I'll have said goodbye,
To wind and rain, it's all the same,
In my mind.

Far across the sea.
Away from snow, and all I know,
Left behind.
How slow the days go,
When you don't come around anymore.
I'll wait for sunlight in the grey.
By of the end of winter,
Day and night subside.
The spring will come and bring the sun,
For a while.
Summer passed unnoticed.
Autumn's come and gone.
And rain will start and break my heart,
Like before.
How slow the nights go,
When you don't come around anymore.

thousands of doomed, empty animas bound to the tyrant's will.
The sand castle is raised: the sand castle must be brought down.

With insincerity they led their so called supremacy right at our feet.
Who will protect their beloved families when our vengeance unleashes?
The hangmen implore for amnesty as their lives depend on a mere trigger pull.
At this point of my journey I can't discern between mercy and scorn; place
your bets, let's play roulette with my heart as the croupier. Will this be the
time for the final retaliation or will my pride submit to my regret once again?
To the rhythm of another song about honor and purity, I close my eyes and

"-Mommy?
-Yes Son?
-Where does dirt come from?
-Dirt comes from: The Worms.
-Wow! Awesome!
There is a chipmunk
At the center of the earth
And in his big oven
He bakes his own desserts
He warms the ocean
And from that, life springs forth
Little organisms building trash around the clock
Compost heaps
Or melting pots
For Farmer John's
Smoked Sausage stocks
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And all of the roots have a place to sleep now
All the chanuks have squash to eat now
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And people hold hands and feel terrific
Food comes from dirt
It's scientific
Yeah! Wow!
There's so much to learn!
The Sun came from a cave
And it made the clouds go by

The clouds had a conference
And rain fell from the sky

Worms got thirsty
From eating too much dirt

They came up through the ground
And got eaten by the birds

Some worms escaped
With their lives

They excreted soil
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And all of the roots have a place to sleep now
All the chanuks have squash to eat now
Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
And people hold hands and feel terrific
Food comes from dirt
It's scientific
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE IS AWESOME!

Riot riot riot your fucking self right to the bank

And by the way what the fuck does the radio have to do with it
Just another clever trick they got to hush the humming masses
While they buy buy buy this weeks overplayed trash
Is today green or tomorrow fucking greener?
For the bosses making money while your spewing out crap love songs
What the fuck is punk about road managers and booking
Agents or backstage rooms and pre show exercises
Twenty thousand seat arenas..oh c'mon you make me fucking sick

Oh, you don't have to go there, with your big, plastic nose
What about your big ass head?
What about your buck ass teeth?
Your moms so black, I looked at her and thought that I was asleep
Your nasty ass moms gave me ear infection over the phone

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends
Why can't we just get along?

"JENNIFER GENTLE
There were three sisters, fair and bright,
Jennifer gentle, fair Rosie Marie,
Wanted to wed with a valiant Knight
As the dew flies over the mulberry tree.
The eldest sister took him in,
Also bolted the silver pin.
The second sister made his bed,'
Placed the pillow right under his head.
But the youngest sister, fair and bright,
Wanted to wed with the valiant knight.
Well, if you will answer my questions three,
Then, fair maid, I would marry thee.
Oh, what is whiter than the milk?
What is softer than the silk?
Oh, snow is whiter than the silk;
Down is softer than the silk.
And what is sharper than the thorn?
What is louder than the horn?
Oh, hunger is sharper than the thorn,
Thunder's louder than the horn.
And what is broader than the way?
What is deeper than the sea.
Oh, love is broader than the way;
hell is deeper than the sea.
Well, now you've answered my questions three;
Now, fair maid, I would marry thee.

"I would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it would change your mind

I've said too much
Been too unkind
I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try and
Laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness
Plead with you
But I know that
It's too late
And now there's nothing I can do
I would tell you
That I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
That you've already
Gone away
Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more
Now I would do most anything
To get you back by my side

Keep on laughing

Find truth beyond the flesh
Fleeting past my dreams of unfulfilled desire

See me die to rise with the gods again

"She didn't look so pretty as some other I have known
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of making me believe that I belong
And it felt like coming home when I found her
She seemed to be so proud of me, just walking, holding hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feeling warm when I loved her
She brightened up the day like the early morning sun
And she made what I was doing seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever done
And it made me want to smile when I loved her
Some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the wind
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand why I lost her, she brightened up the day

"Today I sat alone at the window and I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today
So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes go dim
Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him
I don't wanna play house I know it can't be fun
I watched mommy and daddy and if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house it makes my mommy cry
Cause when she played house my daddy said goodbye

All these girls got extensions, even with the long hair
Everybody trippin', we mix Ciroc with Patron here
Don't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang

"Well, they called him Super Skier
As he sat around the sun-deck,
For he swore that he would never take a spill
When they finally took him down
They had to use three toboggans
To carry all the pieces down the hill

He was comin' down that slope
Goin' ninety miles an hour
When he caught an edge of his ski
Well, his clothes, they were fast,
But the slopes, they were faster
That's the last of Super Skier we shall see
Well, he hollered, ""What the hell!""
As he put 'em parallel
He figured there was nothing else to learn

And as he started on his way,
He was shoutin', ""Andele!"",
Assuming that he'd never have to turn.
Well, he was slippin' down that slope
Goin' ninety miles an hour
When a mogul flipped him in the air
His jumping form was fine
Until he ran into that pine,
And two one-legged skiers left from there

When he left that tree at last,
He was moving twice as fast
Both halves were skimming
Moguls like a feather
He said, ""If I must be
A split personality,
How can I ever keep my knees together?""
One ski was headed east,
And the other headed west,
'Cause both of them, you see,
Were running freer
And folks up on Little Nell
Looked up, scared as hell,
Said, ""It's a bird."" ""No, it's a
Plane."" ""It's Super Skier!""

Now the moral of my story
Though my story's kinda gory
Is very simple even to a dope
You buy the fastest clothes you can,
Then talk skiing like a man,
But don't let people catch you on the slope!

Well he was comin' down that slope
Goin' ninety miles an hour
When he caught an edge of his ski
Well, his clothes they were fast
But the slopes, they were faster
That's the last of Super Skier we shall see
That's the last of super skier we shall see!",Folk

Love in her heart and a smile on her face
She's the world to me
Heaven is all my heart can see

Heaven is just a kiss away
I was so lonely till she took my hand
She lifted in my eyes and she made me understand
Here comes heaven like spring soft and warm
I'd give my life to keep her from harm
She makes my heart sing
Here comes heaven again

"Pebble by pebble
Sand grain by sand grain
Shore turns to sea
Shore turns to ocean
Serpent creates the high tides
To assure all good is floating
Good and righteousness is not intellectual
And the fabric that's good cannot be proven
And so that fabric is washed away
Far from the shore from which it was woven
The shore is a place where persons live
Sowing fabrics that's a tangent of the real one
Not wearable to most of the persons on shore
In fact, it's only wearable to the person of one
One person under an oath
An oath to a serpent, an evil snake
In search for being as powerful as God
And all God's good he'll try to take
He'll try to take
He'll try to take
Good being washed away
Love being washed away
Most of the persons follow the serpent
Cause the serpent preaches all for self
But why follow someone in search of something
When you'll get nothing
Serpent's all for self
Some are dumb, some know no better
Some believe there is no Lord
The serpent uses this knowledge to help him
And wash away more of the shore
Serpent knows once shores are gone
There's nothing left but ocean and sea
A few persons trying to save the shore
Some of those persons are A.D
Saving the shores means saving the faith
The faith that there is a mighty someone
Someone much more mighty than the serpent
In fact there's someone that created everyone
Up the ocean without a paddle
Is the fabric of God, the righteous clothing
And you wear non-righteous clothes of the serpent
Naively we keep on serving
The ocean's owned by the serpent
We can stop being washed away
Why we let them wash it away
Why are we allowing them to take what's good
Why don't we teach our children what's good
Why don't we collect and save what is real
Look very hard and swim the ocean
We must find what needs to be found
Look all around and find a wise man
To feed us the truth and keep us sound
All of us must swim the seas
Coz our path's been washed away
All of us must swim the seas
Cause our path's been washed away
My only purpose is to swim the seas
Find the truth and spread it around
Give it to the children that know how to listen
So they can pass it after I drown
We can stop being washed away
Sand grain by sand grain, pebble by pebble
We can stop this, we can stop
Can you help us
Will you help us
Please
Help us stop being washed away
All of us must swim the sea
All of us
Hey
Can you help us
Will you help us
Ooh please help us",Hip-Hop

not worth praying

"Blow the last candle out. Let the wax harden
I wish I could stop crying. And I wish that someone still loved me 
Just breathe and focus. How can I when the air is so cold and empty,
That my lungs froze right in my chest.
I'll be honest the silver linings are getting harder and harder to manufacture
And the smiles are so difficult to fake. 
What do I have to do, or who do I have to kill, to get what I want. What I need 
Happiness is an emotion I was born to this world without,
nothing pleases me. And i can never be satiated.
Through this toil I will breed my own distress and destroy my best hopes,
fuck up the only things that I love.
I watched my aspirations crashing to the ground, on the backs of the angels that I've slain.
But I meant so well, I tried so hard, gave everyting in my soul, to what end, to what end
Desolation, desire, exhale, pass away. ",Rock

"On this I stand
Two sets of footprints placed ahead of the dirt softened from tear drops
And overlooking the earth as the son of the moon
protected by a forcefield of pure thought.. On this I stand
A rally of unemployed disgruntled words spawned from long journeys through somewhere
somewhere that only causes me pain as I strain my soul crammin it with 
so I could bring some there.
I bleed the blood of a cold stone that roams without a shadow
I'm only deep enough to realize that I'm shallow
My head I keep it up but its hard to keep it straight
when you don't believe in love,
and you just cant cope with hate
Metal rust, leaves turn into dust,
as the difference between love and lust clarifies as trust
if you only had an hour to sum your whole life up
would you spend that hour sayin that an hour ain't enough
I've escaped the shell that bound me to cowardness
now I'm faithful to the wind but compared to it I'm powerless
the first step was made, and it was a fair accomplishment
the pond was sittin still, so I threw a rock in it
and as my reflection rippled it all became clear
the seasons always change so there's no reason for fear
we made an autobiography of our pivotal years
its all I got and I'm giving it you because I care
See, a lot of the time humans as artists exist in a self-projected state of falsehood
were either too close to our image to stay objective in our perception,
or too far away to be subjective in any matter
this only widens the void in social conformity
introduced to our souls at birth and so I write.
I don't write without the intention of objectivity
or attention on the image
but only as an omni directional bridge
between the several 
realities present in comprable space and time.
see I don't write for the future,
I write about the future, for the present
I write with my past, about the future, for the present.
On this I stand
The oasis of a limbo adjacent to my generation, facing out the window
waiting for some ventilation, patient while the wind blows
graceful in its demonstration, overall innovation.
On this I stand
A fountain of youth sovereignty,  syllables more than a pound of flesh
deep breath of achievement, a dream and a wake up call
another haul of the quest.
On this I stand
Another loved civilization.
On this I stand
The purity of creation.
On this I stand
A paradigm for self.
On this I stand
I thank you for your help.
On this I stand
My first born child.
On this I stand
Something for now.
On this I stand
Life, love, death and hate.
On this I stand

Can never heal a hurting human soul

Only yesterday he helped me type
He told me everything
Everything's gonna be alright
Oh, he said he loved me and he cried
Oh yeah, he said he loved me and he cried
Oh, yes he did now
There must be an explanation
Come on and move out the station
Can't you see that he's taking my world
And making me a sad sad girl
That's why I can't let go

I was takin' my time
I was chilly the most contemplating and debating about what I should do
I made a sharp left turn
And there was my crew lookin' for a Def Jam in order to rock
Because it's gonna hit the fan at 12:00 o'clock
Then there was this flygirl,she said she wanted to know
Why are you all dressed up with no place to go?
She said she'd take us to a place where we could hear some hip hop
But little did we know she meant the house that rocked
The house that rocked
She was a real flygirl,dressed in leather and lace
She looked pale ""Yo"",I thought it was paint on her face
She said it was the last house,corner rockin' bird lane
But you might need a cross and a little wolfsbane
Well we were at the door
And when it opened inside there were freaks galore
Their eyes glowed as if lit by an eerie light
I said ""I don't think I should have came here tonight""
And when I asked her what was up,he door slammed and locked
She was gonne and we were,trapped inside the house that rocked
The house that rocked
Zombies were on the floor and what do ya know
They were doin' the Pee-Wee Herman,what a real creep show
Creatures were playin' cards 
Somebody screamed 
Now Lurch was rockin' the mix and on his shirt it read
The music hideously provided for the living dead
Now they was illin' and that was no doubt
But all we wanted to do was get out
I was wishing I was chillin' back around the block
Instead of running for my life inside the house that rocked
The house that rocked
It was a grizzly situation,very gruesome indeed
And would you believe tha walls started to bleed
Frankstein was steady scheming as he left the room
In came the Mummy and the creature from the black Lagoon
They said ""Your time has come"" you could scream and can holler
But you're never gonna leave this little shop of horror
You can think that it's a joke to have a heart full of fear
But you feel that way because you're not here

The power of a gun can kill, and the power of fire can burn
The power of wind can chill, and the power of mind can learn
The power of anger, can raise inside until it tears you apart
But the power of a smile, especially yours, can heal a frozen heart

And tomorrow, we'll wake up with the promise of a smile, smile
Yes, maybe tomorrow, we'll wake up with the promise, of a smile

Rest in peace..
Tupac, Bone Thugs
In His Own Words
Let's go

And tomorrow, morrow, morrow, and tomorrow, morrow
And tomorrow, morrow, and tomorrow we

I see the light... 
I can see the light... 
I see the light... 
See the light that shines... 

Well, we still looking for better days
Hoping tomorrow can bring us some bigger and better things
So we can escape this maze, and they give us our change in every way
And maybe tomorrow, can bring us the truth
and there'll be no more use, for the pain and sorrow
Let's put it to use and then maybe the youth, can come and follow
And we can leave all our problems in the bottle, tomorrow
Maybe god'll wipe our eyes and we'll never have to cry no more
Or even better, have to die no more
Politicians can't tell us lies no more, he decides no more
Maybe tomorrow, it can be our daylight
Just might be our sunshine, sunshine..
Yesterday is filled with so much misery and drama
And today it don't seem like I'm getting any further
Praying tomorrow we can somehow come out of the struggle
And need no more hustle, no stumblin cause we all one muscle..
Still looking for a better day, day, and a better way, way, way..
So let's hope tomorrow... can lead us to the place we tryin to be..
In heavenly harmony, in heavenly harmony!


Where there's a will there's a way, don't let it stand in your way
Look 'em straight in they face, let 'em know you ain't playing no games
We searching for better days, wanna live them better ways
What I promise, heart is all you need to rock
Be honest, succeed, just look at me!
If I can do it, you can do it, we can do it, just believe, believe, believe!
When I lay down, I think about some of the wrong things I done
So I pray now, for God to erase some of that wrong
Wipe my soul clean, to be wanted, when he calls me, when he calls me!
So I can't sleep, cause I'm worried, I done did things, lord forgive me!
It's a damn shame, the things we do to get it our way!
Snitch on thugs, just to get it, your pay!
Nowadays I act right, in the past we used to fight
Where the loyalty at? Where them real street thugs? Where the thug life?
Where there's a will there's a way!


So as the hours pass by, in the event of my demise
Tell my momma not to cry, these are the words of the wise
Look at liberty needing glasses now that the promise been broken
For the better, keep on hopin, powerful words that's spoken
What I'm quotin is a G, acquired his knowledge from the streets
Makaveli, Tupac Shakur, was the rose that grew from concrete
America's most complete artist, regardless, one of the hardest
On a mission to make it better, with the soul of Malcom and Martin
Mixed with a little Garvin, today he got us callin
Our brighter star is fallen, but now before he was ballin
Out of control, quick to let a nigga know what he stood for, be a friend or foe
And I bring the truth in the booth cause ain't nobody gon help me
This is life, it's a gamble, and I'ma scramble till my pockets wealthy
Fuck what they tell me, I'm all about my biz
Bitch, street biz or showbiz, I'ma make y'all know this
And I'ma say this to every man, woman and child
Don't you ever be afraid to smile, smile for me now
And I'ma say this to every man, woman and child
Don't you ever be afraid to smile... the power of a smile!

Watch her tear at the label
From the bottle that she just drank dry

It took a long time but she's learning

But her mind is on another
And just look what he's done to her pride
And if she should change her mind
Give up the music and the wine
I'll be standing by to be the next in line
I know her favorite songs so well
And she's happy, I can tell
Just as long as she can hear the jukebox play
So I'll keep playing it loud

"Raise up the ghosts of the dead I won't die like them
Push past the point of raw emotion I will breathe
Exist with a broken spirit I will die complete
Ignore what the angels say enjoy that special place where the demons speak to me
I won't pick out the lining of my coffin yet unless I am sure that color satin is me
Better yet go with crushed velvet, that way I'll be damn sure to enjoy eternity
My daily life writes the eulogy, engraved on tombstone diaries
laid to rest with the passing of time
Seems to me that even love can die
And the rituals, that fade away, and the roses that cease to be laid
And to me it clearly appears that we're already one foot in a very shallow grave
I will love with passion

I'm out there chasing my dreams lookin' for a place to go 
Tryin' to get up out the ghetto come follow with my footsteps

Lead you to the cell or lead you to a grave

Apart from that I wish to see you succeed

I thought you how to share em, when fucking with hot hos
Thought you how to rock right shit up on your toes

"Why is it that as we grow older and stronger
The road signs point us adrift and make us afraid
Saying ""You never can win,"" ""Watch your back,"" ""Where's your husband?""
Oh, I don't like the signs that the sign makers made.
So I'm going to steal out with my paint and brushes
I'll change the directions, I'll hit every street
It's the Tinseltown scandal, the Robin Hood vandal
She goes out and steals the king's English
And in the morning you wake up and the signs point to you
They say
""I'm so glad that you finally made it here,""
""You thought nobody cared, but I did, I could tell,""
And ""This is your year,"" and ""It always starts here,""
And oh ""You're aging well.""
Well I know a woman with a collection of sticks
She could fight back the hundreds of voices she heard
And she could poke at the greed, she could fend off her need
And with anger she found she could pound every word.
But one voice got through, caught her up by surprise
It said, ""Don't hold us back, we're the story you tell,""
And no sooner than spoken, a spell had been broken
And the voices before her were trumpets and tympani
Violins, basses and woodwinds and cellos, singing
""We're so glad that you finally made it here
You thought nobody cared, but we did, we could tell
And now you'll dance through the days while the orchestra plays
And oh, you're aging well.""
Now when I was fifteen, oh, I knew it was over
The road to enchantment was not mine to take
'Cause lower calf, upper arm should be half what they are
I was breaking the laws that the sign makers made.
And all I could eat was the poisonous apple
And that's not a story I was meant to survive
I was all out of choices, but the woman of voices
She turned round the corner with music around her,
She gave me the language that keeps me alive, she said:
""I'm so glad that you finally made it here
With the things you know now, that only time could tell
Looking back, seeing far, landing right where we are
And oh, you're aging, oh and I am aging,
Oh, aren't we aging well?""",Indie

Here inside of the torture and pain
For the cries of the world and the last lives remain
Hear your heart's way to die for the game
Deep inside slowly fading away
And the last breath's in vain and the fear turns to rage
Locked in the world by the fallen evil souls
Torn right apart from the roughly seam
Breaking my mind now to bring my life to war
Reach out and die with the flames
See through the lives of the red hot stabbing eyes

We fly free so far from here there's one thing we'll relay
And dreams of everlasting pain the fallen now rise again
Through the fire, through the flames like the sun we'll rise again
Lost in time, lost in space to the end of other days
See their endless ways: insanity
The quest will rage, not meant to be
In flames of hell forevermore eternally

So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside
Now feel your soul lost in scenes of all eternity
Every day of this life, defending
And the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain
So alone in the world far away, memories of the dream will remain
As the world's falling cold and your life's all in vain
Fire in your soul will forever rise again
Nothing in your mind to remember now
Held here by the fear of the dark land calling
Fly free on endless seas, the final curtain falls
On the ground from down below, the time to lock and to load
Through the fire, through the rain, far across the distant plains
Feel the wind beneath the steel as your mind becomes insane
Save the hate of all humanity, their eyes belong to destiny
For freedom now we rise alone again

So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside
And when the memories are all left behind
And the days are gone forever, lost within my mind
Now feel your soul burn in scenes of all eternity

"Wandering restless through the hillside on a cold December day, my solitary journey guided only by the pilgrims high in the sky.
Fog invades the lands blocking the last rays of the dying sun and a veil of mist and serenity gracefully covers the night.
The shadowy trees of the forest, once imbued with beauty and life now twisted and eternally frozen by a shroud of snow and ice.
As the glow of the dawning sun vanishes in the witherd sky my eyes wander up through the whispering winds and watch the glare of the stars dilute.
Exposed to the frost of the icy winds my bittered soul still rejoys.
As the howl of the wind enchants me more than the sweetest sounding human voice.
Freed from mens insanity I feel my grief stricken heart still burn bracing my soul through night's loneliness I sence a glimpse of shelter return.
Burdend with the insight of my loneliness I continue my journey through this night.
Passed have the times when the glimmer of hope filled my heart with gentle delight.
All the years that the currents of fortune have planted the seeds of my grief my eyes have been fooled by the masks of joy, my desperate hopes deceived.
So let us now gather the harvest of the past solitary days.
And bath our peace craving eyes in sin's magnificent grace.
The night shall pass and a cold morning breeze shall obscure the traces of my pittyful existence.
For not a stone shall mark the place where silence embraced me and guided my cheerful soul into the charm of everlasting solitude.",Metal

"The winter had passed
And the spring has come
We have withered
And our hearts are bruised from longing

Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow

The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds, oh oh
Under the same sky, at different places
Because you and I are dangerous
I am leaving you
One letter difference from Ã¢ÂÂnim'^
It's cowardly but I'm hiding because I'm not good enough
Cruel breakup is like the end of the road of love
No words can comfort me
Perhaps my lifetime's last melodrama
Now it's final curtain is coming down
I was born and I met you
And I have loved you to death
My cold heart that has been dyed blue
Even with my eyes closed, I can't feel you
The winter had passed
And the spring has come
We have withered
And our hearts are bruised from longing

Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow

The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds, oh oh
I feel like my heart has stopped beating
You and I, frozen there, after a war
Trauma, that has been carved in my head
Once these tears dry up, I will moistly remember my love
I'm neither painful nor lonely
Happiness is all self-talk
I can't stand something more complicated
It's no big deal, I don't care
Inevitable wandering, people come and go
I was born and I met you
And I have loved you to death
My cold heart that has been dyed blue
Even if you have left, I'm still here

Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow

The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds, oh oh
Again tonight, underneath that blue moonlight
I will probably fall asleep alone
Even in my dreams, I look for you
And wander around while singing this song

Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow

The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds, oh oh

Used to the blue tears, blue sorrow

The love that I have sent away with the floating clouds, oh oh",Pop
"I was in love with your beauty from the day you walked my way
Oh how I wish that was enough to have made me want to stay
See I'm as true as I want to be and I must say my girl
I tried the best to give to you all of the truest in the world
But when I left your house that morning in that ragged Thunderbird
I tried so hard to fight the voices from the devil's that I heard
See there's a highway to the right of us I took it a year ago
And since a year ago can't drive past, without turning down that road
And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong
So give me a try at describing just how difficult it is
When you kinda love two girls to figure out which one you miss
Stumble away from your stairway with your perfume on my clothes
Well I kinda loved two girls but now I've kinda lost 'em both
And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong
And if I could gather up the damage that I rendered in my life
Place it on a scale and weigh against the damage done that night
Then it'd be safe to say the weight of all I did and didn't do
Would surely float against the lightest wrong I ever did to you",Country
"The sun goes down in Calvin county
Neon lights from an old beer sign
Shown through the window out on the sidewalk
As I walked in to pass the time;
I looked around, sat down at a table
Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine
And through the door came a little old lady
She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime.
Paper Rosie, Paper Rosie
She sold you Paper Roses, but they only cost a dime.
Silver hair that's lost its' Gold
Trembling hand as she passed the rose
Red Crepe paper, made nature's bouquet
Help a little old lady buy a rose today;
I took the rose from her trembling hand
With eyes of age, she smiled and walked away
Like a breath of spring I could smell the rose
It came alive and I heard her say.
Buy my Roses, pretty roses
They're only made of paper
But they only cost a dime.
I went to look for her outside
A spray of roses lay by her side
The sky lit up and the choir sang
A thousand voices as the church bells rang.
They sang Rosie , paper Rosie 
She sold you Paper Roses
But they only cost a dime.

With a clip to claw
Wouldn't draw McGraw
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw
A naughty shorty, sporty with a forty
A laddy takin' tours, just to plan an orgy
A nasty critter, any hoe hitter
Hated my babysitter cause she wouldn't let me hit her

Here comes the switch dome chrome
Couldn't hang with the king
Out the rudder but I call for a yes y'all toots
My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush
I face ya fact throw a heck just like woody wooder
And if I left that means I should of booger
Here's a new track, for all the new jacks
I'm kickin' it the hardest so gimmie my shoes back
So I live when I step it's the pimp
And I rep so make a right and get left quick
So try to play strong and long gone
The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong
Get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it.

Ooooooh a new jack! a new jack!
Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat
Back back smack, here comes a witty black
Endin' in a skull high I'm bout to show why
Eazy's fillin' caps cause my gat's in the low ride
Bang when the gat sneaks, two in the back seat
My homie rides shotgun waitin' to spot one
Duh is a fool who don't ride to slide to a ride
I'm shudder shakin' the place when I start hey
So don't butter, Eazy-E but a park hey
The only thing to flow these now to be fly is a feather
I see the smilin' faces of while they sick

"Can you not see what you've done?
You gave your heart away like that.
I didn't want to fall in love with anyone, but you did.
I can still hear the song,
The melody behind the kiss you gave me.
You were wrong, I was right so I walked away,
And left you there, alone
I got so tired of talkin' on the telephone,
How many times would we say the words goodbye
I made mistakes, and one was telling you that I'd be there,
When telling time had come,
I should've said I didn't care.
Oh, the time I would have saved,
If I had been less willing to accommodate,
You'd been a little less likely to cry.
You go back to the high life,
And I'll go back to the low.
I should've known, but now I know
There'll be no word from you,
Describing how it felt to go through what I put you through.
It all makes perfect sense.

That kept you dangling from such pitiful amounts of hope
I would have cut it too.",Country
"The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
 in a glass of cherry wine
 for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights
 in a different atmosphere
 but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights",Country
"Take a ride with me, take a ride with me
Man it was just the other day everything was all good
Remember like yesterday when we were chillin' in the hood
Dreaming of bigger things as a younger nigga should
Wanna take care of the fam' we just wishin' that we could
Another day and a dollar, steady chasin' the commas
Studios went for hours I'm snappin' like a piranha
Only was seventeen, but loyalty what I honoured
Ridin' round in that bubble ? for drama
Man I put that on my life that's my muthafuckin' dog
Anything want problems that's the nigga I will call
Just know he comin' runnin' with that shit that'll clear the mall
Young and thugging he bustin' if you ever playin foul
Me and four fifth were brothers, felt like we dun' done it all
Then one day in the studio is when I got the call
Man it was o' nine when I lost my dawg
And still to this day the tears continue to fall
I love my nigga, see the pain still remain
Know you watchin' from heaven how far that your nigga came
So I tatted your name to show you I'll never change
Progress the aim ?

Don't give a damn about
Got a few haters so the tool on tuck
Got a small circle, all we ask is trust
Me and my dogs, and all we got is us
Pour a lil' liquor, forget about the pain
A lot of niggas in the dirt, so the sky's where we aim
But now we got the money, the power and the fame
Shit done changed, now we ridin' down memory lane
It's just me and my dogs and we ridin' down memory lane
Memory lane, we in that all white Range
It's just me and my niggas and we ridin' down memory lane
Down memory lane, and we just ridin' down memory lane
And I just gotta keep it real I'm telling you how I feel
Talking before the deal when I was back in the field
'Member we used to chill ? me and my nigga Dale
He attending the school a student at full sale
We visited his crib a couple days and we bail
Hit a couple of clubs and then a couple of girls
God damn my nigga them the mufuckin' Dades
Lord just tell me why you had to take my dog
They just wanted this car, they just wanted to ball
He just wanted to leave, frightened by what he saw
I was off in the room awaiting my nigga call
Not knowing that's the last time that we would even talk
I told 'em to be safe and sent them deuces to my dog
A couple hours later got an unexpected call
My homie he was crying, I knew that it was bad
He told me Dale gone, you're lying out your ass
I called his cell phone but nobody hittin' back
They say that he was shot, dyin' to make it out
He died on the scene that's when I hit my knees
Begging the Lord please, heavenly Father please
So listen to a dream, tell me how could it be
Probably because of me, I'm who he wanted to see
Man a couple years ago is when I lost my dog
And still to this day the tears continue to fall
I love my nigga, see the pain still remain
Know you watchin' from heaven how far that your nigga came
So I tatted your name to show you I'll never change

Is I'm stronger than before
Baby, on my knees, but I still believe
These broken wings will soar
Undone, my silhouette, it's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks
Through oceans dark
Undone, my silhouette, it's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets to sink like shipwrecks

See wat happens when you push me pussy
I warned you, told you not to f**ck around

Stricktigic I show you motherf**ka's my chess move
Believe it I'm not that rapper nigga you used to
That hammer hit that shell that hollow tip will go threw you.

I prepare for the worst, and wish for the best

Shines for you
It's giving off sparks
But that's nothing new
The electric heart
Spins it's lightning web
The spider's sparkle
Lights the way ahead
I eat the biscuts
A gift from her
I eat the fishes
They got no fur
The open road
Of God's final town
I'll take a little sip
From its honey drip
The earth-hurt skies
Say your name
The earth was dry
Until you came

A happy belly begins to glow
The electric sky
Combing in the snow
He's always high
He's a gentle soul

With Christmas legs
And cold, cold beards
And frozen heads
We keep them shiny
We keep them shown
'Cause though they're tiny
They're valuable
Now I've lost my nails
But that's nothing new
And goddamn thumbs
Thumbs, goddamn you
And if all else fails
To win the race
Then someone else for sure
Will take my place
Now flung from dreams
Your voice reappears
And it almost seems
Like you're almost here
Singing an ancient chant
That spreads its dusty legs
And I'm coming in

Electric heart

"Seeping gas from a broken line
Chokes the midnight air
Pilot light will ignite
So begins the reign of terror
Flashing fire blazing hot
Exploding flames did blow
Sleeping innocent unaware
Caught inside the inferno
Burning
On fire
Burning
Burning down
Fire in the night
Fire in the night
Fleeing fast from flickering flames
Escaping death and cremation
Fire fighters set to battle
To control the situation
Fire in the night
They watched their dreams go up in smoke
A lifetime's work laid waste
And all that once lay dear to them
In embers lay erased
In embers lay erased

Deep inside distorted mirrors
Searching for the out
Another chance to feed you the day dream

Every waking moment sells a lie
We're hooked on a gimmick, buying our lives
Setup in the loop of selling you to you
Every thought and emotion
Just lacks something authentic

"When I want to go somewhere, I don't ask forgiveness
I just go where I like, and he knows that.
I walk alone into any party, I'm alone tonight
In that high-heeled ego old hat.
Oh blue night, laughter at the bell toll.
People move like streaks of charcoal.
Someone found a prince in the punchbowl.
But high times fizzle out in a change of heart,
And we know things fall apart.
The morning's off to a bad start.
It's raining. Have you had nights like this?
I run miles to his place, wake him up to look at his face.
I feel astray, and I love it when it gets that way.
The child is so young, they say that child is truly free
And with a mind of perpetual invention.
So why is it now I'm a grown-up, all grown up
And yet now I fly through the ceilings of convention?
Oh new friend, borne out of a mind-cloud.
Make believe and yet I laugh aloud.
I've cried when you have stood ground.
But sometimes playtimes are a ghost I've faced,
In that room that I've erased.
The air is empty and druglaced.
I am completely gone. Are you still with me, then?
With my head so big and awfully,
Take my hand and lead me softly,
And then you stay, and I love it when it gets that way.
And when I was crazy maybe I wanted, I wanted, I wanted to be steady as an iceberg,
And with nowhere fast a-going.
Now, now I can handle the danger zone with hailstones all a-flying,
And the crazy winds a-blowing.
These days I haven't been smoking my lungs brown,
Have that itch to turn my life around,
Maybe move on to a new town.
Cause good friends lifted me out of an early tomb.,
Pulled my life out from its doom,
Like sun into a big room
And where my roots have grown.
I really can't let go
Through the woods and through the fields climb
Up the mountain into nighttime,
Into the day, and I love it when it gets that way.",Indie

"You steady me
Slow and sweet, we sway
Take the lead and I will follow
Finally ready now
To close my eyes and just believe
That You won't lead me
Where You don't go
When my faith gets tired
And my hope seems lost
You spin me round and round
And remind me of that song
The one You wrote for me
And we dance
And I've been told
To pick up my sword
And fight for love
Little did I know
That Love had won for me
Here in Your arms
You still my heart again
And I breathe You in
Like I've never breathed 'till now
When my faith gets tired
And my hope seems lost
You spin me round and round
And remind me of that song
The one You wrote for me
And we dance
And we dance
And we dance
Just you and me
And I will lock eyes
With the One who's ransomed me
The One who gave me joy for mourning
And I will lock eyes
With the One who's chosen me
The One who set my feet to dancing

Oh we dance
We dance
We dance, we dance
Oh we dance
Just You and me

It's taking over my brain, it's taking over control
There's no use in fighting, I'm feeling like a titan
This shit is so electric man
I should be throwing lightening
So count me out of your life
And take it to the bank
And put your arms up if you're down to join the ranks

You can't wear out your welcome if you don't stay

"My song for you this evening
Is not to make you sad
Nor for adding to the sorrows
Of this troubled northern land
But lately, I've been thinking
And it just won't leave my mind
I'll tell you about two friends one time
Who were both good friends of mine
Isaac, he was Protestant
And Sean was Catholic born
But it never made a difference
For the friendship, it was strong
And sometimes in the evening
When they heard the sound of drums
They said, they won't divide us
We will always be as one
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together
It was on a Sunday morning
When the awful news came 'round
Another killing had been done
Just outside Newry town
We knew that Isaac danced up there
We knew he liked the band
But when we heard that he was dead
We just could not understand
Now fear, it filled the countryside
There was fear in every home
When late at night, a car came
Prowling 'round the Ryan Road
A Catholic would be killed tonight
To even up the score
Oh Christ, it's young Macdonald
They have taken from the door
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together
Isaac was my friend, he cried
He begged them with his tears
But centuries of hatred
Have ears that do not hear
An eye for an eye
That was all that filled their minds
And another eye for another eye
Till everyone was blind
Now I don't know where the moral is
Or where the song should end
But I wonder just how many wars
Are fought between good friends
And those who give the orders
Are not the ones to die
It's Scott and young Macdonald
And the likes of you and I
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together",Folk
"Oh love
Right from the start
You were old love
Like we've never been parted
You kissed me
Your hands down my side to my hips
Still shivers inside
All the breathing
From your mouth through mine
About how long
There's hunger for one more time
Lover of mine, when I kissed you
I felt so good, tell this tale to me
Well I won't believe
That I'm already here
Tell this tale to me
No, I won't believe
That we're already here
Oh love, you covered my skin
With your eyes as they found me
I kissed you, danced in your sand
And fell into a never ending moment
And the whisper from your mouth through mine
With those words that gently filled my lungs
Lover of mine, when I'm with you
I forget how am I to being lonely
Living without you
Spend another day passing by you
Don't wanna know how it feels if I do

Stay with a heckler and  protector, 9 mm behead ya
Charge your bitch like a testler or should I say bill collector?
Got more gold than the treasures, I'm a monster like uncle Fester
When it comes to my family, I go back to pushin' that candy

Never rollover, or tell, do my time, go to jail
Showin', improvin', we never losin', we gamed up, never lamed up
Bitches be lovin' the way we play, we movin' fire up like a firetruck

But never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original
This ain't no gangsta song for you to sing along

Like Ghetties, I'm into pitri, bitch, I'm a boss, I'm a fixture
I can tell you who real and who phoney, who counterfeit, who a mark
And I got a black belt in grittin'
A purple heart in street smart

I'm a OG in the game and I'm havin' my grille cheese
You could tell by the way my diamonds be shinin' when I say cheese

And you can find me in Rinos, up in the temper bill casino

Never was automatic 'cause I did it manual

"Collecting funds for the holy fight
Like a door to door salesman in the dead of night
Russian guns help him on his way
Bought with money from the USA

And the ordinary people say what's it for
And the ordinary people say we want no more
But the man at the top knows where to do the most harm
He's in he secret army
And this man with a gun says not a sound
I want this aeroplane turned around
He spent his life learning how to fill a man with lead
He'll probably spend the rest of it dead.

When a bomb goes off in a city street
When a man gets killed for his beliefs
When a mother cries for the son she had
That's when the world's gone mad

Tied with uncertainty and with lust

"It's the kind of grey November day that washes away reflections
In the eyes of hotel porters
And the latticed wooden benches by the sea contain no travellers
Or Irish lady authors
And the girl in the raincoat walks the lanes of Brighton
With her collar turned against the wind
And hovers in the doorways of second-hand bookshops
Among the dust and fading print
And you're not the one she's thinking of
And you're not the one she really wants
Just a point along the line she's leaving from
She goes into a cafe, orders tea, looks at the menu
But there's nothing really on it
And the place is as deserted as a plaza in a heat-wave
And the cloth has jam upon it
But the girl in the raincoat doesn't stop to count the tea-leaves
Or turn to see the mists around the sun
For the winter's unfolding around her
And it's time for moving on
And you're not the one she's thinking of
And you're not the one she really wants
Just a station on the line she's leaving from
And so you sit there in the middle of the carpet
With her suitcases around you
And it comes to you she journeyed to the center of your life
But she never really found you
Just another girl in a raincoat
Who shared the passing of the days
And you're glad of the warmth that she gave you
And you hardly need to say
That she's not the one you're thinking of
No she's not the one you really want
Just a point along the line you're leaving from",Rock

And I'll touch you from the world I wake in
Make the most of the present and the past

Flexin it, pokin it, strokin it, chokin
Cause you're feelin it, and I'm killin it
And like I said before I make you hit the ceiling bitch
Because hoes like you, you only come a dime a dozen

Oven hot pussy, yo she made me cum quick
Bouncin on my nuts like a pogo stick!

Knew I shouldn't have been messin' with dude's girl from start
But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin'
Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate
Friend or no friend, my man caught wind
This chick is payin' me, it'll either cost me or cost him
Told her she should f lost him  a while ago
Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo
I ain't here to start on this  for me to wreck his broad
You could tell what I thought of this 
Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was cause of cigarettes
 or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck
So I wasn't tryin' to call his bluff, by his persona
You could see, he think he tough!
If that wasn't enough, old girl had his son
This is Wild like the West I'm like Jesse on the run, uh
6 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? 
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gon' get through? 
Can't go left and  can't go right and 
Don't know, how we made it through the night 
5 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? 
I understand that time is runnin' out, I'm thinkin' of town-skippin'
Got a Chevy but the alternator be trippin'
I'm hittin' rum straight, thinkin' of a route to truncate
The streets is watchin', out is one way I put myself in his Nike's
His position is, ""Aight man, somebody bonin' my lady""
Probably snap like Rod-man
My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki 
'round four, when she was comin' she would beep me
I sat deep in the corner, drinkin' zombies, becomin' one by now
Wonderin' if my style would support her and her child
Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized 
One of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried
Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot
On some ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here""  like Deborah Cox
Looked at my watch,  I don't even got a watch
Felt for my glock, dammit I don't even got a glock, yo
4 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? 
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gon' get through? 
Can't go left and  can't go right and 
Don't know, how we made it through the night 
3 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? 
Pressure puh-pressure what? The pressure's cookin'
It ain't good lookin', like a black promoter I'm talkin' bookin'
Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whup him
But he was on the horn informin' the rest of them hoodlums 
Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine
Was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time
My pager went off, it read one line: ""Come get me
From Halsted,"" I'm thinkin' this is monkey bar 
Went to the phone quick, called her  Her line was busy
Situation number nine, got my mind dizzy
Wondered if this plan was designed to get me
I've been drinkin' too strong to be thinkin' too long
Like 40 goin' North I'm doin' 50, headed for the spot
Askin' God to be with me, and lately
She has been actin' shifty 
But then it hit me  it hit me 
It hit me  it hit me
2 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? 
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gonna get through? 
Can't go left and  can't go right and 
Don't know, how we made it through the night 
1 minute to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do?

Like a crack in a wall
Starting small, and grow in time
And we always seem to need the help

The ticking, and the western man's need to cry

They stay the same

Just give me time

With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems,
Louder than before
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names
Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost at the races too many times
She broke down the other day, yeah you know

The waitress then brought me up some coffee
I thanked her then called her back again
I said that old song sure does fit me cause I'm a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee for it is the best in the land
Put a nickel in the jukebox and play the Truck Drivin' Man

I climbed back aboard my old semi and then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a rolling now I'm on my way to San Antone

"Dear sir I write this note to you to tell you of my plight.
For at the time of writing it I'm not a pretty sight.
My body is all black & blue, my face a deathly grey.
And I write this note to say why I am not at work today.
While working on the 14th floor some bricks I had to clear.
But tossing them down from such a height was not a good idea.
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he is an awkward sod.
And he said I had to cart them down the ladders in me hod.
Well clearing all these bricks by hand, it was so very slow.
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below.
But in my haste to do the job, I was too blind to see.
That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me.
And so when I untied the rope the barrel fell like lead.
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead .
I shot up like a rocket and to my dismay I found.
That half way up I met the bloody barrel coming down.
The barrel broke my sholder as to the ground it sped.
And when I reached the top I banged the pulley with my head.
I clung on tightly numb with shock from this almighty blow.
While the barrel spilled out half its bricks some 14 floors below.
Now when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor.
I then out-weighed the barrel and so started down once more.
But I clung on tightly to the rope, my body racked with pain.
And half way down I met the barrel once again.
The force of this collision half way down the office block.
Caused multiple abbraisions and a nasty case of shock.
But I clung on tightly to the rope as I fell towards the ground.
And landed on the broken bricks the barrel had scattered round.
Well as I lay there on the floor I thought I'd passed the worst.
But the barrel hit the pulley wheel and then the bottom burst.
A shower of bricks rained down on me I didn't have a hope.
As I lay there bleeding on the ground I let go of the bloody rope.
The barrel now being heavier, it started down once more.
It landed right across me as I lay there on the floor.
It broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say.
I hope you understand why I am not at work today.",Folk

Hush then your sad repining God lives and all is well

No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight

Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

Worries and fears, I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight

"One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
Twas in the merry month of May, from me home I started,
Left the girls in Tuam, nearly broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblin;
Bought a pair of brogues, rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were by, saw I was a hobble in,
With a load ""Hurray !"" joined in the affray.
We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road

"So here we are now my friends,
Gathered together again,
To celebrate bittersweet life.
So here's to our struggles and strife.
Let's make the most of these hours,
Till time defeats all with its powers.
And lets make the most till the dawn,
Keep on going...until we are gone

One day there will come a time,
When we'll all face our crimes.
All the tears that we've caused,
To hide our fears and our flaws.
Getting so low and so high,
Caught between gutter and sky.
And we go through all of this...
Just for a small taste of...bliss.

Keep on going  / Until I'm gone 
So come on, come on  / Come on, come on
 / Keep on going  / Until I'm gone
 / So come on, come on 
Come on, come on 
Each of us breathing inside,
Each just along for the ride.
And each of us cursed to roam
We can never go home...
Nobody else understood,
But why just think they would?
And do you think its how we planned?
We're doing the best...the best that we can!

Keep on going  / Until I'm gone 
So come on, come on  / Come on, come on
 / Keep on going  / Until I'm gone

Trying not to think of all the ways, this place has changed
Walked around my neighbourhood
One hundred, one million, billion, trillion times
Every crack on the side-walk, below my feet
Green, black, and blue trash cans meet me after school
I just miss how it' felt standing next to you
Wearing matching dress before the world was big
I just miss how it' felt standing next to you
Wearing matching dresses before the world was big
My brain's like a rolling snowball, I'm a fire truck
Trying not to think of all the ways, my mind has changed
Mom and dad, I love you, do I show it enough?

"Check it on the one you Com is gonna come 
And check it out ha.

My raps do laps around tracks to the days
The idiot vibin' I'm the comma comma Chameleon
I use to pop the willy on my blue and gray sting ray
It had maxed I was with bitches that had coochie
Bassum wasn't rollin' Starters looking harder than niggas
Hoes wore clothes that exposed their figures
Ain't 7 steps in the jam, next the police come
Heist there would be one, numbers I would get at least one
We come to the get together with whatever
You wouldn't know how deep it was, we all did shit together
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew and then step to
The next cue, let's do it again y'all
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold
The days of Old Chicago and Fun Town and shorties we run round
Play strike outs till sun down, but the shit ain't as fun now
And the city is all run down, we troop down to Jew Town
Talking cat down on some gear, have enough for a Polish incom fair
I stare, at what use to be Bubbles and think about who use to cop our
Liquor
 Our neighborhood father figure

I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but ah,
""Niggas be rollin'"" Ol' Dirty Bastard from Protect Ya Neck
Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a hoe while I
""Niggas be rollin'""
Gotta make a stop take a leak and get some chops cause um
""Niggas be rollin'""
We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause um
""Niggas be rollin'""

I got more rhymes then the Manor got folks had style
Since I went to McDowl, wearin' boats
And penny loafers know I had the nickel in mines
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop
Skeeter will hit from the SAME spot
Torla tore my shit down, get down, put your body in motion
Only the strong survive, but on the 6 or the 5
Live as hot as sex use to be at the Racket
Wrong club with music by Andre Hatchet
Or either Beat Box Ferris at them country club parties
Would be hot as hell and house stud would get ""Find a body!""
Sawyers I would go there, hip hop clubs were so rare
I like the music anyways and it was always hoes there
Was said to have the best chicks but mostly High Park and V hoes
Is who I mess with, the best shit was troopin' to the loop
With your posisions held class crooked ass but still go the division
 Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work
Bust a smoothie on the spread, but sill have some on your shirt


I tuned into BMX and taped Farly on the tone master
I took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster
Then HBK was the only station that would fuck with rap
You was on the shore by yourself castin' stay up your act
What you could make of it, you was a gump they was takin' shit
Either fight or break for it, we go to the lake and get full
My drink there was Boons and Red Bull
I remember swimming in Avenlon, and being in a pool
I thought I was cool, with my ""members only"" and a bold fade
Wall to wall greens to get the sport gray and palmade
And soft breasts, as we got older we would star crush and bang fags
Go to Marshals and change tags, I snagged nuff niggas
And games are off the wall, in softball, Piggy one I would call
When I first got my three way callin', I caught Marsh tryin' to lie
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shot

"You got a lot to learn
You play in the fire
You might get burned
You gotta sacrifice
You're playin' the victim

You try to understand
The comb in the ashes

You're chasin' the visions
They're nowhere to find
Learn how to give
Learn how to take
Learn how to live
Before it's too late
You got the restless eyes
They turn to distraction
There's no compromise
You gotta take some time
And fight for the answers
They're hard to find
You now don'tcha fantasize
Start makin' your chances materialize
Learn how to bend, learn how to break
Learn how to mend broken heartaches
Learn to forgive, learn how to wait
Learn how to live before it's too late
Run from the light
And you lock all your doors
It's harder to fight

But they play out so wrong

With words you never spoke before
And will not speak again

Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly

Much more that life itself

It's you I need

I'm on the brink
You're on my mind

Away from me
Break me free

I'm in duress
Nevertheless
You're on my mind
Take me out
Dig me out of this hole
Break me out of prison
Before my parole
Scared for my health
With no where to hide
I'd rather be dead and
Start over with a fresh life
Take me out
Dig me out of this hole",Rock

"speak the truth don't you dare lie to me
I've seen it all before you disagree
the way you always attack all the things that you say
the way your turn your back and then you walk away
shut your mouth and open up your eyes
you better take your time and try to realize
that no one's free from sin and when I look at you
I scream within WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
you raise yourself up to a higher degree and look down in disgust at our misery
you're no better than your enemy
but it's easy to hate what you just can't be
don't deny the fact that you're a mortal man
you can't escape from death when it's close at hand
don't sit upon a pedestal and raise your voice
if you're to deaf to listen to the peoples

truth tell me the truh the truth motherfucker
tell me the truth tell me the truth tell me the truth
the truth you sucker
you play us out and you take us all for fools
but I never understood who even made the rules
I'll make my stand against supermacy
cos hypocritical goverments threaten me
I know you ain't blind and I know you're aware
but your ego's to big for you to even care
the doors are wide open but your eyes are closed
you're unable to look any further than your nose
you open your mouth and all I hear is lies
you keep spreading your message that I despite
because the game you're playing is so easy to see
it's just another repeat of our history
you talk about peace it's a very strong word
it's always being said but it's never been heard
hi-tec weapons are here to reasure it
but I've never seen a time when they've done a shit for it
Truth.....
kick it to me now cos I just can't figure
take a small mistake and make a small one bigger
equality's a word have you ever even heard it
I guess not and you don't deserve it

"The rap game, hip-hop 101
The hardest nine to five you'll ever have
You can't remember shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul? hahaha
The rap game will fuck you up
I'ma disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop ya ass
You'll neck'll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not realer, in fact you're feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, why'all presidents since we smacked
And got a mack 10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
'Cause you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac
I'ma get snuffed, 'cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down, when the White House just wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dike get sniped out
Lights out, bitch adios, goodnight  
Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute 'cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that seed to Laura, tell the slut to suck a dick
Motherfuck ducked, what the fuck? son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword of Cincy
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that utslay ipsbay
Upsay my ipnay, 'scuse my ickpay, addelay
But uckfay the rap game

This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you, know it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game
I wouldn't want to be drinkin', drowned in my own inequity
But fucked that I'ma rap 'til why'all all get sick of me
And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
I'm pickin' a rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playin'
If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived to this wise, speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand?
OK, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no shorts 'cause I'm mean  say this is whack
I walk in that party and just start bussin' 
Right after I hear the last verse of ""Self Destruction""
This liquor makes me want to blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Dangerome 
I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
Ya feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable, I party anatic
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a 'matic
Coughin' the static, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Poppin' the tablet and guns to soften 

I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, we street niggas twistin' the words
We finally could ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood""
'cause Proof and Shyne man shit nothin' in common
But ask this band with gasoline chan
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse, fuck ya stature dog
Nothin' to do with hands when I clap at why'all
But to draw on the ground with the form and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter of fact, we can battle for plaques 
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Lorraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument, who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin' 20 below, forced to join 
My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
That's why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks

A molten liquid of penance splashed my eyes
Unseen truth, a divine surgery
Reveals view, windows of faith

Guiding cue, calmness in a mental lake

In pools of divine nectar

Shall be drained by holes of wisdom

Share it with me, baby

Side by side I hope that we'll always be

Still she looks
Saying come back to me
He tells her just remember me this way
Fore here am I more true

We're all alone here on this beach again

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

That nobody else had to die

With a terrible wound in his side

And I wondered how long she would stay
I needed so much to have nothing to touch
I've always been greedy that way

Crying, Papa, you promised to play
And they lead me away to the great surprise
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes
And they hide, they hide in the world

Saying when will she summon me, when will she come to me
What must I do to prepare?

"So you came from New York city
And you want to see the sights
You've heard all about those cowboys
And their crazy Texas nights
I see you've got your eye on something
Leaning on the bar
But the toughest ride he's ever had
Was in his foreign car
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and them fancy boots
Don't tell you what's inside, no
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
He was a Hollywood idea
Of the wild and wooly west
In his French designer blue jeans
And his custom tailored vest
You're thinkin' he's the real thing
But I think you oughta know
He can't even make it through
A one night rodeo, no
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and them fancy boots
Don't tell you what's inside, no
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied

"The last glance at your door is killing me slow
Like a final sign of time
And these handcuffs can't tie me to this world
No answers can be given anymore
And so the winter came when we waited for the sun
It's the icy breath of a flower
In isolation I cry, but no tears leaves my eye
And the walls will crush me again
A child screams - innocent and silent in this night
Far away...
Glass is breaking with a noise
Louder than I ever heard before
Let me out
All that we wanted was eternity
Didn't care for the price we would pay
But now you're alone, I don't know where
And I ask you how long must I stay
Let me out!",Rock

What are the words of my tongue?
What are these thoughts of my mind?
What have I become?
His kingdom doesn't reach these heights
His power has come to an end
I will go wherever you are
Cause you are my dear, my child
You have become
Blinded, darkened, numb,
The torturer of your soul
The punisher of your life
The self hate that keeps you to the fire
The blame that heavily weighs on your shoulders
The confusion bewildering your wish
You are pity, a rag, a leaf in a storm
His kingdom doesn't reach these heights
His power has come to an end
I will go wherever you are
Cause you are my dear, my child
You've got an insatiable
Hunger for destruction
A constantly desire for pain
You are drawn to the dark
As a moth to the light
Chains around your neck
They are tightening
So you just keep on fighting
His kingdom doesn't reach these heights
His power has come to an end
I will go wherever you are
Cause you are my dear, my child
The sickening thoughts
Are kept outside
Now I can breathe
There is no need to hide",Metal
"Life can feel like a red light screaming ""Go!""
And everyday means an answer I don't know.
This world can make you wanna fake it
And nobody wants to face it alone.
Its hard to shake that feeling that your hearts not home.

Trying to hope,
Trying to love,
Trying to cope,
Life's a war that few of us survive.
And I'm just trying to make it out alive.
Everyone has a story to be told,
And every tongue has a lie it could expose.
This world describes all the treatments,
To keep all the secrets you want,
We've learned how to think,
Without our minds turned on.

Trying to hope,
Trying to love,
Trying to cope,
Life's a war that few of us survive.
And I'm just trying to make it out alive.
The pain we go through is what makes us who we are.
And if we hold each other through,
The deepest darkest parts...
Then we can live,
Then we can hope,
Then we can love,
Then we can cope,
Life is not a jump it is a head first dive!

Disagree on the sidelines.
Fight for a fee, the man needs a maid.
The maid needs a maid.
Bros before hos is a rule, read the guidelines

Your breasts heave when you sing
Your mouth should be working for me for free.
Sewing up the fold 'cause I've been laid up,
Will you put on the fire for me,
Draw the bath and remind me to eat?

You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you,
You could be a good wife to me.

"There is something I must tell you
Never before has it been like this
We could talk all day about nothing
I bet it would seem like heaven's bliss
There's an energy in the air
Zero to the top whenever you appear
If I'm wrong just call me crazy it's alright
I can't believe it feels so strong
I can't believe I wrote a song
So can I put it on the table would you give me the time
Can let I you know the meaning of the looks on the side
Could you do me just a favor could you ease my mind
Could you tell me it's a mutual fire cause
As the world turns I dream in colour
It's love, life, you and me and all we could discover
As the world turns you have to understand
We've got chemistry
Chemistry
Magic feels like magic 
The way this all came to be
Started out like oil and water
Then I got caught up
I can't even get a hold of me
It's a mystery in design
Not even the dictionary could define
But they tell me truth lies in the eyes
And those eyes tell me no lies
So can I tweet it on my twitter let the followers know
Show the people our super hyper magnetic flow
Or we can keep it undercover like a midnight glow
Either way I'm ready to go cause
As the world turns I dream in colour
It's love, life, you and me and all we could discover
As the world turns you have to understand
We've got chemistry

I've got a leg over there, I've got my ass somewhere upside down
But I'm back, I'm here to tell you, I'm back, better than before

Thought that I was standing tall, turned out I was the ball

The roses are in bloom
But in a strange way
I know somehow we're doomed
Look around through the town
Not a soul to be found
In silence, not a sound
There's no one around but you
In the back of the car
On our way from the bar
In silence, here we are
Reminding us we're doomed
We'll get sad it's time we've come to the end
We've circled around our doom
And I won't stop, not till I get what I want
And all that I want is you
In a strange place
When the sun goes down, we move
Into a strange phase
Like we've got nothing left to lose
So we slip through the town
With our heads in the clouds
In silence, not a sound
For miles and miles around
Fall asleep in the park
Underneath all the stars
In silence, here we are
Reminded of how we're doomed
Get sad it's time we've come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop, not till I get what I want
And all that I want is you
It's you
All that I want is you
Yeah, you
All that I want is you
So get sad it's we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop, not till I get what I want

"Our story beings on a Sunday afternoon, just between Halfway Tree and Spanish Town, where a young boy, not yet the cock o'the walk that he would soon become, was lying on the grass and taking in the sweet and sensuous scent of Hibiscus that languidly lilted along the summer breeze. It was at this precise moment that he saw her. Her walk was soft and delicate, with a thaumaturgical touch that only a rabbiÃÂ¯ Â¿ Â½s daughter could have. Before their eyes had even met, her luminous lips had already lured him in. Salvation winked with the promise of a Bris held at pinnacle and a congregation of sage's bunny hopping and chicken dancing to Yiddish Mento. Then their eyes linked, an aeon blinked, Amharic vows were scryed upon their hearts. Just to think, this could be with the frenectomy and a few words of love...
My Shabop Shalom Baby, won't you Shabop Shalom with me, under the old banana tree?
My sweet telavivian lambs bread, my heart can act as an emollient and you'll never, ever say, ""Get Bent!"" Noooo, no, no!

They want your position, they tryin to scoot you up out of it
Take your foot of the gas, I thought we had an arrangement

Speelt het blikken harmonieorkest in een grote regenton
Daar trekt over de heuvels en door het grote bos
De lange stoet de bergen in van het circus Jeroen Bosch
En we praten en we zingen en we lachen allemaal
Want daar achter de hoge bergen ligt het land

Ik loop gearmd met een kater voorop
Daarachter twee konijnen met een trechter op hun kop
En dan de grote snoeshaan, die legt een glazen ei
Wanneer je 't schudt dan sneeuwt 't op de Egmondse abdij
Ik reik een meisje mijn koperen hand
Dan komen er twee Moren met hun slepen in de hand
Dan blaast er de fanfare ter ere van de schaar
Die trouwt met de vingerhoed ze houden van elkaar

Speelt nog steeds het harmonieorkest in een grote regenton

"Hey yo man, remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! 
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit",Hip-Hop

"As the pages burn
Secrets can't be unlearned
Silence can't be unheard... Knowledge is burden
Power is onus as the pages burn
Rejecting cognition as the pages turn
Sinking in a pool of either
The past is washed clean
Rip apart the world
Word by word
Inch by inch
Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience
Sweet amnesia here to free you
As the pages burn 
All you trials solved bye fire
As the pages burn
As smoke fills the room soon to pass... heavy gloom
The wind will whisk away the past
A blank page stares at you
Nothing left
Where to start?
A second chance carries expectation!
The books you'd written no longer exist
The future is in your pen
Ink to paper now begin
Rip apart the world
Word by word
Inch by inch
Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience!
Sweet amnesia here to free you
As the pages burn 
All you trials solved bye fire
As the pages... burn!
Rewriting history
Starting now!
Erase the misery
Let the flames eat your doubts
Sweet amnesia here to free you
As the pages burn 
All you trials solved bye fire

Ooooooh, set the controls for the heart of the pelvis
Haven't you heard my name rhymes with Elvis
And one thing I know is this
That your mouth is telling me to give you a big kiss


Ahhh, can't you see what's on offer
Yeah babe it's going cheap today
I enter a room and all the girls say
C'mon Jarv, can I be the first?
Oh you make us so hot we feel we're gonna burst

So please, so please
Don't leave me alone in this double bed
It smells of damp towels and asthma inhalers
Say you're gonna call back later
Save me from these glossy photographs
Save me from my mother's laugh

Slowly time is passing somehow I get bye
Keeping myself busy
Is my sole occupation
I don't know
What I'm doing
But it fills my mind
Putting off the moment
When I can't escape you baby.
Alone in the night
Me and the memory
Somebody set me free
From someone who used to be.
A part of my night
Woman please let me go
You said godbye
Now here I lie
Alone in the night.
It's lucky I got lovin' friends who come around
Eatin' drinkin' talkin'
About anything out you love
Late night shows in T. V.
When they've all gone home
And then I gotta face it I am dyin' for you baby.
Alone in the Night ...
Lonely days are bad enough but come the night
My heart and I can't fight it
We remember come back we surrender.

Forsaking all others till death do us part
Wherever you go I'll follow and whatever you do I want to be part of it
Because you're so much a part of me that I just couldn't live without you
Forsaking all others for better or worse I don't even have to think about it
Because no matter how rough it gets along the way
Every step that I take with you is over a mountain of happiness
Or through a valley of golden sunshine
For richer or poorer I'll never be poor as long as I own your love
Because it's the most priceless possession that I have
You made me the richest girl in the world when you gave your heart to me

Recall the time we were so close
I hold on to your light to be together
With you once again
Since the day I was born, you took my hands
And helped me to survive
Everyday we've lived you gave me your love
And taught me to be sweet and strong

The sport of dukes...Earls...Bos...Johns...anything that
Looks good when it's embroidered on a polyester shirt.
And you know, bowling takes on this almost religious
Significance because it's so much like a religion.
I mean the ball is round, like the earth, and it's got
The holy trinity: the Father, the Son, and the..
Thumbhole. And as you roll the ball down the alley of
Life...Striking out the pagan religions of the past...
Sparing them the anguish of their lives in the gutter...
Framing their existence in an eternal metaphysicalness
Something like a 7-10 split!

We'll be bowling in Hickton 
We'll be bowling in Gander

We'll be bowling Vancouver, bowling Saskatoon

Some other words they left somewhere behind

One and one and one is three

Armor-clad forces, riding Trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didn't want to be a part of the great debate on moonshine
Chorus:
""Stop, pay the price,"" they said to me
""Take this advice, you're out of your head""
I said, ""Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red""
Sly man stumbles, twists and he tumbles
He always lands on his feet
And he sets his face towards the far horizon
Won't you come this way? Can't you go that way?
But his rhythm don't miss a beat
'Cause he's doing everything he can to keep surviving
""Stop, pay the price,"" they said to me
""Take this advice, you're out of your head""

I'll listen with greedy ears
If you teach me how
to close my eyes
I'll keep my conscience clear
Is there a purpose left to find
by accident or by design
It doesn't matter if your eyes are open when your mind is blind
Trapped under ice
trapped by your hollow lies
I sense my sun wont shine much longer
but you will pay the price
you will pay the price
how could we ever forget
what we have already learned
with all the bridges we
burned
review the consequence and think beyond only you and I
Figure out the purpose - your deed is a crime
there's another way
another ending to our tale
real eyes realize real lies
don't succumb to the paraphrase
If you speak with a golden tongue
I'll listen with greedy ears
If you teach me how
to close my eyes
I'll keep my conscience clear
must be another way
this time we must be brave
real eyes realize real lies
real eyes realize real lies
So listen up and listen close
This is not the path I chose
So listen up and listen close

Bitch ain't shit, free
I ain't them niggas, they ain't me
We just don't do it the same
It ain't the gang then we don't ride to it
I got to ride to the crib
Getting high, we both roll our own
Grab the vape, hit the bong
Teach you how to stuff a cone
A boss bitch, I do this on my own
Three cellular phones
A bad bitch, naw she ain't regular
Ain't the game nigga, you a competitor
I get to this bread instead of trying to chill
Or kick it with lame niggas
They only around you cause you famous
But me I'm the king of the underground
Getting with with my brothers
If I ain't with my son then I'm burning one

Who know the city better than me huh?
Who get the pussy wetter than me huh?
What it is, what's it gonna be?
As long as you know I get 'em gone by the morning
I put you in perfect situations so you can just be you
Nothing awkward or uncomfyy like them other niggas do
I like them party girls, so keep them tough old broads
Cause I'm a gentleman, sometimes I don't fuck hard
I'm dissing funky hoes, the ones you gotta impress
Then audition those in a bra and a dress
If what I'm saying is embarrassing to you, then blush bitch
Fuck taking your time, you better rush

Understand you got chosen by a real one
Big dick boss to take care of all these little ones
Got it out the mud, stay cleaner than my Nikes
And no, I'm not alone, I came with twenty just like me
Baby I'm a dog, don't like me
Way too hyphy, just one night me
Give it to you nightly, your  will wanna fight me
Then I gotta beat him up, after that I beat it up
Roll a fat J and watch the homegirl eat it up
Like a parfait, I know you wanna leave with us
Hey, I'm in love with myself
One kiss from the , will have you cumming on yourself, bitch

A skilled street nigga then I hop on the beat
Is this your man rolling weed in my passenger seat?
I know Quik got a hit when he sample a beat
To make the first nigga with a platinum plaque from the beach
I'm back in the streets, trapping on the phone with a freak
Tell a hoe to sell her soul to spend a moment with me
It's gotta be smooth, out the rover turn the zone to a key
Spent my life on the grind for y'all to notice it's me

Referred to as a walking thief,

Why the fuck they blamin' him,
He's the one that they jock.
Keepin' niggaz in line,
Whoever fucks with his rhyme,
And before you fuck with him,
You gotta fuck with his nine.
Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga,
He could whoop his ass cause he's bigger.
Size don't mean shit,
He's from the old school fool,
He's a villain from the streets,
And he's supposed to rule,
Not sayin' he's in shit,
But he's down for mine,
He was put on the streets to keep niggaz in line.
Never givin' a fuck,

Because I know that he's a nigga that you want to be.
He can't help it he's in shit,
But he don't hold shit back,
He's a gangsta in black,
And he's about to attack.

Cause I'm a ruthless villain,
Cold tearin' shit up,
Don't come on my face,
Pumpin' no kind of junk,
Eazy-E's in control,
And if you press your luck,
I'll smoke you like that,

He don't give a fuck,
It's Eazy-E in the crowd,
But he's not in the 4,
I tell his money flow,
As he collects from his ho',
All expenses paid,
For the rhymes that he made,
Got the trophys in the house,
For the girls that he laid.
Not a wimp he's a pimp,
Now of course he's the boss,
So keep your bitch out his face,
Or else she's gonna get tossed.

The boy got heart,
Wanna fuck with him,
He'll Rip your head apart.

That's what they yellin'
But him with his gangsta stroll,
He keeps bailin'.
Wherever he goes,
There's no discussion but silence.
They say that he's the one,

"Screaming chasm into these emptied voids
Senses aroused by the undoing of creation
Weapons of these vengeful arrangements
To coincide with this mass fall of imperium
Immense columns holding up the heavens
Collapsing from the might of the choirs below
Burrowing hallucination from the infested carrion
In this apocalypse for the millennium of the sun
Visualize the final stance of promise as blood pours out of the stars
A decay that serves as the portal into the gates of the great ancients
Tides of this distinct neglect awaken those who left behind the pride of liberation

And when the morning came do you remember if she cried a tear or two
Is the homesteam still on fire do they still win all their games
And by the way did she mention my name

Is the landlord still a loser do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame

I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon' do it gourmet
I'm hearing fuckin' voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds off for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frÃ­o
That's Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I'm gambling with watches getting better with time
So I'mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say ""time is money"", forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display
 Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin'
Champagne poppin', bad thing poppin'
Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin'

Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day
Bars in alignment, stars in alignment
Raw off consignment, God's in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that's behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I've seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I'm a rare diamond that's hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 To 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain't no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me diamond
Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I'm rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin' that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say ""I need that fadeaway""
Had a crush on what's her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can't take his chain away
Real play you can't take his game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can't take my dame away, devil in a red dress
But she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that's my favorite compilation

Standing out in front of Wilson's five and dime
Staring through the window at the jewelry
Hungry for the things you couldn't buy
Just like a fool I thought that I could please you
I saw you had an eye for things that shine
I paid seven saw mill dollars for a bracelet
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.
The cabin that I built in West Virginia
Was not enough to keep you satisfied
'Cause a man that's got a saw mill occupation
Can't afford to feed a rich girls' appetite
I wonder if you're still with Willie Jackson
Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive
Ol' Willie he gave up his wife and children
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

"Ein paar Minuten, Schlendrians Geschichte ist schnell erzählt,
der Zeit in Rauch aufgehen läßt und in der Schule fehlt.
Schlurfender Schritt, verschlafener Blick,bei der süßen Nachbarin kein Glück.
Mutter kann nicht mehr und alle halten ihn für verrückt.
Nicht viel los bei ihm, außer ein heftiger Loop vielleicht
und er kennt sich gut damit aus wie man ein lässigen Rap dazu schreibt.
So sitzt er Nacht für Nacht mit Zettel und Stift,
alleine in seinem Keller und bastelt Bomben nur für sich.
Wie besessen, er vergißt zu essen und draußen weiß niemand von nichts.
Aber Schlendrian fährt mit dem Mond und führt die Sonne hinters Licht.
Der Spinner hat sich nicht mehr beisammen, sagen die Leute,
aber Schlendrian träumt weiter insgeheim seine Super Star Träume.
Super Star Träumer
Er ist ein Super Star Träumer
Das Ding ist, die Zukunft kommt immer anders als du glaubst,
und so nimmt auch dieses mal alles seinen etwas anderen Verlauf.
Es ist noch zu früh am Morgen, zu früh für irgendwas,
da klopft es an der Tür und jemand ruft: ""Ey, ey Schlendrian,
bist du schon wach ?""
Wer verdammt ist das? Schlendrian schlurft zur Tür um nachzusehen
und er staunt nicht schlecht als da der Zeitgeist vor ihm steht.
Mit seinem langen, weißen Bart sieht er aus wie dieser gallische Druide.
""Ich habe großes mit Dir vor"" sagt er und verzieht dabei keine Miene.
""Komm mit mir, ich weiß von deinem Talent
und ich schwöre, daß im nächsten Jahr jeder deine Raps auswendig kennt.""
Schlendrian denkt, was habe ich zu verlieren, das ist doch wunderbar,
werden meine Super Star Träume am Ende doch noch wahr.
Und bald zeigt sich, der Geist hat nicht zu viel versprochen,
schon nach wenigen Wochen ist das Eis gebrochen,
Konzerthallen kochen, die Nation im Schlendrian-Fieber,
Groupies stehen in Schlangen an und nicht nur für seine Lieder,
in jedem Kinderzimmer, über dem Sofa, sein Gesicht auf Poster,
Nase voll mit Koka, nächtelang nichts als Vodka, Senora und Poker.
Der Typ hat was du willst, sagen die Leute.
Es kann so kommen und hier kommen Schlendrian
und seine Super Star Träume.
In einer Hand hält er die Welt, mit der anderen zählt er sein Geld.
Du solltest nochmal überlegen bevor du dich gegen ihn stellst.
Schlendrian ist der Held und so derbe V.I.P.
Champagner, Leder und Rolex, Krokoleder und Jet Setsex
Katzer hassen ihn, weil ihn die Kätzinnen lieben,
du kannst noch so viele Sechsen werfen, er wirft immer die Sieben.
Mindestens aber dann plötzlich wendet sich das Blatt,
als ihm der Zeitgeist wieder erscheint und folgendes zu sagen hat:
""Es ahnt noch niemand aber irgendwo da draußen gibt es die Crew
Doppelkopf und wenn die landen, landen sie den großen Coup.
Ich muß sie finden, ihre Zukunft wird golden sein,
unser Wege trennen sich hier, tut mir leid aber deine Zeit ist vorbei"".
Schlendrian sucht den Scherz darin, aber findet nur bittersten Ernst darin
und für ihn geht es abwärts wie für ein Blatt im Herbstwind,
Im Sturzflug haben wir ja immer gewußt, sagen die Leute.
Das ist das Ende für Schlendrian und seine Super Star Träume.",Hip-Hop
"Your signal across the sky,
Is trying to bridge the distance,
And all of the reasons why,
I'm so far away,
I know you can move the time,
And the space that falls between us,
I know you can cross the lines,
All I can say is,
Break them down

You are what's turning my world around,
Moving me close in the moment with a single motion,
Even when all of my stars are falling,
You pulled me from here to you
It feels like I'm falling down,
Through atmospheres and orbits,
And I'm moving without a sound,
I'm floating away,
But you are the satellite,
That makes the strong connection,
With messages through the night,
When the going is insane,
Send them down,
Cause they're keeping me alive,
Send them down

A million miles away,
Is as close as a razor,
All the words I can't say,
In a breath of silence,
All the truth I'm looking for,
Is just beyond my shadow,
When I'm spinning in the night
You are what's turning my world around...

be in Tijuana by the crack of dawn.
If we rob the

we could pawn his pawn his modern art and make a fortune.
If we rob the lonely widow

and buy a cottage by the ocean.
If we swim to Junk Island we'll burn up like the seagulls

Yo, go and flow for the mack and be the hoe
So grow cause the lynchin brothers might get hung
Better rip through em from the tip of my mouth/Mao, say/Tse-Tung/tongue
Deficit  catch the glint

And I dissent, as I clench and raise my fist
 so you could get with this
Here's a twist cause we'll overthrow like Kwame N'Krumah
Spread around the wealth as if it were a, vicious rumor

From four hundred years of exploitation
Anesthesia provided by your local TV station
Patience is not a virtue 
Turn this shit over like Bush did a boatload of Haitians

Clown downtown tried to put us in the dog pound
Like H. Rap Brown with the situation
 cause I'm spittin dialectical analysis
So how is this, we never had no Funk
Until you found out that I turned to revolutionary hunk
 Bump you over like dominoes, rat

Lyrics hear it fear it can't get near it
Got a sample didn't clear it
Point Blank says, ""Fuck five-oh!"" That's the spirit
Cheer it, spat out, the fat that I consumed
Knew that I was doomed since my date of birth
To be the wretched of the earth, never had a Dream that was American

Whoever paved that shit got minimum wage too!

From yelling, ""Oh shit!"" when five-oh comes to harass me
They never pass me, no one to go and tail bro

Leaders they killed, if I said it, it would threaten em
They only see my back because I'm three steps ahead of em

"There are many faces of death
But none as horrific as the irrational slaying of innocent infants
The committing of infanticide
New born innocent victim
Killed by Mother's infliction
Psychotropic sickness

Severe mental psychosis

Blood that's frozen frigid
A heart of hardened ice
A breath of death to warm her
As she makes the sacrifice
Infanticide

Post Partum depression
The dying child's convulsion
Vicious act of madness
Emotional breakdown and sadness
Cold and callous
Mean and malice
Sad but true
Nothing you can do
Death desire that can't be tamed
Overflow her brain
For this death she's not to blame
You know that she's insane
Psychoactive chemicals affecting all perception
Termination elimination the removal of all conception
From the womb to the grave
How can we conceive
Trauma stricken mother
Sits crying in disbelief
Hormonal dysfunction
The innocent child's destruction
Born to die
Weeping mothers cry
Nothing but waste
Consequences faced
Cold and callous
Mean and malice
Sad but true

Calling me from Miami, my Amy
What took you so long, I thought you'd never call?

"Dear Diary
Mood: Apathetic
My life is spiraling downward
I couldn't get enough money to go to the Blood Red Romance and Suffocate Me Dry concert
It sucks cause they play some of my favorite songs like Stab My Heart Because I Love You and Rip Apart My Soul and of course Stabby Rip Stab Stab and It doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to do that flippy thing either,
Like that guy from that band can do...Some days...
I'm an emo kid, non-conforming as can be.
You'd be non-conforming too if you looked just like me
I have paint on my nails and makeup on my face
I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs
Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag
I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag
'Cause our dudes look like chicks, and our chicks look like dykes
Cause emo is one step below transvestite
Stop my breathing and slit my throat
I must be emo
I don't jump around when I go to shows
I must be emo
I'm dark and sensitive with low self esteem
The way I dress makes everyday feel like Halloween
I have no real problems but I like to make believe
I stole my sisters mascara now I'm grounded for a week
Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies
I cant get through a hawthorne heights album without sobbing
Girls keep breaking up with me, it's never any fun
They say they already have a pussy, they don't need another one.
Stop my breathing and slit my throat
I must be emo
I don't jump around when I go to shows
I must be emo
Dye in my hair and polish on my toes
I must be emo
I play guitar and write suicide notes
I must be emo
My life is just a black abyss... ya know..its so dark. And its suffocating me, grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip, tighter than a pair of my little sisters jeans...which look great on me by the way.
When I get depressed I cut my wrist in every direction
Hearing songs about getting dumped gives me an erection
I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses
I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes
Im just a bad, cheap imitation of goth
You can read me Catcher in the Rye and watch me jack off
I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life
If I said I like girls, I'd only be half right.
I look like I'm dead and dress like a homo
I must be emo
Screw X-box I play old school Nintendo
I must be emo
I like to whine and hate my parentals
I must be emo
Me and my friends all look like clones
I must be emo
My parents don't get me, ya know
They think I'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy...well, a couple guys. But, I mean, it's the 2000s. Cant 2...or 4 dudes make out with each other without being gay?
I mean, chicks dig that kind of thing anyways.

For the days are short and cold and work is scarce

But tell me where the fuck you find that anorexic rapper
Talkin' about who you go squabble with and who you shoot
You're only 60 pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots

Damn E they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only make Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is a G-Thang
But on his old album covers he was a she thang.
So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to these

Every day it's a new rapper
Claimin' to be deffer than the Dresta
Smoother than a bitch, but betray the role of gangster
Ain't broke a law in your life, yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knives, just take a good look at the Nigga
And you'll capture the fact that
the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have ya ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim ya used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness to ya fuckin' work
See ya never had no business so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangsters
See I did dirt but put in work and many niggas can vouch that
So since I've got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of so many niggas
Claiming that they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets G
Think ya started trying to bang a rap
While ya tryin' to sign a peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mime while you rhyme
Little fag try to sag, but ya floodin' at the same time
And ya set don't accept ya, Scared to kick it with your homies
Cause ya know they don't respect ya
So nigga please check nuts before you step to these

Well, It's the Knock out, definition original baby gangsta
approach me like you hard muthafucka
I'm a bank ya, shank ya with my fuckin' shank if I hafta

Pranksters, studio gangsters, busters
but this time you're dealing with some real muthafuckas
jeez, nigga please, don't try to step cause if you do
Then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you of something
Claiming my city but Dre you ain't from Compton
Niggas like ya'll is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to Real Muthaphuckkin G's

I never met an OG who never did shit wrong
Ya tried to diss the Eazy-E so now nigga it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that you're hogging shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit
But then again some niggas think it makes a man. . . Damn
It's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearing lipstick to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now ya think your bigger, but to me you ain't nothin'
but a bitch ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions

Unless I'm left field or Dizzy Wright right after
Living a life that you niggas obsessed with
Telling my story, this is just another chapter
What you make of a young man working faithfully
Real is something that these niggas can't take from me
Call it what you want, but I know what it is
But you better watch what you say to me
Play no games 'specially if you not family
I wanna live in a country that's pot friendly
One love and positive vibrations
Blessed with a mind that take me to wild places
Give that to y'all
Let y'all run with it
Come get it, if you're down feed off that
Not involved with a lot of things that take me off track
But if you love it then I need your back
Talk to 'em
I don't know how y'all feel about me
But can you feel the good vibes  Can you feel the good vibes

Told he was a tramp
He stood at the bar and he called a pint, then turned
And gazed at the fire
On a night like this, to be save and dry is my one and
Only desire
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
Then in a voice that was hushed and low he said
""Listen, I'll tell you a tale""
How a man of the sea became a man of the road and never
More will set sail
I fished out of Howth and Killybegs, Ardglass and
Baltimore
But the cruel sea has beat'n me and I'll end my days on
The shore
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
One fateful night in the wind and the rain we set sail
From Killybegs town
There were five of us from sweet Donegal and one from
County Down
We were fishermen who worked the sea and never counted
The cost
But I never thought 'ere that night was done, that my
Fine friends would all be lost
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
Then the storm it broke and drove the boat, to the
Rocks about ten miles from shore
As we fought the tide, we hoped inside to see our homes
Once more
Then we struck a rock and holed the bow and all of us
Knew that she'd go down
So we jumped right into the icy sea and prayed to God
We wouldn't drown
But the ragin' sea was risin' still as we struck out
For the land
And she fought with all her cruelty to claim that
Gallant band
By Saint John's point in the early dawn I dragged
Myself on the shore
And I cursed the sea for what she'd done and vowed to
Sail her never more
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
Ever since that night I've been on the road, travelin'
And tryin' to forget
That awful night I lost all my friends, I see their
Faces yet
And often at night when the sea is high and the rain is
Tearing at my skin
I hear the cries of drowning men, floating over on the
Wind
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'

"Players we ain't the same
I'm into 'Caine and guns
Show par with the fishes
Make the face lift numb
Out in Panama
In that amazin' sun
I'm amazin' son
You niggas wonder
Where my grace is from
I speak with corrupted tongue
Recognized the underworld
Since I was young
Back in '84 when I saw
Crocket and Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big
When they televised that raw
My Mama should've seen it comin'
Me runnin' up and down
The stairs too quick
Hummin' Miami Vice theme music
Call the 'roin made me colder
I see the villains' impact
Now that I'm older
Ignorant fool
Views ignorant, too
Got a lot of money
Keep militant tools
Wasn't present the session
They handed out the rules
So I grab a tape
It related to life's trues
The meanin'?
Pusha T's more than you're seemin'
Not just a rap name
More so like a damn shame
Nothin's changed
Just the crimes is less heinous
The three of us know
Yet the shooter remains nameless
And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap
And I ain't lost my past
Shit could get hairy
I could lose myself in a flash
Niggas will think I'm Jim Carrey
How I off that Mask
I even went by the book at first
Until I realized nine to five
Wouldn't quench my thirst, so I
Start my mission
Leave my residence
Mama knew that a child like me
Had better sense
But somethin' had to give
That's real, I had to live
I chefed that soft white
And pumped from her crib
Scouts honor started with my grandmama
Who distributed Yay
She had flown in from the Bahamas
Partner, please, I grinds
I hustle with ease
Can damn near eyeball
Any weight in my sleep
I don't entertain hate
Surroundin' the street
If I was you
I'd be tryin' to get down with me
But no, see these niggas know too much
Meanwhile I rock jewels
That look like my diamonds blush
Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak
Many times back to back
And still feel belittled
Sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown ass rappers
Who tend to give me the giggles
Let 'em take it
However they wanna take it
I'm the reason your favorite MC's
No longer your favorite
Hey, I'm one of the greats
I can't lie
I mean great to the point
I'm concerned I might die
Make no mistake
Malice is who you tune to
It's all in the name
Trust, I will wound you",Hip-Hop
"Three minutes my nigga, y'all know what it is
JUST BLAZE!

Gangsta gangsta, that's already evident
Nigga Witta Attitude, check check my residence
Whether I'm Crip or Blood, homey that's irrelevant
I with the D.O.C., there's nobody better than
The West coast felon when he on that lowrider bike pedallin
Somebody tell Eazy they still yellin it
I'm wit'cha homey Doc Dre on the television
While these niggas movin peanuts like a elephant
I move cars like spinnin rims
I'm in a class all by myself like the brown Eminem
Not to down Eminem, I fuck black bitches
Fuck white bitches, nigga I like bitches
Them half-and-half Alicia Keys dyke bitches
If the head right I might Air Nike bitches
Or put 'em on the track like Just Blaze
I look down on hoes and look up to Dre
Cause ain't 
Gangsta, gangsta! 


 
I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tee and Ren rolled in one
Used to move birdies 'til I put a hole in one
Nigga that thought I wasn't holdin a gun
And tried to ride up on me like Afeni Shakur's only son
Dre told me he ain't doin Detox, this his only run
Mase comin back, and Hov, he done
I'm surrounded by legends, sittin at the round table
I am The Game, and still niggas tryin to play dude
I'm ruthless, I ain't talkin 'bout the label
I'll hook niggas up, and I don't mean free cable
I mean I'll hook niggas up to them IV's
The same way Dre hooked me up to Iovine
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Heller me
Tell Dre put up a mill, cause that's what my bail'll be
Gangsta, gangsta! 



I've been rappin for one year, one month, 17 days
13 hours, 28 minutes, then I met Dre
30 minutes after I bought the new Em
That was November 18th, 3:09 PM
Around the same time, ""Wanksta"" got it's first spin
That was 32 weeks before they signed Rakim
Eight months, 13 days before I knew where Mike lived
And three years after Mason Betha turned his mic in
I started writin 22 months and 20 weeks prior
To LeBron shakin Adidas for Nikes
I'm right here, six years after Randy Moss
Caught his first touchdown for them Vikings
Just one day, seven hours, 14 minutes
21 seconds before SoundScan got printed
Two platinum records 'fore I'm classified with Biggie
And two seconds before the song finish, yeah",Hip-Hop

Oh where are you my lovely Johnny?
I'm afraid and all alone
There is no peace for me
I'm sitting in the stranger's room
Playing at the stranger's table
Shining empty like the moon

But in the darkness struggle cold
I think about a garden valley
Gentle as the leaves unfold
Singing out across the bay
Distant and so far away
There is no peace for me
I'm blinded by your city lights
I wander through these fearful places
The colours fade to black and white
There is no peace for me
And these are not the friends I know
These are not their smiling faces
A desert that no-one should know
There is no peace for me

Now I know and feel it well
Poor immigrants deep sunken feeling
Standing at the gates of Hell
There is no peace for me
Burned out by their master's greed
Cruel exile transportation
Robbed of every love and need
There is no peace for me

You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes
You can be good and sure
The day belongs to us

So I did
And I found myself in a wonderful place
Fields of green
When the wind blows cold
The kind of place one could grow old
Sky opened up 
Sun showered down 
Onto a row of wooden pikes
What an awe inspiring sight
Birds shy on top of them
Puts your head in a beautiful state
You'll get yours when you're good and ready
You'll get yours and go straight to hell
And when that day comes
You can be good and sure
The day belongs to us

I answer back: ""You watch your mouth!""

You and stories have grown old

SOS who gives a shit?
Sinking like a rock with a heart of coal
Sinking like a rock without a soul
Please note, don't underestimate
Cause I'm a cruel motherfucker!

You'll get yours and go straight to hell

Soon with you, it's gonna blow
In your car for hours and days
Weeks and months, windows rolled down
Pass small cities and big ones too
I brought one promise, not one for you
We drive fast, sunsets low
Wanna reach the sun before I get old
Deserts and fields and the pine trees
Music my father played me
I was a child just like now
I never once thought that feeling could die
Those days came and went
Then you get taken by life by accident
And you wake up somewhere in the shade
Overloaded by what you made yourself
Have to get the things, the ring, a man, a wing
And smile when you don't win
And I say off the road, somewhere I don't know
Just as long as I feel it blow

There's nothing left for me but tears, tears, tears, tears
Everywhere I go it seems I see your smiling face 
But when I get home there's nothing but empty space
That single cigarette we used to share
The time we wasted when I thought you cared
How can I face this life without you near
A life that only holds tears, tears, tears, tears
Who'd ever thought we would be going, going our separate ways
We promised love forever but where, oh, where is love today 
Do, do, do, do

Come back and we will leave the past behind
I'll wipe away your doubt, dispel all your fears

And when the moon, it shines, I will leave two lines
Just find my love, then find me

And while still a lad, I had to go, and so you see I'm rambling still

"Standing room only
You must think my bed's a bus stop
By the way you come and go
I ain't seen you with the lights on
Two nights in a row
So pack your rusty razor
And don't bother with goodbye
Your cup runneth open
But mine is always dry

Standing room only
But I can't stand no more
Standing room only
Outside my door
Don't help me set the table
Cause now there's one less place
I won't lay mama's silver
For a man who won't say grace
If home is where the heart is
Then your home's on the street
Me, I'll read a good book
Turn out the lights and go to sleep

"My hillbilly baby the sweetest gal in town
You can bet I'll see her when the sun goes down
Someday I will marry her I hope I'm not too late
But until she's older oh I guess I'll have to wait
Well I know I'm mighty lucky a country boy like me
If I make her happy happy I will be
So until the wedding day I hope the time's not far away
I'll be waiting my hillbilly baby

Now I've heard song about the valleys and the mountain shacks
Songs about most every moon I know
But I'd rather sing the songs bout that gal of mine
She's the cutest little girl I know
My hillbilly baby...

"On the banks of the roses, my love and I sat down
And I took out my violin to play my love a tune
In the middle of the tune, O she sighed and she said
O Johnny, lovely Johnny, Would you leave me
O when I was a young man, I heard my father say
That he'd rather see me dead and buried in the clay
Sooner than be married to any runaway
By the lovely sweet banks of the roses
O then I am no runaway and soon I'll let them know
I can take a good glass or leave it alone
And the man that doesn't like me, he can keep
his daughter home
And young Johnny will go roving with another
And if ever I get married, twill be in the month of May
When the leaves they are green and the meadows
they are gay
And I and my true love can sit and sport and play
On the lovely sweet banks of the roses",Folk

You are my raindrop I am the sea
With you and God,who's my sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully

You make the confusion Go all away

You set me free

Called life without you here with me

Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am Baby you
Were my man
I know it ain't easy Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me

Your child I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful To have you by my side

My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes

Feel, To breathe, To love you

Locked on collision--wrong over right between boy and girl
Call it the fashion--but can you deny your vices are one up on you
Caught in the patterns--longin' to fly...sayin' it's all you can do
When you're the only one...you see the lonely one
Ashes to ashes, dust into night and a trail of blue
Split screens and sidewalks...six strings and nighthawks and someone new
You got your answers and you got some time...but sometimes they run out on you
You got your reasons and you got your lies...but sometimes they leave you
Lonely, so lonely...lonely so lie
When you're the only one...you feel the lonely one
Now you're the only one...you see the lonely one
You try to be certain...you're certain to try
Chasin' your shadows...changin' your mind
Facin' those faces again and again and again...
Turn from the window and walk through the shadows of love gone by
Searchin' your manner way down inside, still you don't know why
Lost in the mirror you're hopin' to find the fountain that's run out on you
You got your rhythm and you got your lines, but sometimes they leave you
Lonely so lonely...lonely so lie
When you're the only one...you feel the lonely one
Now you're the only one...you see the lonely one
And you go on and on and on
You see the lonely one

I ain't got nowhere else to be
On a distant island's sandy shore
I'm already out to sea
The thought of us is all I see
I want it to be all I know
But it's not yet reality
How much further do I go?
And it's too late to fool ourselves
That there's nothing there
And it's too late to pretend that we don't care
And I don't want to wait
Until it's too late
If love equals frustration
Then it's frustration that I crave
But when this is an obsession
I just want to be saved
Now I know that if I drown
Only I can be blamed
For I feel my body dragging down
And my ship's sailing away",Indie

A fishing pole sinks faster than a tackle box
Nothing turns a day around like licking a mixing bowl

A garbage can is a damn good spot to hide truck keys
Why go inside when you can go behind a tree?
Walking barefoot through the mud will knock the rust
right off your soul
I learned that from a three year old
You can be a cowboy on the moon
Dig to China with a spoon
Talk to Jesus on the phone
Say I love you all day long
And when you're wrong, you should just say so
I learned that from a three year old
Mama is an angel, I heard him tell the man upstairs
He went on and on and back and forth like God was laying there
Tonight, I sleep me down to lay and pray to keep my soul
Yeah, I learned that from a three year old
You can be a cowboy on the moon
Dig to China with a spoon
Talk to Jesus on the phone
Say I love you all day long
And when you're wrong, you should just say so
I learned that from a three year old

Couple arms to kill the cold

"Beneath her clothes her heart is breaking
Spends her mornings making lines
Though her pain is real and aching
All she owns are borrowed lines
Doesn't know which side to be on
Though she's trying every door
Only needs the floor she sleeps on
All she asks is a little more time
Bobbie's gone to California
I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before
The day she left her shirt was clinging
To her back wet with rain
I watched her leave heard her singing
A song she wrote when Christmas came
Bobbie's young but getting older
The face she shows is not her own
Winter's near it's getting colder
California's called her home again
Bobbie's gone to California
I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before
The mirror gives back no reflection
Of shadow she will not see
It understands she needs protection
Of what she swears she has to be
Bobbie's nights are empty tables
Hold her 'til she's made to leave
Bobbie's dreams are empty fables
She makes herself believe
To be free
Sometimes she cried because of visions
Of what she loved had all been sold
There's not much left no one to listen
To the echoes that she holds
How could I tell her when she's fading
She run out of a place to be
There will be no one waiting
For the poetry of her soul
I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before",Country

On your own front door
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that will sing

"I stand alone
Burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
A stronger tide is coming and I've been running
trying to function fine with out my mind
climbing out this fucking corner
I was born a thorn away from the rotten petals
A forgotten rebel crafted in the absence
of heaven's heavy hands,
to develop an evident level of benevolence
so it's probably better I sold my soul to the devil
This is a message to anyone I met that thinks they know me
Don't pretend to understand any of the issues that I'm holding
I was in a rush to grow up, look Mom no cuts
Just a stomach in disgust, and the fear
that I might go nuts this year
If I don't slow up, I'll see you one my way
One day this shit'll kill me but I guess that it's OK
I've lost all fate in a world so full of hate
I don't fucking love music I just use it to escape
I'm caught between wanting to punch someone in the face
and putting a bullet in my head to leave the human race
Everything takes its toll but there's no tolls I can take
I haven't yet found a good reason to be awake
Introducing the corroded bones I had behind my smile
I'm angry at the universe for the way she treats me now
And keeps me down, stealing all my energy
I'm feeling like my enemy, concealing my identity
Not dealing with my tendencies
I peel the skin and then I squeeze
The real imprinted Hanse's disease
Not human in this century, I'm kneeling the entity
Who built this penitentiary, It's filthy as a centipede
And guiltless in a sense cause he was willing to
just let me bleed, While I wore a game face
In 10 years don't check for me I'll be in the same place
This planet is just an overpopulated mental hospital
Each zombie walks around constitutes another obstacle
So here it is I'm finally coming out my shell
All 19 years of my life have been in conflict with myself
I'm insecure by every facet of the existence
From my addictions, to the conditions I choose to live in
Who you kidding I suffer from excess anxiety
A product of pollution in American society
Stare into my eyes and see the hell that burns inside my mind
and I no longer have an ego I can hide behind
But I've been disregarding my insanity
Every form of art isolates you from humanity
But it's provoked against being force fed
so Fuck education for a decade and 3 years
of headaches from my peers
Cause now I realize I could have learned more on my own
They taught me how to know everything except my soul
Which is everything I need to grow
Everything that keeps me whole
Everything that ever meant anything to Eyedea
So I leave with golden hope
to rip the beast that holds my focus
but the fact remains the same, I'm still bound by chains
It doesn't matter if your chain is 10 ft or 100 ft
The fact remains the same, you're still bound by chains
So people say I've changed, and it's harder to relate to me
Good, I never liked you our friendship was make believe
I'm peeling the mask back and revealing the wrath that's been
Filling my organs drilling distorted short portions
of morbid masochistic torture that unfortunately crafted an interest to orbit my portrait and inflict my image with disorder,
The minutes get shorter, the walls start to close in
Feels like the brain is hanging on but with clothes pins
I've hidden in the darkness for too long
I make it look all right but in the inside its so wrong
I want life to change but I don't know if it can
for a man or machine or whatever the fuck I am
I stand alone burned every bridge over the trouble water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
You want to die in my life then come and stay
in madness' favorite little corner
Cause even Shadows have Shadows
and my secrets are eating me eagerly feeding
I scream in my dreams Away but they keep on defeating me
Even Shadows have Shadows
Welcome to the dusty subconscious of an actor
Who murdered his childhood to stop the audience's laughter
Even Shadows have Shadows
I'm about to break free from my fears
When I don't like what I see
and I can't feel what I hear
Even Shadows have Shadows
So don't judge my book by it's cover
Cause my story is fucked up as any other!",Hip-Hop

Ten years old, the torture never ends
One day at recess she pulls him aside
She's taking his hand, She looks in his eyes
She's steppin' in close, So no one can hear
Then she whispers in his ear
She says
Tell me all your secrets
And I won't tell anybody
Pinky swear that I'm the one you love
When the world is dark
And you could swear you have no body
Look to the sky, it's written in the stars
Cross my heart
Time flies to graduation
They leave the party
Take a drive
She keeps asking where they're going
He laughs and looks away, it's a surprise
Out on the playground, right where they stood
Down on one knee he asks if she would
He gives her the ring, She starts to cry
It's the first night of the rest of their lives
Tell me all your secrets
And I won't tell anybody
Pinky swear that I'm the one you love
When the world is dark
And you could swear you have no body
Look to the sky, it's written in the stars
Cross my heart

Real fast, In a small town
When you think your life is passing you by
It kills him to let her go
But she wants to fly
So he gives her the wings
And tells her goodbye

He was early now he's waiting
And the people rush the doors
Some are laughing
Some are crying
Up on the platform

He looks all around
But damned disappointment hangs like a shroud
Suddenly a voice rings out
Says
Tell me all your secrets
And I won't tell anybody

When the world gets dark
And you think you have no body
Look to the sky, it's written in the stars

He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib
New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around
Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it
I need some time, and I want some space
I gotta get away from the human race?
Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!
Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell
Just play ball or be an entertainer
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, HUH!
If only I could sleep just ten more minutes
I might find the strength to make another day
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat
Who you lookin' at with a face like that?
New York New York big city of dreams
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around
On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction
One young punk just leaning on the fence
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up
One dead punk, killed by the man
New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around
Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much! Huh!
A baby cries and a mother dies
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot
And in the ghetto your life is all you got
So you take to the streets, trying to exist
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be
But when you look outside the only thing you see
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces
Much hate and hunger throughout the races
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!""
You don't have enough money to help feed two
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail
When you put your baby in the garbage pail
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane
New York New York big city of dreams

"I saw it moving in the darkened sky
the gods arriving through the clouds
Forgotten but not forgiven
remembering all their outrage
I'll not forget when I am dead
They struck the ground I stood on
took away every soul
undressed my mind and destroyed my shadow
I am doomed to walk towards the end
Forgotten but not forgiven
remembering all their outrage
I'll not forget when I am dead
I'll not forgive when I arise
I'll not forget when I am dead
In a state of mind
that can not be felt
it can not be seen
it's like an unconcious terror

out of the frames
but the rest were burnt in flames",Metal
"Although the flames they are so dim,
I can see them from over here.
But this is no time to worry now,
No time to shed a tear.
The people are all smiling,
And the letters are all too,
The flowers they are all arranged
And the notes they are all blue.
Where are the words to say to you,
Where do they all begin.
I should not have a lot to lose
And everything to win.
And I want you to be smiling,
I want you not to cry.
And even if I hide away,
Then you'll get the notion why.
A symphony I learnt at school,
In pigeonholes so clear,
But it made me for to write no songs,
For nobody to hear.
And I see you are all smiling
Even in the candle light.
Just close your eyes and fall asleep,
And I think you'll be alright.
Close your eyes and fall asleep,
And I think you'll be alright.",Folk
"I still see my brother Michael,
Pressed and polished, shaking hands down at the store
Everyone had come to see the all-star hop the greyhound bus and go to war
He punched me in the arm to say goodbye
It was the first time that I saw our father cry
I kept all my brother?s letters tied in ribbon in a box beneath my bed
Every night I read by flashlight with the covers in a tent above my head
His words said ?Not to worry, doing fine?
It was his way of trying to ease my mind
While I was trying not to read between the lines
The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn?t seem fair that an innocent boy
Should have to carry the weight of the world
Then it was football games and homecoming and
Picking out our dresses for the prom
With my brother in some desert dodging bullets when he wasn?t dodging bombs
While we went from the land of brave and free
To just being afraid to disagree
While I was being brought down to my knees by
The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn?t seem fair that an innocent boy
Should have to carry the weight of the world
It was the middle of December when the Army sent my brother home at last
While the flagpole by the football field flew the colors half-way down the mast
The wind blew cold and snow was coming down
Still everybody turned out from our town
As we laid my brother in that frozen ground
The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much was lost, so much was missed
It doesn?t seem fair that any boy or any girl
Should have to carry the weight of the world",Country

I'm fed up with you looking
Like the cat who got the cooking
I said A U
You and me outside
You've got the kind of face
The face of a git
And I really want to hit it
I said A U
You and me outside
'Cause I've been watching you
Chatting up all the girls
And I'm fed up with you
And I've drunk enough
Someone's gonna get a slap tonight
Someone's gonna get whacked tonight
Someone's gonna get a smack tonight
From me, and it's gonna be you
A U you look like a poof
How loud do I shout it?
Tell me what you're gonna do about it?
A U you and me outside
You're a bloke who's heading for one
A real fist magnet if ever I saw one
A U you and me outside
I saw you kiss that girl
Over in the corner
It's not jealousy
It's just you and me
Someone's gonna get a slap tonight
Someone's gonna get whacked tonight
Someone's gonna get a smack tonight
From me, and it's gonna be you
You've got too much dosh, you're everything I hate
You talk all posh, you make me so irate
You're so cock sure, you're a liability
I told you before, it's not jealousy
It's not jealously
It's just you and me
Someone's gonna get a slap tonight
Someone's gonna get whacked tonight

"There's nothing a god can give to me that I can't give to myself
I put my beliefs in the things I believe and a god can take care of himself
There's not enough love in the world for me to think about wasting my time
It's not that I don't believe at all but I don't need a heavenly sign
I can achieve the things I need without getting down on my knees
I can respect your religion but I don't want to pay your fees
I don't want to hear you talk about the things you think that I need
so don't help me back on my feet again until you can hear me plead
Just look in the holy book of crooks and tell me what you can find
All the rules and the regulations made to manipulate your mind
Don't pretend that you're blind just open your mind and study historical times
The bigger the loss the bigger the cost the bigger the cross and its crimes
I don't believe in a god that I need to worship
I don't believe that I need to get down on my knees
I don't believe that a voice from above can help me
I only believe in what I can see and the things that I can achieve
Whatever belief you belong to there's still always a reason to doubt
and there's always another opinion as to what life is all about
There's always a bigger dimension and a different point of view
so I don't want to try to change you that decision is up to you
Whatever your final choice is and however you choose to live
You'd better be happy for what you can get and happy for what you can give
There's only one thing to remember there is only one thing you can do
and that is to do unto others as you'd have others do unto you
I don't believe in a god that I need to worship
I don't believe that I need to get down on my knees
I don't believe that a voice from above can help me
I only believe in what I can see and the things that I can achieve
Two sides two sides to every story
two stories more makes four new ones to choose
Four sides four sides to every story
four stories more makes eight new ones to choose
Eight sides eight sides to every story
eight stories more now which one should you choose
now which one can you use
I don't believe in a god that I need to worship
I don't believe that I need to get down on my knees
I don't believe that a voice from above can help me
I only believe in what I can see and the things that I can achieve",Metal

Everyday, all day all we do is get our grind on
From sun up to sun down get our grind on
Tryna bust it wide open and build up my clank
Send a hit at these niggas so we could be the jank
You now how it is want everything for myself
Want every nigga scorin for me nobody else
Imma dog it ain't not secret I want it all
Tha coke, dope, hoes and tha fancy cars
Tha game is cold but it's fair nigga
Can't trust no man 'cause a nigga don't care nigga
Nigga will do anything just to be tha man wit all tha work
Kidnap yo wife and yo daughter erase you off tha earth
Them niggas cut throats this shit is real 'causeen
Better know tha game 'cause if you don't you get killed 'causeen
Be ready to take a nigga to war behinds yours
Spark when it get dark and leave brains on the curve

Why you blockin us
Baller Blockin us
You niggas can keep tryin
Ain't no stoppin us

Niggas baller blockin so they lettin off shots
Tha feds came through can't stop tha clock
Then why a nigga up tryna close my shop
Lovely came through in a Bentley drop
Tha cadilac truck we painted then got hot
Still runnin through them hallways tote'n a glock
Word got around Curly tryna close my shop
Tha mail man down bad he can grab tha glock
Tell tha stupid hoe shut up she bouts to get popped
Tha cameras out and them lights is on
Them feds com'n through and they gettin it on
So we duck and hide, supply and ride
Big party goin down wit Big Wood tonite
So we cocked tha glocks
'cause tha beef is rock
Niggas shootin out windows instead of head shots
Believe that playboy


Niggas be gold killin
 slippery like grease create y'all bin on a  scrilla
Call tha police on a young busta just tryna money mack on a million
You best respect tha game or get yo cap pilled in
Whoopin ass and takin names about my pay
Straight up out tha year 2000 Y2K
We ain't fit tha bearin fuck bamas, , 
How bout Atlanta you know
We ain't gotta smash pennies to make  no mo

See that's why lil niggas like you get murder over 'caine
Put yo self in a spot where you won't be working again

You broke 'em off a package and they tryna misuse ya
Now tell 'em who got assed out you and me too huh
And Bubba want his money so I gotta kill you now
And all these muthafuckin laws tryna take mines

"It's goin' down tonight, you know I gots to go get fitted
Hit the mall to get it, then I stop to get my hair
Twisted up in pony tails
Then sell a bill, back to the grain
And let my peoples know, you know it's goin' down tonight
Merry livin'
I got the 4-1-1 on the bumpin'
We ridin' we them heat, as if they funk
And them we dumpin'
I'm slumpin' in the meantime
My speakers is jumpin' up out they box
I see these broads choosin', man they sprung on my Shirly locks
Ugh, made the block
And they was all up on my bumper
Tryin' to pull me over
But now I gets a nothin' when I'm sober
Hit the gas and smoked it up, smashed off, I'm outtie
Bendin' corners, laughin' 'cause I left they car cloudy
Went to my partna house and they was postin', splittin', Vegas
Bet 5 dollas a game on Mat and 95 on Sega
Taggin' out the room, fools layin' on the ground
They better have some get back 'cause tonight it's goin' down


It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it goes down
It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it goes down

Closed up shop on the Sega, now we slammin' bones
Up in my hood, it's on, we make a casino up out yo' home
Head up, I sets 'em down fast for the stash
Yellin' ""stand up!"" when you pass
Turn over your bones and give me your cash
I hit the store with the money I won to get me a 4-0
A double O on the scene, I'm a O-G on the ink fo' sho'
I get twisted up in knots, ?per? straight sloppy
Prize breaders on my nuts and haters want to knock me
Can't understand how deep I get
When I split this real on real da real
Straight up out they heels due
In a minute we'll still talk
Boots stompin', outta my head
To the womp, and get my knees dirty
When I'm stinkin', I'm on da dots for Thompson
Side bettin', Little Joe in the doe
Now watch me roll
I let 'em go and watch that double duece lock up fo' sho'
I talk static, clown
Walkin' around & makin' my rounds
Snatchin' my money up off the ground
'Cause tonight it's goin' down


Shot to the house to get dressed, it's finally night fall
Jumped in my 7-4, smashed it, 'cause I'm tight why'all
Checkin' to see if the tape was on the passenger seat
I need some heat
The only way I'm gon' creep
Late night through these faulty streets
Hit the block & seen the whole crew on the corner
Smellin' that aroma, talkin' about the bump and comin' up on her
Super fast, sumpin' cool
You know how we do it
Touch 'em wit some game
And fill 'em wit some dick fluid
We hit then store, it's about 30 playas bailin' in
Give me some see & be	, some Hennessy, & Sequels Gin
Let me squeeze but no chasin', fool we straight lacin'
Jumpin' and mobbin', punchin' 'til the both of us playas racin'
We pulls up and see 'em posted outside
Gettin' gone
I'm in the zone, ready to take me somethin' home
Wall to wall breaders, top notch, it's mean, it's goin' down
At this bump I found
Tonight fool, it's goin' down

Are you thinking of are you thinking of me

Does your body still scream my name x2

Til you die to come through with guilt
So your blood is filled
When I see the blood worth coming
Would I check out the blood
Even if I was dead
You would never be on the fucking top

Rolling good weed on a big boat
Counting blue ships, all C-notes
And crispy head cash in my Avirex coat
Talking outside, been there since Phat Farm
Big shit, letting off car alarms
Bar lovely with chain with the gun charm
And he even cut me loose in the lazar
If I got it then I paid for it
Name solid, did my thang for it
Had your lil bitch, you ain't even know it
Had an extra hammer, let my cousin hold it, get 'em, let's go

Where the city where the Rich at

Bought a pound and a lot of it's gone
Always on point, never out of my zone
And if I ain't fuck her, never got her alone
I'm in and out of cars, got a lot of new homes
On the real, I'mma let it be known

Translation

On the green stubble-fields of autumn
I saw you, my sweetheart.
Nice were your feet in shoes
And wonderful your nimble gait.
Your hair the color of roses
And your ringlets tightly plaited
Alas that we're not married
Or on board ship sailing away
The boys around here are
Laughing and getting bold
And the people of the high straw?
Are making ? ? of my brown girl
If the king of spain would
Go abroad with his assembled men
I would flatten grass and rank grass
And I would be with my brown girl
Buying cows at the fair
If I were ? and my brown girl
Go and come first love
Until we go over to gaoth-bearra
Until we separate from each other
The tops of the branches and the swan
From the waves ?
That won't separate us
And it's only folly for you to put it ? ?
I wrote a letter
To my sweetheart and a sharp complaint
She sent it back to me
That her heart was inside me.
Compose the artsswannoble person ?
Finer than silk or bird feathers
Heavy is my sigh
When I think of being apart from her.
What I heard on Sunday
As conversation among the women
That she was going to be married
To a young man from the place.
Sweetheart take my advice
And this autumn stay as you are
And don't tell anyone, my love,
That you are my love.",Folk
"I saw a man today who said he talked to you
Not so long ago, I think a month or two
As my mind raced back in time I prayed
Oh, Lord, don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
It takes a mighty strong love to keep a man thinking of
A girl he hasn't seen since fifteen years ago
I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy
And so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing from fifteen years ago
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
It takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know I've tried since fifteen years ago",Country
"
Everyday my thoughts of you
Get more and more intense
I get closer to the truth
I`m that much more convinced
That you and I were mean to be
No what or its involved
As long as you got love for me
Our problems will be solved
-Section
So do you love him? no
Do you think of me? yea,yea yea
You don`t want him? no
Cause you`d rather be with me
After all the shit he put your through
Why wouldn`t you want to leave
Girl,I got mad love for you
Why can`t you be with me

I`ll be your lover
I`ll be your friend
I`ll be your one true confident
I`ll be the smile on your face
When we make love and consummate
I`ll be the one good that won`t let you down
I am not afraid
Afraid to love,afraid to trust
Or just communicate
I`ll be your partner
I`ll be your man
I`ll be the kind that understands
That you got wants
And you got needs
And I got s`ponsabilities
I`ll be the one good lover that`s down for you
I am not afraid
Afraid to share,afraid to give or, just communicate

Everyday he lies to you
Bout things that he won`t say
From simple things like denying you
From asking about this day
It bothersome to think that he
Be playing you that way
You deserve much more,this I`m sure
So send him on his way
-Section
Cause you don`t love him? no
You always think of me? yea,yea,yea
You don`t want him? no
Cause you`d rather be with me
After all the shit he put you though
It`s true for you to leave
Girl,I`ve got mad love for you
You`re supposed to be with me

"All you wanna be is insane
Wishing you were more than just plain
And when you try you try too hard it comes off fake
Many times I wanted to say
Plastic people like you will break
And soon enough it caught up and you went away
And if I never see you again
It'll be too soon to make amends
And if I never see you again
It'll be too soon to make amends
You like it when you make people wait
It's the only time you're calling the plays
Controlling nothing makes you execrate
Everybody knows you're in pain
We all know it stems from the shame
Because your actions called for a drastic fall from grace
And if I never see you again
It'll be too soon to make amends
And if I never see you again
It'll be too soon to make amends
You suck up life like you're a needle
Sticking in a vein for life
Keep up appearances when needed
You're used to changing overnight
I always wondered if you saw
What the rest of us could see

Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't see the forest for the trees

Symphony from my deepest sorrows
Played by tortured angels

Heroes from past they battle at last
Slowly I die away from this world
Entering another dimension
White clad they walk by my side
Their laughters I still hear

On the Hollywood world,
And the heroine waits
For her beau to return,
And violins play
From behind garden walls,

Of an old fashioned waltz.
As they dance round the floor,
And there's no-one else there,
And the world is no more
And there's never a care,
By the perfect lagoon
Where the nightingale calls,
With only the moon
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz.

And stories to tell as they age
Then maybe time will decide
Which ones keep and which ones fade

There's the deepest sleep in my life,
From which I am slowly coming to
And every morning I wait for the news
Oh this is, this is post war blues
Make me a means to an end
Oh make me an ending in sight
Make me insightful again
What I can't see, I can't fight
Make me a fire to burn
Burn all the letters I wrote
Write me a list of concerns
If we are at peace
If we are at ease
I want to know

Oh this is, this is post war blues",Indie
"Avatars of powers from four worlds
Bathed me in jewels of belief
I drink the nectar of Goddess - my eternal mistress
I am Shiva, Hadit or Beast himself
And multitude of forms surpasses myself
I kneel before Isis, I - her god and slave
Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes
Third power and third eye create The One
I am who I am not
I negate and confirm
I transgress, it is real!
Wheels of change turn with my breath
I touch the red - hot firmament 
And stars are falling down onto every side of world
With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis
Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth
Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom

As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven by the side of the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever and where separation comes no more

Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey and perhaps we'll never meet anymore

I had to get myself a dial tone
I started callin' everybody tryin' to get back home
But everybody that I called was being difficult
I took it personal and took it as an insult

The job I do is boring, they all hate me anyway
The days are long, the nights are just an alcoholic haze
The weekends come and go, nothing different, nothing new
I smoke because I need to and I drink because there's nothing else to do


Somebody always fucks it up with a knife in the back or a bullet in the guts
One door opens, another one shuts, somebody always f***s it up
People think I'm crazy but I'm gonna make 'em pay
Let 'em laugh for now, the tears will soon be hear to stay

Slap me til I cry

So full of hate but short
Short on compassion
Short on humanity

I still have a dream, we will be able to speed up that day
When all of God's children, black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics
Will be able to join hands and sing ""Free at last, free at last
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last""

"Cautious with the image that I'm givin'
What used to be appealin' is the shit that I'm resentin'
Feel like I ain't livin', I'm dealin' with so much
On the low, I'm actin' tough, but I ain't been happy in a minute
And what's crazy is this is just the beginning
Ridin' 'round Vegas tryna build my foundation
That immediate happiness is awaitin'
But I feel it's overrated, I'm keepin' a clear conscience
I just wanna do my own thing
A good heart
But what if I'm out here fightin' for the wrong things?
Became a daddy and started watching my behavior
Helpin' niggas out, but niggas runnin' out of favors
It ain't about the paper, it's about what you gon' do with it
You on your music tip, but tell me, is you the creator?
These niggas don't know how to act
I should've been a school counselor
To see what they'd get out of that
All I wanna do is help, if it's a little
Got up in this game to really try and make a change
Wanna settle down, but this shit is so confusin'
I'm just goin' through a stage where I'm learnin' how to be brave
Fuck a phase, this is life, all I need is me
Look into my daughter's eyes and then I get the water eyes
If I die, I pray to God she know her father tried, word.
'Cause we just wanna live our lives
Embraced faith, went against all odds
In our eyes, to judge niggas, that is not our job
To be a man, it is not that hard

Ayo, it's time to be a man, understand, we gon' kill 'em with kindness
And you know you gotta fuckin' hold your own
Can't let them take us away from the fam'
We gon' kill 'em with kindness
Now I'm thinkin' in reality
Actually, I was thinkin' 'bout stability
I watched my single mother's feet hurt for years
Just to barely pay the bills, I don't know, that shit's killin' me
But I don't wanna live like that
Mama, I don't wanna see you live like that
I told my little brothers we can build a new life
For the ones that gave us life, we can give that back
I know we tend to hold grudges
I can't control it, I'm unfolding the emotion that I'm holdin'
Hope the way I saw it ain't the way I won't approach it
I'm just focused on the better me, this rap shit is my pedigree
Lately I've been feelin' life testin' me
She say she down, and she say she wanna ride
Release the need to please or be validated by eyes
In disguise, I'm just focused on what makes me come alive
I've learned not to take nothin' personal
Bad environments have been my disadvantage
Not tryna be accepted, it stepped me out of my box
And now these niggas watch me like I got all of the answers
But this is what I've built for myself
Realistic, always had to keep it real with myself
So when they talk, and it's negative or it's false
We channel out the negative thoughts without any help

Is beyond your wildest dreams
And although it seems that I'm on the nigga hoe team
Girl listen listen Mary don't you weep
I don't come cheap and I'm not just no nigga off the street
I'm a certified specialized pro
Who's got a lot of soul when you're swingin'
Off the end of my pole
But the matter at hand is the size
And how it makes ya act
When you get it up and in between your thighs
You could squirm and squeal and try to make a deal
That'll keep me on your jock
For whenever you get that feelin' for the real
And when it gets swollen
You think you'll be controllin' me
Because I put the pole in your hole, see
But however it's done, it's 68 and I owe you 1
I'm doin' it for the thrill of it
So tell me can you feel it?
Itz your fantasy baby, tell me if you feel it
You know you want to feel it
Itz your fantasy, sing it if you feel it
Okay, let's find a place, somethin' out of dodge
Like the Quality Inn or the Travelodge
Since I'm goin' out of my way
Baby you pay for the spot
See it's only right since you gettin' the cock
Now tell me who's gonna get the rubbers?
First things first, yes I like a bitch
Who carries Lifestyles in her purse
So since you know the play
Close the curtains all the way
And get ready for a toss and some rib sauce
With a little weed I could do a good deed
And as long as you ain't bleedin'
I can give you what you need
But I got a little ritual before we make love
You gotta dish-a-dish-a-scrub
Wash-a-wash-a-wash-a-rinse in the bathtub
Hennessy and apple juice to sip on
Get a little buzzed and we can get our dig on
So don't trip cause when you
Takin' off your clothes to reveal it
I'm a make you feel it
Sing it if ya feel it, it's your fantasy baby
Touch me if ya feel it, I need to know if you feel it
Can you feel it baby?
Now put it where you want it, get in where you fit in
Cause when it comes to hittin' it, splittin' it
I ain't bullshittin'
See, you look so good you make me want to go bare back on ya
But I ain't hittin' unless I use the whole pack on ya
Bitch didn't ya know I have more stamina than a horse?
So don't trip just let the Hen take it's course
Yeah right now your frontin',
Shy, actin' like you nervous, naw, turnaround, lay down
And let me pound on your cervix
Yeah, it's the Log Ride, like at Magic Mountain
Take it out your mouth and shoot it like a fountain
Pull and watch it explode
Let me change my tire and I'm right back on the road
Now is this more than you expected?
You let me drive that coochie and I wrecked it
So even though I'll never get another chance to kill it
It's cool just as long as I made you feel it
Itz your fantasy, tell me if you feel it
You know you love it, sing it if you feel it
You make me feel it, I know you feel it
You know you feel it, tell me if you feel it
Sing it if you feel it
Yeah, you feel it, I love to make you feel it

Feel the heat
I'll keep on breathing

Save my soul, find a way
And if I fail, will it all be over?

So fleeting and vague
Once again I will bring down the mountain
One last glimpse
It is costantly slipping away

""I will never give up""
The inner war
I can hold against it
My mind, my mind
My mind's in darkness
The young man says
""I will never give in""
The prophecy
Behold it's true
I conquer the flame
To release the insane
I'm crying
I cannot erase
I'm the dragorn reborn
And in madness
I soon shall prevail
Twice I'll be marked and
Twice I shall live
The heron sets my path
And name me true
Twice I'll be marked and
Twice I shall die
My memory's gone
But twice I pay the price
Wheel of time
Save my soul
Find a way
May it be as the pattern has chosen
Oh, wheel of time
Turn the wheel of time

There's no beginning
There's no end, wheel of time
There's no beginning

When the foreman's wife pulled up in her Lincoln and she said I been looking for you
The old man went home early do you wanna take a ride to town
I said I guess it couldn't do no harm and I threw my hammer down
We were shootin' straight tequila when the foreman came stormin' in
He said honey now didn't I warn you what I'd do if I caught you again
She pulled out her little pistol she fired and he hit the ground
She grabbed my arm we jumped into that Lincoln and I put that hammer down
Hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Just put that hammer put that hammer down
Well I heard the sirens moanin' just east of New Orleans
She cried out to the trooper thank God you rescued me
When they dragged me into the courtroom I knew where I was bound
That old judge threw the book at me then he threw his hammer down
Hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Just throw that hammer throw that hammer down
On a chain gang out of Houston one August afternoon
I see that same old Lincoln and at the wheel there's a brand new fool
Then the warden taps my shoulder says son quit your foolin' around
In ninety-nine years you can lay that hammer down
Oh hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Throw that hammer throw that hammer down

We got to be

I want to be

Yes, its for the people, God moves, yeah
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful
Faithful to thee
Faithful to thee
Faithful to thee
I'd like to be her very best friend
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together""
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
""Baby you a blessin' and my best friend""

Instead let's go to Goobies and have ourselves a beer

Come take a look at Gander, Blackhead's mighty grand
Don't let the names deceive you, Newfoundland's mighty fine
So spend a night on Dildo if you think you've got the time
Well you can go to Blow-Me-Down before it get's to dark 
Oh sorry ma'am, I should have said, that's our provincial park
There's also Whippet Harbour, or maybe Butter Pot
Or maybe I'll just hit the pub I'm feeling like a shot
Well you can sail on Quidi Vidi, or look at Joe Batt's Arm
There's Placentia and there's Cow Head , they're so full of charm
Get married down in Kilbride, have a party in Hate Bay
Or have some screech in Fogo and forget about the day

Bumpin' Curtis May field or Marvin, somethin' smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha, ha
Man I watched the sun go up but come down, sayin' what if?

"God bless
Uh, Feeling like I been crucified
Haven't been the same since my daughter died
Paranormal flourished in my state of mind
Kinda hard for me to orchestrate a fucking rhyme
Last night I took some pain killers
And I became friends with a death dealer
Couple minutes later I was stupid numb
Slowly blinking, thinking where I got this pistol from
Damn I was fucked up
Still wonder why my daddy had abandoned us
Lost my dog when he decided to put them hammers up
Left the dope game so crackers couldn't jam him up
Heatin' pain off in my cold heart
These niggas playing foul like a false start
How my youngest pull your card like it's Hallmark
Choppa stop a nigga like a cross guard
Oh Lord I'm a mad man
Screaming starvation to the motherland
Never money over brothers man
I don't think they understand
Hear the pain that I'm so poor
It's like the lions when the pack roar
Come meet the last of a dying breed
Guaranteed that this some shit you've never seen
Black man, no Carters to greet
Still I made a way for my mama to eat
Million dollars made and I did it in peace
But still I am a flirt to the fucking police
I forever be a field nigga

One was young and one was old and the gay young fool was me
Since neighter one could write his name we swore upon our souls
To share the wealth and then shook hands the hands that dug for gold
The summer days were gone at last and winter nights grew cold
The snow had trapped us in the pass when we finally find the gold
We took our fortune to the shack to wait the winter through
But the food ran low so I killed my friend what else there was to do
I threw his body just outside into the bitter cold
Somehow I had to stay alive I now had all the gold
But the howling wind just seemed to say you have killed a man
And you'll never get to spend the gold with the blood upon your hands
The cabin's covered now with snow and shelves of food are bare
Satan's waitin' for me now and I'm too cold to care

Telling my homies be careful o' the things that you do
Cuz I went out, assed out
I shoulda never tripped and put my lips in between hips
But I used to eat that thang that didn't sit on a plate
Didn't taste like stank I up and left about 8
But I had to build her make for the fact that I was young
I was showing to prove the hoochies I could work they pearl tounge
But then game got kilt
Cuz the girl kept pushin' my head all up under the quilt
And I was like damn, you must be sick
You mean you'd rather have a tongue
instead of a pair o' nuts and a stick 
And every single night, I lick it till my tounge turn white
I thought I was a freak till I heard my homies brag
Ya!
So I took that advice and right before I hit it
I took baby monkey lift it up and I bit it
Yeah homeboy I had the coochie in check
But then I got this real bad cramp in my neck

With a full pair o' nuts and a lump in ya throat
Cuz even though shes screamin
She don't want ya semen
She just want a tooounge to keep her ass creamin'
But Im'a let her know baby doll I can't do it
Not in here and fuck cuz all coochie got a taste to it
See I don't know who been digging you out
And licking ya down
I aint the first girl so I can't clown
But instead Im'a tell you how its done
You gotta tell a ho 68 and I owe you 1
Cuz if you don't then she'll play you like a sucka
Have you lickin on a lollipop......Ya
But it aint no trippin on mine 
Cuz tounge condoms are hard to find 
And even if ya dicks protected
You can still catch the high by doing a nose dive
So be cautious and don't be anxious
Even though you never could now you wanna catch ST-Statures

And please don't eat the coochie

Baby girl don't be shy, come dance with me
Me and you on the dancefloor has to be
When I hold you close baby my boo
'Cos you give me a sweet taboo
Your heart's locked up give me the key
Forever my lady you made me see
When I'm with you, girl they don't faze me
In my arms you're a charm you should show it baby
We should slow down, if you're gonna be mine
Don't need to rush let's take our time
 Skip a beat, everytime you're around
Baby you could be my brandy, I wanna be down

Ooohh
Your personality too much to handle
Ya, light up the room like a candle
Can't you see girl
I hope you believe in destiny

The day I met you, I became somebody
Now, I'm standing next to you
You make me feel like somebody

Couple of skeletons in my bed
Couple of skeletons in my wallet
Couple of skeletons in my head
I never shoulda listened to the serpent

You've tasted sherbert so don't point your sticks at me
I've read the ten commandments at large no harm ignoring parts of it
I've had it up to here with the jargon
Pardon? They're my rules I started
Not saying that I don't feel guilty
Silky smooth it's never gonna be
But I'm looking at a man in the mirror right now and I'm not quite sure it's me

Had me workin' on hands and knees, scrubbin' grease
And in the summer with the oven on, it's hundred-ten degrees
I would despise flippin' fries
I guess his bitch-ass thought he was the shit
With his little red and gold tie
I asked him why I couldn't get mo' hours
He said it must be 'cause I lacked the mental powers
If I was smart then I would be in his position
I left his nose in a busted up condition
Only came back for my last check to pay me off
He told me then that he wasn't gonna lay me off
Said I should quit and it would be to my enjoyment

So when I'm dead and gone you can say you know my old shit

Not cause I'm supposed to
Soldiers never show love

"I was born in Saginaw Michigan I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many nights he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan the daughter of a wealthy wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And he said I wadn't good enough to claim his daughter's hand
That's why I'm up here in Alaska lookin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan I said honey I'm comin' home please wait for me
You can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history
Her daddy met the bus in Saginaw Michigan
He gave me a great big party and we drank champagne
Then he said son you're a wise young ambitious man
Don'tcha wanna sell your father-in-law your Klondyke claim
And now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold cold ground
The greedy fool is a lookin' for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missing him

We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw Michigan

While dancing and drinking we all got half tight

When up jumped her boy friend and he hollered at me
Please don't squeeze my Sharmon don't hold her so tight
You'd best keep my warning it's my last one tonight
She's soft and she's gentle and as sweet as can be
And if Sharmon needs squeezing then leave that to me

And me and Miss Sharmon were dancing again
Then Hank and big Harlan got into a fight
And I heard someone holler as out went the light

So I wrote what he said on my sleeve
And if you listen
I will repeat
The words this tiny man did speak
One, Two, Three, Four,
Listen up now here we go

Well I could not understand what he spoke
I thought maybe it was some kind of joke
He laughed at me and before long
This tiny little man was gone
So I walked on and on my way
I met another tiny person that same day
She rode a velvet ant like an elephant
And as I listened I heard her say
Uno, Dos, Tres, Four
Time to go again once more

How can a man like me
Ever repeat ""po piba popi yo""?
It might take all night
Just to get this right
But, yo yam baca chuco
It was somethin' weird
He had a little beard
He wore a rhino beetle
Bullfighter's coat
He had a part in his hair
Like a paper tear
And had a little tiny frog in his throat
What did it mean?
I was all mixed up
And as I stumbled
And hit the ground
What a pity
I found the tiny people's city
And those teenies all made this sound:
Ichi, Ni, San, Shi,
Everybody sing with me

"Things down at my house just ain't going right I'm gonna tie one on tonight
I'm sick and tired of coming home and that gal ain't in sight
I'm gonna tie one on tonight
I wonder what she does all day I wonder where she goes
When I get home she's always gone dressed in her best clothes
I'm going out and live it up chase every girl in sight I'm gonna tie one on tonight

My baby she's out on the town and I think just for spite
And I'm gonna tie one on tonight
She thinks she's gonna worry me but I'll show her all right
I'm gonna tie one on tonight
I'm gonna dance with all the girls and have myself as free
When I get home and find her there crying over me
When I come in at three a.m. there'll prob'ly be a fight
But I'm gonna tie one on tonight yes I'm gonna tie one on tonight",Country
"Turn your head and see the fields of flames
He carries along
From a distant place
He's on his way
He'll bring decay

In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight
Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for starlight we wait for the moon
The sky is empty
Alone in the unknown
We're getting nowhere
We have been betrayed
By the wind and rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made
Should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome
We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight
It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall
Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out
We don't regret it
So many men have failed
But now he's gone
Go out and get it
The madman's head it
Shall be thyne
We don't regret it
That someone else dies hidden in disguise
Go out and get it
Orion's hound shines bright
Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided by the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach
Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra
You may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Sister mine
Death's a certain thing
Find myself in darkest places
Find myself drifting away
And the other world
The other world appears
Find myself she dies in vain
I cannot be freed
I'm falling down
As time runs faster
Moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you
My dear
And then there was silence
Just a voice from other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade
Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end Iliad
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of there
You've chosen misery
Power and wisdom
You deny
Bad choice
War is the only answer
When love will conquer fear
So the judgement's been made to the fairest
The graceful says badly he fails
Warning
Fear the heat of passion, father king
Don't let him in
Don't let her in
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
We can't get out
Once they are in
She's like the sunrise
Outshines the moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price
In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat
Jealousy
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now
The thread of life is spun
The coin's been placed below my tongue
Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side
So we can win
Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side
Old moon's time is soon to come
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose
Like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man
Roar roar roar roar
Troy Troy Troy Troy
And as the lion
Slaughters man
I am the wolf
And you're the lamb
Hallowed Troy will fall
Round the walls
Faith is shattered bodies fall
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose
Like one we'll stand
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out
I feel that something's wrong
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept our of sight
We live we die
Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end Iliad
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
Roam in darkness
Spread the vision
We will be lost if you truly believe
Troy in darkness
There's a cold emptiness in our hearts
That they've gone away
And won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie, lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome
The old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite
The end is near
You better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing
And dance with us now
The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
The war it is over forevermore
No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied
Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die
Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end Iliad
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
Holy light shines on
So the judgement's been made
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
The crack of doom

Teach me to stand up, And how to succeed

Teach me to stay down, And never succeed

Of the streets that normal people walk
Wrong side of the tracks, the deep end of the ocean

Darkness inside out seeps into your veins

The only thing keeping you alive
Is the gracious night

Let me go, let me sleep until forever
Let me close my eyes and hide until the never
Let me go, let me slip into the sky
And tiptoe into madness in a hollow cry
'Cause no one ever told me I committed any crime
And no one ever told me how I went blind
And all I ever wanted was a free mind
A guiltless conscience and a place where I could fly

So if your bitch takes an interest, it is not her fault

Pockets loaded, hey, I must say I take a cake
They speak ill but words don't break him bone
They bounce off him 'cause see him is purchasin' homes
See his stones how they complement each other
Size of the rocks and how they fluctuate in color
That him is me, get a clue, enough's is enough
Took it easy on y'all fuckers and I ain't even rimed my truck
To put it simple, I'm a rarity ma
From the cars to the jewels, what clarity ha
Stick with me, show you life, that's out of this world
And I ain't lyin' to you, love, I only lie to my girl
I lust for the riches, what a treat this is

"I woke up with the power out
Not really something to shout about
Ice has covered up my parents' hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are swinging from the power lines
Nobody's home, so nobody minds
I woke up on the darkest night
Neighbors all were shouting that they found the light

Shadows jumping all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small
I went out into the night
I went out to pick a fight with anyone
Light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ, don't keep it hid!
Ice has covered up my parents' hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
Growing up in some strange storm
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm

I went out to find some light
Kids are dying out in the snow
Look at them go, look at them go!
And the power's out in the heart of man

What's the plan?
Is it a dream? Is it a lie?

Through thunder, storm and rain
On a mission to quell the snakes.
You will search every hole
And turn every stick and stone.
Bring them out to light.
The hooves were pounding over the northland
While the battle cries rise high,
Shaking up the distant skies.
The reaper had them close at hand
Not losing them out of sight
From early morning until the night.
From the southern realm they marched
To gaze into their eyes
Illuminate all the lies
No mercy will be shown
To stop their reckless minds
Burn them out and make them blind

We will descend
In the mist of the twilight tonight
When the sky is clear and the stars shine bright

You are green, you are red, you are ""yuprle"" you are blue, you are gold you are silver

My tears are made of limes
You love me, you hate me, I'm losing my mind

I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon

Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face

Born in the flood
Bloody fingerprint sets
Black marketed fresh
Water canons forget me not
Epitaph airbrush with death
White t's
Wife beaters
Button up
Reattach flesh
In between the lines
Outside of the law
Underneath the veil
We dig our foundations
We navigate the globe
Trying to find a pattern to break the mold
With a family to feed
There's nowhere we wont go
But what if were caught
They say I'm a snitch
Shot at the check point
Found with his throat slit
There's spray paint on the teleprompter
Anchorman screams that hes seen a monster
Mayday
There's bloodstains on his shirt
Mayday
They say that hes gone berserk
Sometimes
When I wanna shut out this world
Wanna rip up this page
Wanna pour out this heart
Wanna get up on this stage
And my lips become percussion
And my fists become the rage
And I pound on this table
Till it gives me something to say
Then I think about things that I've seen
Right in front of me
That I don't wanna believe
Gimme one of these mikes
Lemme let em know
The way that it is is not how its gonna be
Not if we don't let em get ahead of us
The present tensions no threat
Its just a fence across the path
That were already ready to walk
Rock solid footsteps
Let 'em put up obstacles
And prove that it isn't possible
Fuck that
We don't give em any weight
True liberty and freedoms at stake
Peace will never become pass
Live my life until my last day
It was half-past eight in the bat cave
When the cracks in the plaster collapsed
And gave way to gaps in the pavement
Mayday mayday
Put it on blast
For the passengers and messengers
'Cause this is a disaster
Where the fuck are the rescue workers
Not far
Off pissing on a cop car
In the hall with a pop tart
Sipping liquor in the rock bar
Everyone climb to the front line
Lunchtimes canceled
All hands on deck to pull survivors from the landfill
Onlookers passers-by shake off that rubble
Brush off your shoulders
Break free from your standstill
Signs of a better world
Causes we understand
Failures we expected to occur
And bring redemption for our sins
Safety from the crowds
In the shadows on the run
We write our own cider house
Rules to keep alive
Rituals that prove their worth
Search for systems we can trust
Rhythms we can lock into
This is madness salvage teams
Can't bandage
Hope when its damaged
Or broken compassion
Not enough rope in the van when
World is collapsing
Our mode of action
Broadcast through the glass
Its all we can manage
Donate with the plastic
Scraps from the salad
Hoping to balance
Emotions invalidated
And staged on 4:3 aspects
Just ballast for sadness
Lives shattered are standard
Fare for cameras and channels
Stare no abracadabras
No faster answers
Or mantras for disasters
Remastered and plastered
Got it all backwards
Do you know the faction your backing
Its another man down
Another mother gone
Child drowned
Another silenced song
Solitude
Another kind of strong
I miss you
Another strung along
Missing in action
Another page is blackened burned
Turned to ashes to ashes
Dust off the flags and the caskets
We will never find another you
Despite the life of love we knew
These lightning times are trouble who
Cant count the strikes that punished through
The bonds we thought would never break
And never will and never fade and never change
But there is the rage
Of losing you to their mistakes
In between the lines
Signs of a the next movement
Refuge from the crowd
Outside of the law
Causes we understand
Hands that trace
Instructions for descendants in the
Shadows on the run
Underneath the veil
Failures we expected to
Occur and bring redemption for our sins

every dream, every feeling cold
all the ghosts i tried to run from
all the storms rusting into me

NOW THAT YOU AREN'T REAL
THERE'S NOTHING TO REVEAL
i ran on glass, broke my bones so i could find you
i cut myself to be around you
and when i bled, you disappeared
just like you knew i always feared
i closed my eyes, and climbed on you so i could breathe
i hung my noose around your tree
suffered addiction to the air around you
now my whole world exists without you
i was a son, i was an angel falling from heaven
i was a slave to your oppression
the prophets never spoke of reasons
for me or for my bitter freedom
you spit on me, filled my dirt with seeds of black
as i carved your name across my back
burned out my eyes into your sun
oh, can't you see now what you've done to me?
if i close my eyes, will this all go away?
if i take your pill, will it all fade away?
if i wake myself, will my darkness peel?
i can't sleep away because nothing is real.
if i close my eyes, will this all go away?
if i take your pill, will it all fade away?

"The Wind doth blow today my love,
A few small drops the rain.
Never have i had but one true love,
In cold clay she is lain.
I'll do as much for my true love,
As any young man may.
I'll sit and mourn all on her grave,
A twelve month and a day.
The twelve month and a day been gone,
A voice spoke from the deep.
""Who is it sits all on my grave.
And will not let me sleep?""
Tis I Tis I thine own true love,
Who site upon your grave,
For I crave one kiss from your sweet lips,
And that is all i seek.

But my breath is earthy strong.
Had you one kiss from my clay cold lips,
You're time would not be long""

Tomorrow or today,
May God in heaven have all my soul
But I'll kiss you lips of clay.

Is withered to the stalk.

'Cause when you shook me, took me outta my world, I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of
Then you better beware of
The happening
One day you're up, when you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you
I was sure, I felt secure until love took a detour
Yeah! Riding high on top of the world, it happened
Suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams torn apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose a precious love you need to guide you
Something happens inside you
The happening
Now I see life for what it is
It's not of dreams, it's not of bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you

"Conceal of a lie we must defy, stay on the course of belief
Open our eyes, revitalize, look at the source of deceit
Tempting our fate, spreading the hate, in darkness we wait
Hear or we fall, answer the call before it's too late
The roar of the sea I can't believe the time of the end has begun
Mountains will shake, the earth will quake wielding the force of the sun
Rolling the dice, paying the price, our judgment awaits.
Fly. From the sunrise in hell
When our skin turn to dust
In the blaze of the inferno we all stand as one
On the edge of the world, in the wake of the storm
When the time of our end has begun
Sum of all fears echo the years spent on the course of defeat
Biding our time, on the decline lead by the source of conceit
Were running away into the fray from the price we must pay
Blinding the light, thunder will strike, fire's arise from the core
Tremble with fear, the end is near our fate we cannot ignore
Rolling the dice paying the price our judgment awaits
Fly. From the sunrise in hell
When our skin turn to dust
In the blaze of the inferno we all stand as one
On the edge of the world, in the wake of the storm
When the time of our end has begun
As we failed to see how it all came to be
Our reign would come to an end
None will live to tell of the sunrise in hell",Metal

"My heart is a black haunted loom,
Weaving jackets for children who'll never be born.
My hands are abandoned factories
Manufacturing heartbreak and hate for the world.
As we waltz the broken dance of our limbs
This ballroom has been groped by so many evil whims.
As I drill the last hole into you,
The well of your body has hardened into glue.
Everything is going to be just awful when we're around.
All the colors gonna rot off your sight when we're around.
I remember the day that I sold my smile to that nice couple
Who lost their first child.
I threw in a set of sympathy,
And a bucket of popcorn for the cemetary.
But now my face is all fenced off, the sky is boarded up,
The hills covered in drop cloth.
How many chords till this song vomits out real love?
How many feathers to pluck naked the soiled dove?
How many whores till you send away for that trophy?
And how many punches till you give yourself away for free?
Because those bruises on your gace look like the sun setting in disgrace.

Everything is going to be just awful when we're around.
All the colors gonna rot off your sight when we're around.
I am just a salesman pleased to meet you can I show you around.
Every thing must go the shadows the seagulls when we're around.
This is our shame.",Indie
"Every time I close my eyes
Something small within me dies
Can't say if its dark or bright
But its all I've ever known
And when I sleep
I sleep alone
Alone
Alone
Every time I take a breath
Something once living inside me has left
Yes its alive but its just past through
Its just left me and its just left you
On your own
On your own
And I love you most
I love you most
When I first found love in my soul
And I'll give to you
Give it up to you
When I first find it in my self
And the time will come for everyone
For everyone to know
Yes the time will come for everyone
For everyone to go
And say goodbye
And say goodbye
And say goodbye

"Big Jimmy Baker and Marty Gray met at a teenage party
Jimmy took Marty to school the next day both of them were tardy
Sittin' in the parking lot talking over things, waitin' for the morning bell to ring
Two little love birds loose on wing Jimmy Baker and Marty

Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing? Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Big Jimmy Baker's on the football team Marty's wearin' his sweater
Listen to them talking in the locker room man he's a real go getter
Telling Marty bout the facts of life says there'll never be another
Someday she's gonna be his wife he learned that line from his brother

Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing? Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Down at the drive-in Friday night didn't come to see the movie
Parked in back and away from the light Jimmy says isn't this groovy
Under the seat a bottle in a bag made to affect the senses
Poured out a drink for Marty Gray broke down her defense
Kids in love now what can you do but listen to the cooing
Pretty little blonde haired Marty Gray does your mama know
What you're doing? Bet your mama don't know what you're doing
Big Jimmy Baker and Marty Gray no longer goin' together
Fire of love burned out they say Marty's feelin' under the weather
Town turns out to have a big day the football hero's goin' away
But Marty's got the price to pay and Jimmy's gonna let her

"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand.
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

"THE BRAES O' BALQUIDDHER 
1. Oh, the summer time is coming,
And the trees are sweetly blooming,
And the wild mountain thyme
grows around the blooming heather.
Chorus:
Will you go, lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather,
Will you go lassie, go?
2. I will build my love a bower
By yon clear and crystal fountain,
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain.
3. If my true love, she won't have me,
I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather.
4. Oh, the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather.

"Cold silence of never-ending space
Green distance of mountains
Steps into the unknown
Dark depth oceans
Old sanctuary of mother earth
I'm looking for the land of miracles
Cradle of every secret
Eternal peace of paradise
Where memories never die
The wind dancing on the trees
Heavenly music of wanderers
I'm looking for the land of miracles
The road that nobody has walked on
The land that nodody has seen
T'm taken away by the endless horizon
The gates are open and in a glance
And the secrets of the past are closed in this land
Ancient signs
Forgotten ages
A silent idol
Fight and tears
Sorrow and hope
Fables written in blood
Purplse shine of sunset
A star on the black sky

With your invisible radio crackling

And where you go is a mystery

There are rivers raging below these streets
And mountains growing underneath the sea
When you hear hidden decibels
You ask does it happen much to me
Then you beg me to come find you
And pull you back to ground
Tether you to something that won't change
When you get out of range

Nowhere else but here

I drew my saber through her,
It was a bloody night,
I threw her into the river,
It was an awful sight.

That money would set me free
If I would murder that poor little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly.
Now he stands at his cabin door,
Wiping his tears from his eyes,
Gazing on his own dear son,
Upon the scaffold high.

"Where are they now, these giants of my dreams
The ones that seek to kill me?
They run and hide, they see the fire behind my eyes
And they feel the anger that boils beneath my skin
Come out, come out
Come out and say something real
Come out 'cause I feel the apathy in this air tonight
Do you hear the wind?
The trees whispering their deepest fears to me
They can feel the fire burning at their limbs
Burning at their limbs, burning at their limbs
The voice of anger, it screams in the wind
The voice of anger blows in the wind
Do you hear the sound of the nothing
Of everything tossed by the wind?
The sound of the war drums beating on
In the war for the hearts of every man, of every tongue
I see them coming down on the clouds, the clouds of black
The clouds of war, clouds of war

Cut your wrist on the fins of the fish and drain all you can

Tie 'em up for the fact that I'm kickin' ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out

To commit a crime and go through with it
You know what, no need for shakin', because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearin' a badge, but he's a ol ass man
Pump his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen

Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers can see
And smile, you know, cause I'm controllin' the shit
And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so

Empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny
Takin all you stupid motherfuckers' money
Peepin at a bitch cause my dick's on hard
Laughin at the dumb ass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not sayin' a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin
And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin
Took her to the backroom, about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn"", then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind, was goin' up in her
The suspense was makin' me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn"", dropped the gat from my hand

Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so



Stackin up the money and there's more to collect
Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see

Hurry up and get on
Allright, tell me, who is the motherfuckin alarm?
I'm a give ya a chance, and count to three
Or else five of ya bitches are comin with me

Fuck you! We got hostages, and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sendin out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door



I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin
With screamin hostages, runnin and chokin
Gettin away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range, by a motherfuckin cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work

Got something in my waist that you can't touch either
That's â my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I'm in the club on some gangsta shit

Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club
Ain't nothing but a g-thing, baby it's a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat

Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back

Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass

Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch

Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
Niggas thought I wasn't coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo' with the motherfucking top down
I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre
You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion 'till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down

Tell 'em you came with me

In the V.I.P
It's a new day, and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke

Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back

Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass

Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch

Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath",Hip-Hop
"Freedom rider...though you've tried
Words are not enough for you now...
It's hard on your pride
I can't find you...though I know you
You are just a step out of line...
Come closer to me
When the lines are drawn
And no one comes to break us down
And the walls that stood between us
Tumble to the ground
It's time to find someone to run to
I've got a place in mind
It's known as conscience point
It's where the clouds roll by
They say that nothin' really matters
I'm goin' out to find
Why people come this way
And put the past behind
You know there really is a reason
Changing faces...trading places
Nothing lasts anymore...it's hard when you try
Star-crossed lovers run for cover
I don't know if it's right...but I know how I feel
When you're tired of all those things
You never said before
And although you've tried you never opened that door
It's time to find someone to run to
We'll run the roads tonite
We'll meet at conscience point
I look into your eyes
You say that nothin' really matters
If I could change your mind
If you would look my way
And leave it all behind
You'd know you really mean so much to me
When you've tired of all those things
You've never done before
And you never took the time
To fall in love before
You've got to find someone to...yea
We'll run the roads tonite
We'll meet at conscience point
I'll look into your eyes
And know that somethin' really matters
'cause we can change our minds
And we can find our way
And leave it all behind
'cause you really mean that much to me
Conscience point...take a walk with me
And put it all behind
We'll make some history",Rock

The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them, ""I don't know""

How lonely life has been

But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you loved me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

And once a page is read
All but love is there

There's too many rivers to cross

Stuck in a box of paper wings
Worried about the strangest things

This is the head from which I think
These are the eyes from which I blink
Doing the dance upon the knife
Trying to carve a second life
One with a cherry on the top

I'm fading
And I don't want to go
No, I don't want to go
I've got a gypsy hobo heart
I've always known it from the start
It keeps me wondering what to do
It's going to split me right in two
Can't find the cure in any shop
If I begin I'll never stop
I want to go to Mexico
Find me a beach that no one knows
Ride every wave that comes along
Not ever wonder if it's wrong
All I would need is just a drop
If I begin I'll never stop
But I'm fading
I'm fading
And I don't want to go
No, I don't want to go
Show me the way I feel alone
Hand me the bloody microphone
If this is it I won't complain
From all that I can ascertain
I'd never want to make a swap
If I begin I'll never stop
Know that I love you everyday
Know that I try in my own way
To be the leaf that floats along
To be the maker of the song

"I went too far when I was begging on my knees
Begging for your arms, for you to hold around me
I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
Waiting for your love, waiting for our eyes to meet

Give me some love and hold me tight
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight

When I cut my hands, so you could stand and watch me bleed

Go back in time?

With your questions all alone
But I was too happy driving
And too angry to drive home
I was thinking about the easy courage
Of my distant friends
They said I could let this bridge wash out
And never make amends
Can I blow this small town
Make a big sound
Like the star of a film noir postcard
Can I just forget the frames I shared with you
And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can change my mind
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime
Well there are Spring Street storefront daisies
Floating on their neon stems
There are new shirts on the clothes racks
Should I feel like one of them
I can find a small apartment
Where a struggling artist died
And pretend because I pay the rent
I know that pain inside
Yeah, let's watch the tour bus stop and tell us
Here's the scene of a spring green life dream
Take the best part
Write it in your caffeine diary
And I can't believe what they're saying
They're saying I can leave tonight
Start over on Spring Street
I'm welcome anytime
This year April had a blizzard
Just to show she did not care
And the new dead leaves
They made the trees look like children with gray hair
But I'll push myself up through the dirt
And shake my petals free
I'm resolved to being born
And so resigned to bravery
Yeah the one who leaves this also grieves this
Too much rain on a prairie flood plain
Houses floating, love is like that
We built on the river
And that's to say, yeah I'm leaving

I don't have to go to Spring Street

She fell in love with a dope boy
Until she found out
Dope boys, bitch ass niggas
Scared of the killas
Scared of the riders!

She fell in love with a murderer
I'm a cold blooded killer

You damn right I hit her

So I fuck her like a real nigga

Met her in Miami, I was fuckin' up a check
All black with a strap, I was fuckin' up they set
Fat nigga in the drop so the roof dropped back
Pocket full of guap, tell yo' ex nigga top that
Have you ever had sex in a cherry red Bach?
With a fat trap, nigga get that pussy so wet
Work it out, Bowflex, OG, no stress
Proceed, progress, new house, mo' checks
I know you tired of ya lifestyle
She said she love me cause my life wild
She said she need it right now
Cause what I got can't fit in a Lifestyle
Actavis make her tongue sweet
And going deep make her heart stop
All it take is one call
I'm pullin' up when the call drop


Fuck her like a real nigga
I fuck her like a real nigga
I fuck her like a real nigga
She fuckin' with a real nigga

I met her in Orlando, after the show
I was tryna leave, she told me she tryna go
I was on the pill, she told me she tryna roll
I was tryna fuck so she told me do it slow
Hit her from the back, sippin' Act, blowin' pap
Whenever she leave, tell her lead with the strap
My chopper's in the front, triple beams in the back
Young bitch, gotta teach her how to act, how to trap like
Take that, leave that though, three stacks for the petro
Window down for the jet smoke, I remember riding Metro
Now it's beef steak with the beer shrimp
Heavy butter like a real pimp
She gettin' tired, counting all night
Shopping trips make it alright

"Somewhere between prayer and revolution
Between Jesus and Huey P. Newton
That's where you find Jonny 5 shoot shootin'
Water guns at the audience while ya scootin'
Your glutenous max due to the fact that I'm tootin'
On the horn gonna warn you that I'm rootin'
For the other team in the culture wars
So I stab the beast belly while the vulture snores
Yo Joe!
Let it blow with convulsive force
Till walls fall off their false supports
Till Jericho's aircraft carriers alter course
And all brave young Americans are called ashore
Cause we've already lost the war they keep wagin'
Splattering the streets in battles that keep ragin'
Bloodyin' each page of the story that we're studying
Each day the same just the names keep changin'

Saying the same things over again
Repeatin' the same slogans we don't know where we've been
We've been all over the globe on our government's funds
Leavin' man woman and child dead bloody and numb
Saying the same things over again
Repeatin' the same slogans we don't know where we've been
We've been overthrowing leaders with legitimate views
Democratically elected but we didn't approve
How many times can the line divide
How many wars to uphold your pride
Fears uncontrolled just swoll the tide
Of blood in the streets while the people die
I'ma keep on tryin'
Longs as suffering's multiplyin'
And why not
Souls get tossed and left out to rot
My backs broad enough to help left your cross
As long as you help with mine
The process of healing will take some time
To see the pain on your face is the same as mine
Not a game or a race but the stake is high
We maintain our mistakes for the sake of sides

As long as it takes I'll say it one more time
As long as it takes I'll say it one more time

Free mumia and Leonard peltier
Human needs not corporate greed
Drop the debt and legalize weed
We say yes to grassroots organization
No to neoliberal globalization
Bring the troops back to the USA
And shut down Guantanamo Bay
The same things over again
My throat's so sore from shoutin' no war for the soldiers again
Lookin' for cloud cover when the explosions begin
Lookin' the crowd over wonder if you where we've been
We've been all over the globe Iran to Nicaragua
Guatamala Angola grenada
Dominican republic Haiti chile

"As I walked out in the streets of Laredo,
As I walked out in Laredo one day,
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen,
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.
""Oh beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly;
Sing the Death March as you carry me along.
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me,
I'm a young cowboy and know IÃÂ¯ Â¿ Â½ve done wrong.""
""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by.
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story;
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die!""
""My friends and relations they live in the Nation:
They know not where their dear boy has gone.
I first came to Texas and hired to a ranchman,
Oh I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""
""It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing:
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay.
First to the dram house and then to the card house,
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""
""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song.
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall.""
""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys,
And tell them the story of this my sad fate.
Tell one and the other before they go further,
To stop their wild roving before it's too late.""
""Oh, bury me beside my knife and my shooter,
My spurs on my heels, my rifle by my side.
And over my coffin put a bottle of brandy,
That the cowboys may drink as they carry me along.""
""Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips,"" the poor cowboy then said.
Before I returned his spirit had left him
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead.
We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,
And bitterly wept as we bore him along.
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young, and handsome,
We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.",Country

If I could go back
That's the first thing
I would do I swear that I would
Do my best to folow through
Come up with a master plan
A homerun hit, a winning stand
A gaurantee and not a promise

Then you will have them
If it's the mountains' bending rivers

To get my man's love, aww, yeah
Just makin' it easy for the clean up woman

Was made it easy for the clean up woman

"A strange request followed this call
For the darkening of every light, suffocation of every cry
Bells of death started to play
Depreciation of time, the explanation of lies
Drowning words can't promise delight
The years of secrecy are gone
Trembling hands call for a Lord
The inversion of time, the realization of lies
Burning the shrouds
Of your illuminated souls
It's the embers under our feet
The trails of blood lead me to your shrine
It fades away
Freezing blood under my skin
The futility of efforts, obedience subverts the reason
Words descend into a haze
The inversion of time, depreciation of lies",Rock

a path is marked with the bodies of the unknown, the steel

The clouds grew dense and warned us of another tragedy. Dark is the day
in which you'll meet the boundaries of your conscience.
Our sons are waiting in their cradles tonight.
Somebody tell mine that his father fucking died alone.

Won't renew movement or produce strategies
Opening the data stream

Watched the horizon
Where the last rays got lost!

Started to bask his neck

Wondering he turned
Away from the west

This kid he's not the average
I'm on the rise son like my name was Backstage Laminate
I got a cabinet of members all who posses spectacular vernacular
Blazing through contenders
I remember when hip hop was genuine
When gimmicks were limited
MCs were magnificent
Shows were omnipotent
The crowd was all feelin' it
If a kid had skills on stage yo he'd reveal it
But nowadays mad MCs need lessons in stage presence
Instead of claimin' they represent
While I enterprise, maintain, stay awake and wise

So when I catch wreck to enterprise the land of the sunset
How much run should one don get?

On Sunday or Monday
Whatever day I play at a professional level

Through every ghetto street, backstreet and phat jeep

Paying tribute to the thief who stole away your shadow
You look into the bedrock and listen to the bells

For you found the keyhole, but you lost your backbone
No courage left to join the march of endless time
You saw the sleep of habit on those who walk in trance

You dig holes through the earth to meet the king of worms
To steal away his wisdom and learn to decompose
You chant like fifty Indians, to charm the prince of eagles
To learn the art of seeing and the tongue of the winds
So don't you try to fool me, for I watch your every move
We are kindred spirits, like two voices in the wild

The portal to minds eye, open!

Who it was that pulled the strings
Of those things I saw in dreadful masquerade
Of stark madness went merry round with my head
I passed out, embraced their world
Savoured the poetry of revolt -
Sheer elegy of menace
I have not been the same since,
I took on the profession of a devil
The world I see in a grotesque light
Evil perform with the gestures of a clown
Pure I live in blasphemy
Mephisto I am hidden in Madonnas gown
From the code of common sense I'm free
To bad you are not here to partake my strange horror

In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become a actor or a actress
Or a producer, 'cause you fail to use the
Mic right, so take flight before I bruise ya
For sayin' those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
Hey yo, I'm serious, Big L ain't playin' games
I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin' names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin' platinum and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin' down
Because it should be the other way around

I don't understand it

How MC's take this rap game for granted
MC's, what's goin' on?
I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform
One minute you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for, but not no more
You changed, you rearranged, you're not the same, your raps are blame
That explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Who's fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make fat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack
So MC's, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same and only change with the time
Unless you get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin' for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough, if you're dap, stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin' beeds?

This is how it should be done
I'm not the one, and my raps is strong like gum
But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb
Plus slum, rap skills they have none

And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail
They're forced like fairy tales
Your technique and everything you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black
Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
Your raps border wack, and you went on tour with that
Crap, don't understand it, cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul that Nike Airs, givin' MC's nightmares
Rappers be frontin' hard, and rhymes they don't write theirs
But still call themselves MC's
Please, how could that be?

"My belly is aching and my head feels sore
My eyes are tired and my pocket is poor
Been climbing the mountains
Walking strawberry fields
Swam the lake of fire
Jumped in bins to find my meals
Oh yesterday, who would have thought it would turn out this way
Oh yesterday who would have thought it would turn out
Looking back at the days when I was still at school
I had a view of the world, all I wanted was a boyfriend
Had money in my pocket and a coat on my back
Then the music man came and now theres no turning back
Oh yesterday, who would have thought it would turn out this way
Now Im back on the cigarettes
Been working my fingers down to the bone
Im covered in dirt from the dusty road
And will I ever find a place I can call my own

Boys ain't got no fear,
But did they ever show you how to shut those feelings on then off again

Show you care and you might show the world that you're only gay,
Crying is for babies, for boys is it a sin,
To be a caring, sharing, loving, human one
Handshake show you're friendly, but don't get caught,
You gotta fight to prove you're not afraid, fuck just to prove you're not,

When I bring the stones inside and I lay them on the floor.
I hear the steps from other room Edel's coming from the door. My son is watching me with strange look in his eyes.
His voice starts to chance and my heart turns to ice.

That the blood of our enemies was put in his soul
Now I have found seed of darkness, he is bound
There's no cure for my son or for plague that they have done.
There's no cure.


Listen what your heart will desire.
And protect all the stones from the dark.
You can't fear the unholy fire
Or the evil will know where you are.

Seed of evil has been planted years ago
Before the birth of my man, from darknesses hand.
Just pure evil they infected their souls.
They tainted Amardon, also Delinom.
Evil blood is running through their veins.
Can`t find a cure to remove all these stains.
Those times before the sword, everything was fine.
No one knew about it's source or the power what it causes.
Times when I was God we were safe from the dark.
Now the blood from our enemies is controlling son.

Don't fear the unholy fire
Or the evil will know where you are.

Voice of evil speaking trough my dear son.
Says that,

Your end is near the new king is here

With great powers he strokes me to the floor

No mom why

Now, you must die

Last thing I see he's runnig out from the door
Is this my own blood, I see on the floor?.
Those times before the sword, when everything was fine
No one knew about it's source or the power what it cause.

Where am I going I don't know but something makes me walk.
I should stop but then those voices start to talk.

Years ago, so I've been told
That the blood of our enemies was put in his soul
Now I have found seed of darkness, he is bound
There's no cure for my son or for plague that they have done.

Now all is vanished, the whole universe will be gone.
If we lose the stones this land will be undone.
They can rule the elements fire, earth, wind and ice.
They will destroy everything and we have no chance rise.

For a vote on electionday
Is there no-one left to shout?
There's some people round here need sorting out
'Coz for you there's just no hope
Get a rope, get a rope
Sitting warm and snug on your council seat
In comfy shoes and tweed
With your rules and regs wrapped nice and neat
Deciding what my kids can't read
We're sick and tired of your liberal views
What's politically correct?
Come judgement day, I'll be tying the noose
And slipping it around your neck
Can't you hear me shout?
There are a lot of people like me about
But for you there's just no hope
Get a rope, get a rope
We want to make life one big joyride
But the roadblocks get in the way
We want to fly off the Spanish seaside
But the plane's always delayed
We want to sing songs on radio 1
but the BBC says ""no!""
We want to do deals on a mobile phone
and have something left to show
Is there no-one left to say?
There's some people round here need blowing away

"From somewhere outside, I hear a
Street vendor cry ""filet gumbo""
From my window I see him, going
Down the street and he don't know
That we fell right to sleep
In the damp tangled sheets so soon
After love in the hot afternoon
Now the bourbon street lady,
Sleeps like a baby in the shadows

She was new to me, full of mystery,
But now I know 
That she's just a girl,
And I'm just a guy, in a room
Full of love in the hot afternoon
We got high in the park,
This morning and we sat, without talkin'
Then she came back here,
In the heat of the day, tired of walkin'
Where under her breath,
She hummed to herself a tune
Of love in the hot afternoon",Country

Yellow lines that blend together in my eyes
And when the seasons change again then I will too

There are miles of hay like I have never seen
Just when you think you've had enough and
your dreams come true
I just want to be closer to you
My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Tomorrow I'll be lying under you
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
I know that there might come a day
where my life is through
But I just want to be closer to you
My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Someday we might learn to tell the truth
We might even find the fountains of our youth
We all needed something real we all need proof

"Awaiting my last breath
The mirror calls my name
It's showing me the way
Into the dark
The bridge appears
I jump into the dark side
And hear the voice it's cold as ice
""Welcome to reality""
Where am I now?
Darkness surrounds
Can't go forward
Can't go back
I see planets dying
I fall into the light
A new universe awakes
I'm a Traveler in Time
Pray for the light
Where's the key
To the gate
Of a new life - no
I search for deliverance
But I cannot find

Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
Once I'll be back for a moment in time
That's when the mirror's falling down
Take me away
From the place I've been
To another life
In another world
A sign of life
Surrounds me now
The bridge appears in the dark
I'm free
I fly alone
Leaving the darkness now, forever?
The memories of children
And the wisdom of many lifes
Burns deep in me
Where will the light go to?
Where will the light go to?
Is this deliverance?
Is it the end?

I'm back there's a new chance for me
And all my memories are gone
I can feel what's happening to me
And the mirrow will burst

If you hold on to love too loosely it'll fly away and won't come back
Love has a mind of it's own it'll dance like a kite on a string
For something that can be so strong love is a fragile thing love sure is a fragile thing

That blooms in the month of June.

A trip to France or Spain,
But if I should go ten thousand miles,

Who's a-gonna glove your little hands?
Who's a-gonna kiss your sweet little lips,

Beneath your skin I'm your god

I know that you're a poisonous snake

To commit suicide so you're late

And I'm standing above your bed
I watch your turbid eyes
Where my past's already died

To give light to you
You need to decide what we should do
Look behind my mirror
Tell me what you see
I'm sitting there, crying for me
Feel my hand on our skin?
I try to wash your fingerprint
I seek your weakest, bloody wish
My desires sink
I won't leave you alone
My anger's constantly grown
You're feeding me with your pain
I'll break out from your brain

In your hand
I'm following you
But I hate this road
I feel inside
My cells are you
You become alive
While I die

"Lyrics: Angela Gossow/Michael Amott
Born with eyes
But they are not to see
Living on your knees
Choking on spiritual agony
Follow the traces of blood
Throughout the past centuries
You choose not to see
Bow down and worship me at the alter of shame
You strive for perfection but you don't have the tools
Human weakness embodied
Fodder to fools
Feeding the fear of life it self
Over and over again
And you choose not to see
Bow down and worship me at the alter of shame
So you're the saint and I'm the sinner?
You will never understand
You're the saint and I'm the sinner
No - you will never understand

Well, he was smilin' like a vulture as he rolled up the horticulture
Ignited it, and said, ""I hope the vapors don't insult ya""
What I replied denied, but he mixin weed and hop
His head was noddin' up and down like he agreed a lot
Bored, said, ""We need a plot,"" I comply, ""Let's leave the spot""
Hopped in the Granada, he's impressed by the beat I got
His name is ""hay-zoos"" but his pimp name is ""gee-zus""
Slapped a hoe to pieces with his plastic prosthesis
""Nigga don't you know that I'm your daddy?"" said he
This is true, plus he schooled me for my mackin' degree
""Never plea, try not to flee, make niggaz pee when you stick around""
This man my momma had found taught me to put it down
I press the gas to the ground to show that I'm a hound
Makin' sho' that get rubber sound is heard throughout the town
Thirty years ago, Jesus could pull a hoe quick
But now he 50 and his belly hangs lower than his dick
Philosophy that he spit stuck in my memory chips
And now he puttin' in a disk of Gladys Knight and the Pips
Then that shit starts to skip, he said, ""Somebody musta scratch it""
Put the 40 to his lips and poured the contents down the hatchet
Well since my adolescense, cause of his pimp lessons
smack my woman in the dental just for askin' silly questions
Relationship reduction to either rock the box or suction
Ain't got no close potnahs, socially I cain't function
From the pen he would scribe, on how to survive:
""Don't be Microsoft, be Macintosh with a Hard Drive""
Used to tell me all the time to keep a bitch broke
Did I mention that my momma was his number one hoe?
Clunked the 40 on the flo' and placed his palm on the dash
and wheezed out, ""C'mon man, make this motherfucker mash!""

Sparklin' like sequins on a transvestite at Mardi Gras

When I was five I hopped over them wherever we went to prevent
whatever it was that could break my momma's back
Little did I know that it would roll up in a Cadillac
And matta-fact, she couldn't see him like a cataract
And on the track, she went from beautiful to battleaxe
And back at home, she would cry into her pillow
Vomit in the commode, I was six years old
I would crawl onto her lap and we would hug and hold
She asked me what I thought of Jesus when he broke off some bread
I said, ""He missin' a arm, and he seem like a pee-pee head""
She said, ""Don't cuss,"" and my teeth to go brush
And get ready for bed, and the toilet to flush
With tears in my momma's eyes, I was her everything
Before she went out on the stroll
She'd tuck me into bed and sing:
You're much too beautiful for words 
I see the red and white lights as the ambulance flies
Reminds me of midnight in a dopefiend's eyes
And my 9-year-old self as paramedics leave
Left to ball my eyes out on a neighbor's sleeve
To make illustrations that are clear and clean
I'll take you two hours back before this scene:
Early in the morning when the sun starts to creep
When the birds start to chirp and crackheads go to sleep
Moms was comin' in I heard her keys go clink
Wearin' nothin' but pumps, bikini, and fake mink
Even though she served, for fifty dollars-a-pop
Hardly had enough for rent after Jesus re-copped
That day the landlady got her rent befo' he got his knot
Slammed momma's head against the front bolt lock
Then the pump wit one arm done harm
Reached back and plowed into her head like a farm
Never saw the act, locked in the back, I was cussin'
Heard the blap blap of tewnty headcrack percussion
and body blows, her body froze from bolo's to the spine
I was hysterically cryin', all she could do was whine
She didn't even have the strength to say, ""I love you Boo""
But I said it to her and she knew that I knew
She was dead by the time the ambulance got on the case
But I never will forget the plastic hand stuck in her face
Stop at the intersection to ask Jesus 'bout directions
""S go to Frisco.."" 
Mob a left at MacArthur to continue in flight
Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night
Chorus

The rain dropped giant pearls, God was pissin' on the world
or that old man who was snorin' rolled on over and earled
My temperatyre gayge read ""cold and blistery""
Spinnin' wheels made each piece of asphault history
This was Jesus debut out the penitentiary
Fifteen years, but it seem like a century
See, he went in the pen for some other murder drama
Twelve years old when I wrote him quote I wanna be a pimp comma
You accidentally killed my mom, no playa hation points
You know how bitches act, shit exclamation points
First it was a set up move, then it was the truth
His letters were the only thing I had as a youth
But his lopsided game, see, was really counterfeit
So my little son Dominic thinks that I'm a dick
Cause I was runnin' 'round like a little baby Jesus
To me women had to be saints, hoes, or skeezers
And I don't think that it's gon' end til we make revolution
But who gon' make the shit if we worship prostitution?
Ain't no women finna die for the same ol' conclusion
Put they life on the line so some other pimp could use 'em
Pulled into a vacant lot, the road to recovery
Pulled out my pistol as we brushed against the shrubbery
Jesus said, ""Why the hell you pointin' a gat?""
So I pulled a piece of game I could use out the hat
I said, ""This trip is over, we ain't finna ride on
This is for my mental and my momma that I cried on
Microsoft motherfuckers let bygones be bygones
but since I'm Macintosh, I'ma double click your icons""
He struggled for life, then gave up the fight
Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night

"I got this shorty from Paris
closet straight lavish.
She ain't got a fat ass
but to me she the baddest.
Found her in Soho
a loft party dolo.
Chanel purse and Angie Von G on,
the pants off.
Black MAC on the lipstick.
Vibe was straight mystic.
That accent, it got me.
We spoke in the lobby
bout NY and Paris,
London and Cali.
She been around the world,
I been eyeing that body.
Don't go for diamonds.
I only go for gems.
There's something bout a woman who
got her own plans.
She a stylist so she bout it,
going shopping with ya mans.
And she never stress a nigga
cause she know who I am.
Who I am? The man
with the plug and the plan,
who got a good mind
and is better than your man.
I got this shorty from Paris

Now we movin' 
to the spot .
Round the corner 
up the block .
Stumbled in 
up the stairs 
through the door .
Grab the hand .
Her heels came off
the fur did too.
Now we layin' on the rug
and I'm lookin' at her view.
The whole skyline
right before the sunrise
right before I went in it.
Had her sayin' my god .
I hope this right here lasts long.
Got a tendency to meet a good girl and move on.
I get bored type easy
but it really ain't my fault.
Only 21 is for a million girls in New York.
In New York? I'm sorta like a prince low-key
and she already know that
so she fly in from Paris.
I got this shorty from Paris
closet straight lavish.
She ain't got a fat ass
but to me she the baddest.

There's fight at the heart of a struggle

No more, no more, no more
No more goodbyes
So so long
So so long

Now
No more white lies
You used to be the one true thing in my world
You told me that you loved me
You're in love with yourself
Shoulda listen to my mother
You messed around the others
Now you're dead to me
I've been sleeping with the enemy
Should keep your best friends close by
Should keep your best friends close by
You should keep your best friends close by
But keep your enemies closer
But keep your enemies closer
So many evil talents you juggled
It's fair to say you didn't act subtle
Your smile should've told me you're trouble
No more, no more, no more
Came crashing down I'm staring at rubble
They need to send you into space in a shuttle
Your smile should've told me you're trouble
No more, no more, no more

Strange and deranged
Seek fame was the name of the game
Defeat rivals Abel and Kane
Get trophies they'll look great in a frame
What would you have done, take all the blame?
With your hands held firm over naked flames
Being grilled now you're shaking again
Faking the pain, dark visions of Satan
Contemplating, talking man to man
She was a girl on film Duran Duran
She called me her ape man orang-utan
Me Tarzan, she Jane
Take all the blame I'm the bloke in the chorus
We were sweet once everybody saw us
I ain't flawless still unsure
I loved us but I loved me more
You used to be the one true thing in my world
You told me that you loved me
You're in love with yourself

You messed around the others

"The memory lingers on of the arrival of dawn.
They saw the beacon aflame,
Burning with sorrow for the lives that would be lost.
And the troops went ashore,
Sounds of drums filled the air.
Towards the city they marched.
Called all the young ones, called the old.
Summoned the people to stand up and be bold.
Fight a superior force for high society.
Sheltered behind the walls,
Holding the riches that forever could be lost.
Outside the city gates
The peasant army fights on
Towards their imminent doom.
Cross the Field of Sorrow children's soul still cry
As an echo from the blackened day.
Cross the Field of Sorrow
There are whispers and sighs
From burning anguish and dismay.
From the protection of walls
Beheld the blood stained plains
Reeking of sacrifice's shame.
Children and cripples of the battle that was lost.
Trembling hands open the gates
For the extortion of fire,
As they had nowhere to hide.
Fill up the barrels and chests with all your gold.
Build me a throne to rest upon.
Fear not the fate of the fallen,
Hear not the cries of the crows.
And so they sailed off with the gold.
In the midst of the sea
They were caught by a storm.
Both booty and crew's lying deep.",Metal

Go on and strut your stuff youre fancy.
Red sun setting, smiling moon rising,
You grab the trove and Ill keep the car running
We got a stash out by that pussy willow,
Take out the trash before your folks get home
Shuffle kick up some dust were dancing,
Go on and strut your stuff youre fancy.
Were like animals on fire drunk with love,
Riled up and spitting mad you know thats what were made of

You little squalls are going to be running with my knife out.

I'm doomed to be
The tempter and the secret foe
Cause I am hell and hell is me
Pure hate will grow

We're bound to no law

From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine

Until the end of the world
So just like slaves we may deem him
Dead silence
Until the end of the world

It hurts though
Disburdened spirits we will be
I've learned my lesson
Pure and sore
An offer divine
We're far beneath them
They consider us slaves
They steal our pride
Don't trust them blindly
Cause truth they conceal
As it seems
I'll reign
Cause here in my tower
Impassioned, I'll show you a way

I can feel your hallowed rage
Now enter my realm
Awake and arise, you'll be free

"We're sitting here with Eazy E
Believe that
How are you doing?
All right
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin' , I specialized in gankin
whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangster havin fun)
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin, and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law

Hell no! Just trippin' off eight-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
and if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn
Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?
Wait for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Look then all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shht, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two hundred eleven ?
Yeah
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash

Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
so he came out to test his stamina
against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I ran
back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it""
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me

I don't lie
You see I'm not mister nice guy
Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?
Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my hit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
thought, and damn so what?
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N-W-A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session

No more questions!",Hip-Hop

Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love, how to give just a little
Thank God I'm a country boy

"Lets go climb
And move back time
To that mysterious hill
Where a boy first met his girl
Long before
The cynics arrived
Before the laughter died
And God returned the day to night
Where dazzling fireworks
Rained sparkles
On our lives
Two strange birds
Came together
And opened up their eyes
Lets go climb
Well move back time
Fireworks Hill, Fireworks Hill
Far from my mind
Never forgotten
Fireworks Hill, Fireworks Hill
We became one there
So very often
And there are vivid colors
Blasting through the sky
Dancing rainbows
I really want to taste
There is weeping smoke
Painting all the stars
Burning graveyards
For the human race
Lets go climb
And move back time
To that mysterious hill
Where a boy first met his girl
Well race to the edge
Fulfill our pledge
It was written in blood
The heat of our love
Oh, jump, baby, jump
Well fly away together
Jump, baby, jump
Our bodies joined forever
Lets go climb
And move back time
To that mysterious hill
Where a boy first met his girl
Fireworks hill, fireworks hill
I see the sparkles in the air
Fireworks hill, fireworks hill
I smell the dazzle of your hair
Fireworks hill, Fireworks hill
We flew to Heaven over there
Lets go climb
Well move back time

"When you smile at me
You take me to a world I never thought I'd see
Your eyes can touch my soul
And fill me with a hunger only you can feed
When you smile at me
When you speak my name
Your words of love surround me like a gentle rain
You whisper soft and clear the things I long to hear
It's like an angel's sweet refrain
When you speak my name
There's no love like our love
Our passion knows no end
Together we can soar to heights
That no one's ever known or has ever been
When you kiss me
You fill my mind with dreams of pleasures yet to be
You take me in your arms
And hold me till it's all that I am conscious of, endlessly

I sang your Broadway melodies
Bad harmonies

You picked me off the lawn, I think
And led me to the kitchen sink

As squinting through the dark I saw
You peeling off your teenage bra
The door slightly ajar

You lived just across the hall
For eighteen summers, eighteen falls
Until you went away to that
Weird college in Wisconsin
And where would Willie Mays have been

And you can do anything
This I give to you
May your heart purr like a bumblebee
May all your backyards have a tree
May you always be HIV negative
I hope you meet a nice guy who
Treats women better than I do
I don't even care if he's a Jew or not

I remember in the temple hall

Are these moments that we have, youre all the world to me

Leaving town, the window panes they flash like movie frames, the last scene in a picture show

I have been around the world, theres so much there to see
And the story never ends youre all the world to me

And I don't want to fight with you no more

Feeling on my flow now she really wanna go
Tell her that I love her but she knows it ain't so
Her heart starts racing now she's ready to explode
Ima make her mine by the end of the show

Hook line sinker, got her turn like a blinker
Have her bouncing out her clothes
While I'm jumping out the speaker
Keep it kicking like a sneaker
And she knows I wanna freak her
Baby girl I don't know your name
But I'd really like to meet ya, oh
Let's go on a full speed grind
Keep your two cents
My baby girl's a dime
Fine, mine, and so divine

Got her showing her shine, with her lip gloss on
Melting in my hands while I rip this song
Flip that on, don't get me wrong
Ima hit that shit like all night long

Verse 2:
Jazz it up, shake it out
She got me going crazy when she break it down
That body vibrating when we play it loud
Hat turned back with the A-town down
She's the only one that I see in here
All decked out in the AK gear
I'm like, hey there dear, put your name on here
If the fame ain't clear then the game gon' steer
Pedal to the metal now she's hot as flames
All we really want is some whips and chains
Yo, call her highness, baby's still the finest

With my guidance she could be timeless
So rewind this, study what I'm finding
She gon' want a label that is prolly gonna bind us
All I gotta say is don't try this, flyness

I watched a butterfly go shutter by
Now she's digging in on this gutter guy
And I wonder why she's hooked on me

Groove and sing, just feel the vibe
I'm locked on my red lipped cyanide
Guys have tried, but she shot 'em down
She only looking for that man with the golden crown
She can scan around but she knows I'm down
She can see it in my eyes and the way I sound

You killing it, I'm killing it

Pick up the dreams that were nearly lost

Torn from the calm by a judging hand

Instinctive downfall in the hands of justice
Deny these prayers of the feeble,
This mental hammer of a new abomination

Phantom senses of this stolen purpose
Unknown birth without a reactive sense

Assassins of this justice to be ripped of skin
Self-obsessed moral arrogance
Tyrant goals of these chained ideas
Committing acts of evil for the name of good
Fury that burned like the desert sands

Beckoning this call for murderous change
Burrowing through these layers to the surface
Stolen words that have been forged
From the neglected myths of knowledge
Stench of fear from the living reeks of cowardice
Casting this treason of life
Into the frozen word of loneliness
These conquests of hatred are a testimony
A world in which man spawned
Great praise that beings the rise tragic
Towering the skies in this complete wreckage
Cast into bowels of the abyss
Mankind created for this penance
Corruption lays so close to the voice that forces it
Black bleeding eyes of the pale horse
Entrance into the passage of war
These nails that were forged into the cross
Embracing of thoughts swallowed by the dark
Never kneel before this crucified image, never crawl before these enslaved intentions
These cultural evils are overturned for the rise of resenting wars
Strike out with self loathing infection, denying the cause for this blind redemption
Lying words from broken truths
Extract the resistance of change
Historic beliefs of this leverage
Begin this tragedy of existence
Spoken words of this final stand
Prophets will preach of laws that have damned the birth of man
These fears are entombed in books, that
Portray a tale of this revelation
Seeding the implements of annihilation
These worn analogies of the dying
Strangled thoughts with hell's eternal fire
Handing over the self you deny",Metal

At this dark summer night

Distress of thousand years is heard
Sketching a purple face before me
A hand motions, asking me to come
I'm flying across the end of existence
And lost sight of calm lands

Distress of thousand years is heard
Sketching a purple face before me
In an obscure - blue room

His dead face is the first step

Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue
In my dreams oh I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky in the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Beyond the lane there's another world
Butterflies floating in the air
Is there someone out there for me?
And so life goes on day after day
With knick-knacks on the floor, nooks and crannies
I live in a tiny world
But out there someone waits for me
I wish I had someone to watch over me
In my dreams oh I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky in the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Now I know there's another world
Butterflies floating in the air
There is someone out there for me",Folk

I heard promises become fables forgotten
I saw bridges stretching out across the water

Taller than any borderline
I saw civilizations deemed insignificant
I saw people?s history tattooed upon their skin
I saw families taken from their land
Dynasty shattered and stolen

I asked when is the revolution
And all the burdens the centuries accrue
That get passed along to every generations youth
And all the allegories told in lewd truth

I saw the rise of an untamed industry
And I watched machines print a paper economy
I saw my own self stand right in front of me

And prescription pills mingling in the mezzanine
With a whole wealth of doctors and pharmaceutical companies
Still poor people were dying from disease

And saw looming in the clouds above the Pentagon
As he re-lives the holocaust as strong as the parkin' on
Visions  Vietnam
And I stood silent upon the flooded levee
Stared at the ruins of a merchant city
And the president who came to dine with the noble, he
He didn't do a thing

So to all you bustas out there, beware

Woke up this morning with the thought of robbin' a bank to get rich
Ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit
Fresh out the pen, and I'm low on ends, fuck calm, I tried to stay thug
Got flowin' skills, but niggas, they bitches, now I just can't buy my bud
With my steel, grabbed the forty-four mag plus a sack
And I snag my leather rag, can't reveal when I glide with the moneybag
ride to the hide, count my flags. I be livin' on the darkside
And I can't escape, some say it's a phase
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is if I play with my gauge
It's a raid. Put your face to pave
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets, watches, jewels, and you'll be safe
I snatched the clerk up by her neck, put the gun in her mouth and said
""Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe
if you want to be killed try some stupid shit
And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell""
Trail to the back with the money in the sack
Locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail
Well, tickets I'm out the door
hopped in the smug, and I break fast
Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, loc'd out as I flip through my cash
At last, nigga made good, and I got away smooth
Now, I'm straight. Covered my tracks
Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool
I gotta get mine, and if you stall, then I'm gunnin'
Just work your job, get paid. I'll rob ya
See, a nigga creep on a come up
Stalkin' , walkin' jack moves.

See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down
steady thinkin' 'bout how to get paid
Gotta gauge at my waist that be spellin' out murder
That'll get a nigga locked the cage
Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause
What can I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullshit
But a real lick, like robbin' a jewelery store
Select which one will I raid. Got be headin' downtown
'cause tonight's the night
Dressed in my black, wearin' makeup on my face
so a nigga can't be seen in the spotlight
Stole two cars, and I parked one north
Parked one east for the smooth switch
When a nigga bail, how the fuck he gonna tell if a
nigga don't dwell in the same shit?
Climb to the roof, and I'm peepin' out the scene
And there's no one I can spot, so I get my ass down
Looked around through the window, and I broke the bitch out with a rocl
Now I jump my ass in. Start to fillin' up the bag
And a nigga comin' up on these diamonds
Grabbed a couple herring bones, and some rings
And some , still thinkin' how them diamonds was shining
Went to the cash register, broke the bitch open
Grabbed all the money they had
And a nigga gettin' goin' gone to Bone, yeah
Got to let my niggas check out my bag
And I got away smooth, 'cause I had the shit planned
And ain't no bullshit get brung up
That's what I gotta do if I want to get paid

Feel the murderous nerve
this twelve shot pump, and I gotta bigger gat to back me
Peelin' in my smug, thug, hoody, black skully, black khakis
Creepin' in my smug, so reapin', peek into the window, let me cock this
Nigga must've been meant to be jacked, 'cause here comes me hostage
Up outta the door, with a pump to her temple, shoulda seen her tremble
Push any alarms, and I drop them bombs on moms
It's just that simple. I took my ganjas and fried 'em
Don't gimme no hassle, bitch, 'cause I've been scopin' for weeks
and I know y'all got some shit
Clack back me gun, hollow point mixed with dumb-dumb kickin'
Ladies and babies scream onto the floor
 It's a jack move, fools
Give me the jewels, the dope, the weed, the cheese
and answer me: why and you hoes is cryin', 'cause bitches are dyin'?
Blood clot, here to be dead what one of them niggas said
Buckshots up into them dreads, and I love when I hear them pump red
One that callin' me bluff, I stuffed him with the quickness
He made out with a smooth thirty G's
So all bodies must bleed, I need no witness
So with a me slug, mo thug jumped into him smug, rolled the blunt up
good stuff reefer, hitted the Bone to give up love to my thugs

"Hey little bluebird, how are you?
Is it fun to fly in a sky of blue?
Is it fun to sit and keep an eye on me?
As much as I enjoy to watch you in the summer breeze
Hey little bluebird, why do you stay?
Through all the months of winter and all the snowy days?
Why don 't you fly where the sun is warm for you?
When it's cold outside what do you do?
Chorus: Where have you been?
Where do you go?
Flying in the sun
Flying in the snow
You're so lovely and I'm glad you're here
My little bluebird
Hey little bluebird on my window sill
When the sky is grey, how do you feel?
Are you lonely, do you sing a little song?
Do you ever cry when you're alone?
How high can you fly? Do you ever lose your way?
Where do you hide when you're afraid?
Does your little heart ever break like mine?
Do you have a friend you think about at night?

"I bought a ticket to Austrailia, for my holidays,
Got my boarding pass, found out at last,
That I was seated in the middle of the row.
The buisness man beside me smelled like Old Spice, and Gin.
The lady to my left was talkin bout her grandchildren.
Two kids behind me were screamin for their mum.
She was screamin back,
""Wonder how come?""
I got the worst seat on the plane,
By the time I land I'll be insane.
My legs are startin to go numb, and,
I just wanna kill someone.
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Bladders full, my back's a pain,
Next time I have somewhere to go,
Think I'll ride my bicycle.
I can't go to sleep, 'cause the pillow's too damn awkward,
So I try to watch the movie, but it starred Kevin Costner.
Earphones hurt my head, and the reading lamp was dead,
Then the pilot said ""Turbulence is on the way.""
My food try was now on my lap,
The old lady beside me had a heart attack,
Children screamed so loud I thought my skull would crack,
Buisness man turned blue, blew up on my back!
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Time I land I'll be insane,
My legs are startin to go numb, and,
I just wanna kill someone!
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Bladders full, my back's a pain
Next time I have somewhere to go,
Think I'll just rent the video!
After seven hours I can take no more.
So I try to open the Emergency door,
But the flight attendant, tackled me to the floor,
She said ""Go back to your seat dear.""
I said ""I'd rather get off here.""
I got the worst seat on the plane,
I think I am now insane,
My legs are both completely numb, and,
I want to kill everyone!
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Bladder's full, my back's a pain.
The next time I get Wonderlust,
I think that I'll just take the bus.
I got the worst seat on the plane,

"Outside with the cuties
I don't think the woods are too deep
The grass covers the sand
All the wood is damp
Feeling very touched
'Cause my friends are in love.
Feeling pretty far from home now
So I sit to write this down
I guess it's not really brave
I know I'm not a lake.
I haven't written this part yet
Will you help me write it?
You are bug bites on vacation
You find the sad in everything
Can't see you cry

You move towards me and I love you
I love you

And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason, has no rhyme

Love is a drowning soul

"A psychic said to me - 
She said, ""You know I gotta a very special feeling,
That truth and freedom will break out today!""

""Cause there's a message in the cards- it reads:
Today's the day to break the fuckin' mold!
SMASH IT TO PIECES,
while singing 1,2... 1,2,3,4...""
Paper to pen; yeah smash it all to pieces
Become a vehicle that blossoms thruth and freedom
Every city, every street, every town-
new pulse; heartbeat!
A vision came to me - 
Not in a dream while sitting at the subway station
Waiting for the train to take me away

It might have been an angel or a ghost -
I don't know?
But its message came through
shining crystal clear:
""SMASH IT TO PIECES,
while singing 1,2... 1,2,3,4...""
There's not a name you can assign it
More than a movement
it's the fabric that makes up a human being
There's nothing stupid but love,
caring, peace instead of guns
So now we've got to
take to that message to the streets!
Through our art, through our hard work,
get on your feet!",R&B

Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange Fruit

Dance little brother, dont give up the fight
Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up today
Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate

Black bodies on the wall, color from years ago
It's spiritual the way that them tears they fell slow
Roots and bruises so deep, found it hard to sleep
Souls lost in the heat, pray to God to keep
Fast forward to my pop, he nod and geeked-off the Heron
Still he was dead to bear arms
Thats where I'm from, my story ain't that different from yours
A blood line, a hard time, prisons and wars
With struggle it came rain, when it rains it pours
We stayed between liquor stores, and ""praise the Lord""
Singing ""we shall overcome"" cause we came for more
We were dancing for it to rain no more
Though hurricanes and waves they came ashore
Takin' lives of the brave and poor
They'd ignore, us once again
But it was lessons in the wind
Of change that came from within
So...


Wonder if I make it to heaven, will I get a chance to party
And celebrate with the great black bodies
Im talking bout Marley, Nina, and Marcus Garvey
Similair to Africa the streets is our safari
From shanties in slums, is children with guns
AIDS and poverty killing our young
Gramps keep sayin a savior gon' come
For the meek and the humble favor gon' come
From the same trees we were hung, we can see the sun
In the darkest hour, our power begun
I write from the same place they were bleedin' from
I'm emceein they done until the streets is won
So far we've come, with so far to go
To do the impossible only God will know-how we do it
I speak it and I put it in the music
The struggle lives through it, its a movement so move it

Dance little brother, dont give up the fight
Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate
Celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate
Oooooo you got to
Dance little brother, dont give up the fight.

"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured, as it was, by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence that was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them
They only saw shadows you see, without the truth to the eyes
The happy folk were blind
Falling out of airplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead
In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
It's rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the strange folk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain
Holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the monkey would stir from it's deep sleep
Then there came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany so immense
That it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then
Nothing

There's nothing you believe you want

Did you call me out?",Rock

The snake is waiting anytime to penetrate your mind
Don't you hear voices whispering, incline to walk down
Don't you see the shadow on the wall, angel eyes... the one cast out to fall
Calling me to look up to the sky we follow but we never know oh why
A vision revealing a child down where I've sure never been
An angel who's touching the flame, oh the angel is me

Nailed, nailed to the wheel - Nailed, I said go - let bleed! - Go, - let bleed!

Welcome as the poison for the cornered snake
Taste of sin, bitter sweet, never, never let us go
But never, never, never is a price we'd pay to grow
They call it original sin, some call it divine
The moment the evil appeared... the chance to decide

From children in cradles to hangmen who smile

Like Nas, I'm Ill Will with myself
And I can feel the pain of Ms. Wallace
I wish Chris was here, so he could see C.J. blow
Like the paint on this Impala
Tell Afeni to holla if she need another son that rap
Pac's revengeAnd I got a gun that clap like Dr. Dre snares
Blow chronic like Dr. Dre cares
I been there, done that Dr. Dre shares all his bitches and his liquor
He ain't call me for Detox, but that's my nigga
Remember Who Brought Em Back To Compton
nd 23 year Old Me was a fuckin Monsters
Still Niggas Say i Aint Hood what Fuck They Taking Bout
Like I want Kiss My Son on the Head nd Chuck em out
What up 50? Let's talk it out/But until we talk it out

Don't Don't End Up dead
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead

I remember when my older brother wanted to be Rakim
Now I'm livin' his dream, cause somebody shot him
And left me like Eric B. without Rakim
Still payed them for like B.B.S stock Rims
Now I Got California locked In
Dip in this Beamer,Same model, different year they shot Pac in
So whats The Top 10 If You Dead
Who Drop This Lamborghini If Im In the feds
To Times Feeling spelling my Nights Up In The Bed
But I'm From Compton so When Im Out Its Infrared
Get My Son ready For School nd I kiss His Heads
So When You See My Face In The Mirror
If i End Up Dead Bed
Never War Bullet Proof Vest and No Got Bullet Proof Car
You Know Me Westside Triple O.G
And I'ma tell you like the homie Snoop Dogg told me

Don't Don't End Up dead

"Keep the fire burning in your eyes
Pay attention to the open sky
You'll never know what will be coming down
I don't remember losing track of you
You're always dancing in and out of view
I must have thought you would always be around
Always keeping things real by playing the clown
Now you're nowhere to be found
I don't know what happens when people die
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try
It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear
But I can't sing, I can't help listening
I can't help feeling stupid standing around
Crying is the easier down
'Cause I know that you would rather we'd be dancing
Dancing our sorrow away
No matter what fate throws in your way
Just do the steps that you've been shown
By everyone you've ever known
Until the dance becomes your very own
No matter how close to yours
Another's steps have grown
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone
Keep a fire for the human race
Let your prayers go drifting into space
You'll never know what will be coming down
Perhaps a better world is drawing near
Just as easy it could all disappear
Along with whatever meaning you might have found
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around
Go on and make a joyful sound
Into a dancer you have grown
From a seed somebody else has thrown
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own
And somewhere between the time you arrive
The time you go may lie a reason you were alive
But you'll never know",Country
"So I send an SOS
Semaphore myself
Catch me falling finally
Through the air and underground
Everywhere this sound
Screams whisper ""I can't breathe""
I feel it in my bones
Though I know I'm not alone
You're spinning far too far from me
So cruel to be so kind
Now I know I'll always find
This island earth
A mystery
As I stumble through the dark
Dream lovers dream apart
Starry eyed a vision rushes in
Do I wonder or care
My spirit's bleeding god knows where
A never ending stream
I tried to love, tried to find
My soul in shadows running blind
And restless as the sea
Via sidewalks through the haze
Wandering as in a maze
Lost in number time and space
So near and yet so far
Castaway as strangers are
This island earth
And you and me",Rock

If I'm deserting you, I don't mean to make you cry

Although my heart says
How do you tell the one
You love goodbye for good
Or even know if you should
And how do you say the words
You thought you never could
When you promised her
That you love was true
Said I'd never think of leaving you
Oh how can love be cruel

And when it's too late my darling you will wish you had not said goodbye
So be sure to your heart you're not lying be sure you don't still love me yet
It's easy to find a new love but an old love it's hard to forget
So dear take this thought along with you wherever you happen to be
Your lips may be true to another but your heart will be crying for me
Cause you won't ever forget me...",Country

"A miner was leaving his home for his work
When he heard his little child scream.
He went to the side of the little girl's bed;
She said, ""Daddy, I've had such a dream!""
""Please, daddy, don't go to the mines today,
For dreams have so often come true.
My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,
For I never could live without you.""
Then smiling and stroking the little girl's face,
He was turning away from her side.
But she threw her small arms around daddy's neck;
She gave him a kiss and then cried:
""Oh, I dreamed that the mines were all flaming with fire,
And the men all fought for their lives.
Just then the scene changed, and the mouth of the mines
Was covered with sweethearts and wives.""
""Oh, daddy, don't go to the mines today,
For dreams have so often come true.
My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,
For I never could live without you.""
""Go down to the village and tell your dear friends
That as sure as the bright stars do shine,
There is something that's going to happen today;
Please, daddy, don't go to the mines.""
""Oh, daddy, don't work in the mines today,
For dreams have so often come true.
My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,
For I never could live without you.""",Country

Your coming should be just like mine nothing should be left out
There'd be so nuch of happness from inside your very soul would shout

It's good crack its back2back
Knocking out the flavours
Of the penny arcade
Back2back style

A light shown in the night some way ahead, thenblue turned into green then it was red
And light shone in the night as loud music played, the light that shone in the night was a penny arcade

Step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round the penny arcade

Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle that'll make all the colored lights cascade
And music played in the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all the time
Roll up and spend your last dime
At first I thought it was a dream that I was in, lost, lost in a sea of glass and tin
But no that was not to be, dipped my hand in my jeans. I grabbed a handful of coins to feed the machines

Bread and water..This what it comes down to

I remember when these kids got killed up in Pearl
Is it the end of the world? Grown men acting like bitches
Bitches actin' like men, and it's all good
As long as all these records keep sellin'
Niggaz time cut so these snitches keep tellin'
Y'all know it ain't right..
And I ain't bending for these hoes
Is this the part when my God comes back and starts throwin' elbows?
Man these children gone astray, and no daddies in the home
So they turn to gun play, or they just turn gay
Half-bit like they rich broke, niggaz swisha sweet
So I sit, in a lac and just smoke,stayin' down in the street
Vernon Dixon? Georgetown in the hills
The subs and the boys in Hattiesburg so trill
The delta and coast, the queens is what I boast
But these kids in the south is what a nigga love the most

Damn, the kids is what a nigga loves most
Fuck, so trill..

I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill 
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill 

I remember when the twin towers fell
Did the boys in the G know, or just didn't tell?
I ain't forgot about Gore, and them trick ass ballots
Numbers tossed around in the mix like a salad
Or a bird in the Bush
Or a brother up in office tryna give a big push
Y'all don't try to praise God now
He been watchin from the jump, I'ma crunk
Quick to pull the sawed pump, skull and bones y'all can kill me
I'ma G, and the world is gon' feel me
Bet you neva thought the truth would come straight from the middle of Mississippi
So P-Boy keep pushin'..
We some big ones,life would street, man we all on a mission

I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill 
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill 

This for my boys in the pen and my thugs on the county farms
If it's war then I swear I'm gonna raise them arms
And come and getcha, send me a kite...
And I promise that I'll write ya back or smoke a fat sack in ya name
I ain't no bitch or no hoe or no trick
Tryna ride a nigga dick just to make a quick hit
I ain't writin' love songs for prissy bitches
I make songs for the queens who lost sight in the hood
Mayne I made some bullshit but it's good
And if ya see me then you see this shit across my chest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest

I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill 
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'

"I keep tellin' myself that it'll be fine
You can't make everybody happy all of the time
I found myself in a place that I never been
A place that I thought that I would never be
There's people looking back at me
I keep having this dream; I'm at a party
There's people throwing drinks and screaming telling me that I don't belong
Lately life's been the same I find this comfortable place
With all my friends then my friends start telling me that I've always been wrong
And I'm so tired of being wrong
There was a time I could move there was a time I could breathe
The crowded spaces filled with angry faces
It didn't once cross my mind
With paranoia on my heels; Will you love me still
when we awake and you find that the sanity has gone from my eyes?
I got secrets from you, you got secrets from me
Because you're so worried about what I'm gonna to think,
Baby I'm worried too
But if love is a game, girl, then you're gonna win
I'll spend the rest of my life bringing victory in
If you want me to",Country

I got the key to the powerhouse
I got the key, you can't lock me out
C'mon baby we can work out--work out--work
Cold steel rollin' down the track--big wheel gonna break your back

Take me closer baby--don't you wait

"
I have 45 second to show you,
How your heart was torn by
Disilusions, trapped by all the whims
That you created, shaking with a
Fear...
Give way to the sun, it will remind
You there are better days,
When you'll be smiling.	stop this
Apathy before it swallows us!
Am I just the same?
We need empathy

We need empathy

We need empathy

Give me anything
However small!

"Scream lost in dry, salty lake
Crystals of sult glitter
The sand is moist and hot
Like human sight calling for help
Before their boats got on the dry place
Dying vicinity and country
Where human's life lost the sense long time ago
Last scream
If there were any trees
Maybe it'd knock off and return to an old-man mouth
Who's leaving
Perhaps dying just like the lake
Imprints of dead fish in salt you walk on
Surely it burnts with the blood of cracked soles
The scream left lost long time ago
With the last drop
Salty like a tear",Metal

Let me in your life.
I wasn't there when he hurt you, so why should I
Have to pay, let me in your life.
I want to share your tomorrows, so I must beg you
Today, if he's the cause of your sorrows, be glad
That he's gone away.
I need someone, let me love you, please don't push
Me away, Let me in your life.

"When sadness fills your heart
And sorrow hides the longing to be free
When things go wrong each day
You fix your mind to 'scape your misery
Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To a needle of death
How strange, your happy words
Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone
How tears have filled the eyes
Of friends that you once had walked among
Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To a needle of death
One grain of pure white snow
Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain
In peace your mind withdraws
Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain
Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To a needle of death
Your mother stands a'cryin'
While to the earth your body's slowly cast
Your father stands in silence
Caressing every young dream of the past
Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To a needle of death
Through ages, man's desires
To free his mind, to release his very soul
Has proved to all who live
That death itself is freedom for evermore
And your troubled young life
Will make you turn
To a needle of death",Folk

I just wanna stay right here

For you to come back to me
Won't somebody tell me please
When will I get through this pain?
Things the same won't be the same
Until you come back to me

They think I'm always the one so in control

Walking over lames, they can clearly play the carpet,
Hot shit, arson, murder scene caution,
They dont want it with the kid, gladly get abortion,
See you niggas pocket watching, you wont get a portion,
Think im really slippin tho, bullets to yo organ,
Yea you niggas supa ducks yea I'm talkin oregon,
Ride the beat no choruses, like I'm in some foreign shit,
Kayko told me murder dat, so I went and bodied this,
Ballin like I'm by the rim, I deserve a scholarship,
This is where im at today, you should come and follow him,
I be on my planet tho, come and see my mother ship,
F-ck the game and let it go, there is no more sportsmanship,
3 years with that We The Best, sorry I dont see the rest,

From high hopes to the ground
While trouble sings along

A giant in the room

From high hopes to the ground
There's no way out

Though you took her for a fool

Frozen under you

"Let me tell you about Colleen
My best friend since I was three
She always had a taste for dangerous things
Her scandalous tongue was extreme
I was always the one left holding the bag
Smiling and covering her tracks
Best friends, they always do that
She was the first to smoke a cigarette
She once let me watch her make love
It was the kind of balance made by kings
She took it all, but left me some
I guess I always thought she'd have my back
But it didn't work out like that
The moment I laid eyes on Jack

It was my time, it was my space
It was the bright red he brought to my face
Every underdog has their day
Sorry it hurts
But Colleen I saw him first
It all happened on a Thursday
He backed his car right into mine 
""There are no accidents"", my mother told me once
My heart agreed with her this time
Colleen jumped out of the car, screaming
""What have you done?!""
Jack offered apologies
I just got weak in the knees

The minute that your in it
You know there's no turning back
Like me and my Jack
A funny thing
To feel the weight of the pendulum swing
When it starts to swing
Colleen armed with charm and body
Still couldn't take away my man
Last I heard, She was in rehab
I guess that scale got outta hand
Covered from head to toe in colored tattoos
Searching for higher views

He was a man who said our love would never end

One of us would always come around
And try to share some other happiness we found

And I guess I should have known there wasn't love enough for three

And to keep it real, your body's drivin' me crazy
Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby
She could tell it by the look in my eyes
All a nigga ever do is get high
Countin' money with my niggas, stay fly
Run the game, my niggas bang, that's no lie
Just let me roll somethin' up and get high with me baby
Ayy, you're a star, you're so fly to me baby
And to keep it real, your body's drivin' me crazy
Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby

And you know how the set roll, landed where the jet go
She can't ever let go, cause I give her bank rolls
Cross him, break his ankles, what the fuck he think?
I pull up like what it ain't though, tell me what it is
Niggas talking 'bout where I can't go, tell me where it is
Got the drop on where he stay though, I know where he lives
Niggas thinkin' I'm a game though, so quck to let it rip
Talkin' way before the fame, need a gun, I'll move their hit
Niggas actin' like some babies, swear them boys my kids
'Member days was in the trap house, runnin' thru them bricks
Never have to see 'em drizzy, was taught to water whip
Never have to see 'em drizzy, was taught to water whip

Just let me roll somethin' up and get high with me baby
Ayy, you're a star, you're so fly to me baby
And to keep it real, your body's drivin' me crazy
Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby
She could tell it by the look in my eyes

Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby

I know you can see the look in my eye
I been gettin' high but somebody took my light
I been on some other shit, tell them come and wipe me down
Remember all them old bitches hatin', bet they like me now
Just walked in like I hopped up out the arena
Fist full of money like power to the people
Shot gun, shawty, feel the power of that reefer
Girl I'm hosting for the night, it's an hour 'til we leaving
Said keep it rollin' up, pourin' up
You say you need a shot, baby girl load it up
I swear the way we goin' up, they notice us
I know that all you lookin' for, baby, is for the love",Hip-Hop
"Yeah.. Oh yeah.. woah oh..
Sittin' here just thinkin' bout this situation
That's why I'm sending you a 2-way now
We gotta few things we need to figure out
Memories of the night we kissed
Now it seems like we don't exist
You change your mind about a thousand times
Girl I know you're kind
But that ain't right
Now when we're alone and I'm kissing you
There's no place that I'd rather be
Baby believe I'm so into you
But I'm so confused 'cause...

You say STOP when you really mean GO
You tell me YES when you really mean NO
If I'm not what you want baby that's alright
Just stop giving me the green light
Spending hours at a time talking on the phone
Telling me that maybe I could be the one
Girl, you're leading me on and it just ain't right
So stop giving me the green light
You tell me that I'm trippin' and over-reacting
And boy you need to settle down,
stop making this bigger than it is right now
If I'm wrong well then tell me why
If I'm not look me in my eyes
Like the way you always change
Get around your ??? then forget my name
Don't mis-understand
I'm not saying that I'm ready for this thing to end
Make up your mind, are we more than friends?
And I'm out on a limb 'cause...

You tell me yes when you mean no

"
Man you should have seen me way back then
I could tell a tale, I could make a spin
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night
Not only that I could tell you why
Back then I could really tel a lie
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick
I was takin' everything they had to give
It wasn't all that bad a way to live
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell
But no one's buyin' what I got to sell
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day
But everyone just turns and walks away
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time
So I head across the road to drink some wine
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street
You're pretty good if I do say myself
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin' else
Instead of callin' out for fire from above
He just gets real quiet and talks about love
And I'll tell you somethin' funny He didn't want nobody's money
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means
But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen
Well since that time every town is the same
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him
He has everyone convinced that he's for real
Well I figure we can work us out a deal
So he offers me a job and I say fine
He says I'll get paid off on down the line
Well I guess I'll string along Don't see how too much can go wrong
As long as he pays my way I guess I'll follow
We're headed for Jerusalem tomorrow",Country
"
Hold me, love me, give me all that you got
Tell me, truly, can I get in the right spot
For so long, I've waited, for you to come and love me
Don't waste my time, 'cause I need you
To let me know if you want me too
Do the things to you , that no other can do
 I want you bad and I won't lie
And I can't deny that I want you tonight

I wonder what is it that turns me on
When I'm next to you
Can't figure out why I want you
Is it lust or love, either one will do
'Cause I want you for myself, and nobody else
 of you right now
'Cause it is on, so unplug the phone
'Cause I want you to hold me

Oh baby, drive me crazy, put your arms, round me baby
And hold me now, that's what I want to do
Right now baby, I want you to hold me

While cowboys were singing and playing guitars

And I don't want to lay me down to fall in endless sleep
I'm drying all my tears; I try to wipe away my sorrows and grief
Right now I'm walking to the land where I find the words that I can receive,
To a place where I can give and understand and forgive and forget
But I'm walking to nowhere, 'cos a place like that doesn't exist
Tell me why do I pray to the lord?
There is no beauty and passion in this world;
Why do I love you, why do I believe,
Why can't I go or slowly disappear?
Now I reached the point where I say I don't care anymore,
I'm sure I'll never find all the things I was looking for,

There are signs everywhere in the universe

Burned for the knowledge and truth
Believe and trust that's what a man keeps alive

Questions need answers like the desert needs rain

I came and I was bored of it soon after
But I had nowhere to go and so I stayed
I dreamed a lifetime of this place
It seemed an awful thing to waste
Well the morning fills my mouth up with decay
I like it, it reminds me how you taste
Sometimes I feel you rising up behind me like the wind
But I still try to look away
What will you look like when you're old?

What will I do if I don't know you?

I guess that I decided not to ask the day I took the road
Down to the city as it called
Sun making silhouettes of gauze
I don't remember you at all
The city called me and I came
It isn't mine to question why
Sometimes the clouds will rise ahead, I hear your name
It's like a choir in the sky
What will you look like when you're old?

What will I do if I don't know you?

I guess that I decided not to know the day I took the road
Down to the city as it called
Sun making silhouettes of gauze
I don't remember you at all
They pulled a human from my waist
It had your mouth, it had your face
I would have kept it if I'd stayed.",Indie
"It's on a Clancy Brothers CD ""Live with Robby O'Connel"" or somesuch. The
song is called ""Dear Boss.""
Dear Boss I write this note to you to tell you of my plight
And at the time of writing I am not a pretty sight
Me body is all black and blue and me face a deadly gray
And I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today
I was workin' on the 14th floor; some bricks I had to clear
And throwin' 'em down from such a height was not a good idea
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he bein' an awful sod
And he said I'd have to take them down the ladder in me hod
Now shiftin' all those bricks by hand it seemed so awful slow
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below
But in my haste to do the job I was too blind to see
That a barrel full of buildin' bricks was heaveier than me
Now when I came down I cut the rope and the barrel fell like lead
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead
I shot up like a rocket and to my dismay I found
That halfways up I met the bloody barrel comin' down
Now the barrel broke me shoulder as to the ground it sped
And when I reached the top I struck the pulley with me head
I still clung on though numbed and shocked from this almighty blow
And the barrel spilled out half the bricks 14 floors below
Now when the bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor
I then outweighed the barrel and I started down once more
Still clinging tightly to the rope I headed for the ground
And I fell among the broken bricks that were all scatter'd 'round
As I lay there moaning on the floor sure I thought I'd passed the worst
Then the barrel struck the pulley wheel and didn't the bottom burst
A shower of bricks came down on me sure I haven't got a hope
And as I was losing consciousness... I let go the bloody rope
Now the barrel it being heavier it started down once more
And it landed right across me as I lay there on the floor
I broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say
That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today",Folk

when he comes in I will have to fall unto the floor

I saw fire over the forbidden mountain
now I cannot live like I have lived before
I saw honey dripping from the singing fingers
now forever I will be singing so
So are you a body in the darkness of the earth
were there any kindnesses to help you at the birth
if images are second he must be the third
if your word returns to you it must have been heard
I saw fire over the forbidden mountain
now I cannot live like I have lived before
I saw honey dripping from the singing fingers
now forever I will be singing so
I hear the sound from across the sea
I hear the cry from beyond the hill
is it also inside me?
I hear the noise from the battlefield

And when it gets hard
I still retain my faith
The harder the trials come
I still get on my knees and pray
And say thank you
I know the road will get rough
The sea will get stormy
But if I keep my eyes on you
I know you've prepared a place for me
And your word says it's true
And when I get there
All of my burdens
I can't wait to lay them down
My savior
Can't wait to see you in that sweet old by and by
Oh
The clock is tickin'
We're runnin' out of time
What I've been livin' for
Is finally about to be mine
That's why I'm gonna be everything you want me to be
Don't take your love from me
Everyday every night
That's why I'm livin' to see your face
You're the one
You're my life and I can't replace
That's why I've got to be everything you want me to be
Don't take your love from me
And do gonna do what I have to do
To make it through
I don't wanna be left down here
When you go
Clock is tickin'
We're runnin' out of time
What I've been livin' for
Is finally about to be mine
That's why I'm gonna be everything you want me to be
Don't take your love from me
Everyday every night
That's why I'm livin' to see your face
You're the one
You're my life and I can't replace
That's why I've got to be everything you want me to be

"If I could paint pictures I'd paint one for you
A picture portraying the love we once knew
Then a tear would reveal the sorrow in me
As I painted white fences and evergreen trees
Love can be greater than the mountains or seas
But it's only as great as two hearts believe
Faith blew away in yesterdays breeze
And we lost our white fences and evergreen trees

I've walked through a valley and cried all night long
In search for the reason why true love goes wrong
With a prayer on my lips the earth touching my knees
I prayed for white fences and evergreen trees
Love can be greater...",Country

"You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me straight up
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly bitch, you don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind

I think about the girl all the time 
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win
 - I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

 - Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo, that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on playette
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey

Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfucking thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I predicted so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is born, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I'll be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity


Yeah, Come on
Jackie in full effect
Lisa in full effect
Nicky in full effect
Tomeka in full effect
Ladies in full effect
Ain't nothing goin' on but the rent
Yeah play on playette

Paint one heart that's been untrue
Paint one soul make it blue

There are somethings that look so familiar
Strange what this resemblance can be
And now as I look in the mirror
I know, I know the fool you are painting is me
Paint one fool let it talk
Paint two hand that once held it all
And you've painted a portrait of a fool",Rock
"I remember days on Crenshaw, take a nigga Beamer
Hit the hood, take his rims off
Then hit that block, let him hear that Pac
That shit don't stop
Soo woo, new coupe, through the west side
New Benz, top down, new rims, new bitch throwin' up P's, whoo whoop
Compton niggas ain't never gon' be the same
It's in my blood, you see my veins
You see my tats, you feel my pain
You in my hood? You from a gang
You got 2 seconds to answer where you from, or you gon' see your brains
Now that you slumped I see your change
Nigga we got canals, shelves, niggas that tried, niggas that died
Niggas that fell well, off in their jail cell
Shit, we got niggas with full clips
That'll dip through you set and disappear like ""Hell Rell""
No bail like the peace price
Get caught up in the middle of the street at the light, you fuckin' bean pie
Middle of your forehead nigga, that's where the beam lie
 Cause I done seen God
Niggas sellin' crack, Dre sellin' headphones
2Pac in heaven, bumpin' Biggie ""Dead Wrong""
Cherry red Impala, Bobble head red bone
I just killed a nigga on my cellphone
Puff sellin' vodka, weed got my head gone
G-Man in heaven, name on that headstone
LJ in prison, and my nigga Legs gone
I just killed a nigga on my cellphone
Stop that
Playin' chronic, blazin' chronic with the windows tinted
Cause those that don't cut the checks, the ones in yo' business
Rappers sendin' death threats but still ain't sent no killers
You take a stretch away squeeze myself, can't depend on niggas
Shit on niggas check the urinal and you'll see
That I be droppin' jewels and you should take 'em like a jewel thief
Wolves teeth is what I use to eat my fuckin' pray up with
Used to make the yayo flip now Game told me to lay your hits
Teamed up, toured the US just to let the name ring
Goin' home to fuck shit up, I did the King James thing
Steak and lobster with the gentleman, sit with a gangster posture
Blowin' all these bands fans, screamin' like it's Frank Sinatra
Made it out the South Bay village homies hate I prosper
But I don't owe you niggas shit, I'm supposed to thank my mama
Only chase for commas, got 'em in now raise the Llama
Hotter than a blazin' comet, fuckin' south central moth

"I am human, I am changing
I'm growing further from myself
And above all else I find I am grateful
To the one who gave its place
The one who gave its name
To the one who had no choice of living or dying
And now I am convinced that life is a gift
But I'm haunted by the voices that say...
Get up, get up, get up...do something
Get up, get up, get up, get up...do something
Now I wasn't here before anyone, anyone
You'll disappear once see what you have become
Distance is faith, and it shines like a star
That you see in the day because it hurts in your heart
Now this isn't right, yes I know it's not natural
You want to help me because I'm a disaster
The feeling is mutual, I'll agree
Driving you safely away from me
Oh, I am human
The change is coming and I keep on running
I am human
The change it's coming and I keep on running
So you say what you wanted to say
And do as you wanted to do
Pray as I know that you pray
Let the distance sink in you
Could you know where I was from the game?
Heaven does not descend
You will know yourself
Now I am human
The change is coming and I keep on running
I am human
The change it's coming and I keep on running
All I want waits in windows
Where nothing falls apart, enough
And it goes on and on
Braving darkness
Where nothing's what it seems, enough",Indie
"My eyes are perfect but now I see I'm blind
Because I didn't notice all those danger signs
I tried and tried to tell you oh so many times
You should reach for your baby but I reached for the wine
Remember I told you that someday you would find
Just you and your bottle at the end of the line
You'd still be here in my arms and not just on my mind
If you'd reach for your baby like I reached for the wine
If I could reach you just one more time
I'd show you I love you much more than the wine
Many nights my pillow feels these arms of mine
For they couldn't reach you cause I reached for the wine

I'm sure you'll find someone who will be kind and true
That's the things I wanted but I wanted them from you
Our love could have lasted until the end of time
If I'd reach for you baby like I reached for the wine
If I could reach you...

"Mind made up, I'd given all for you
See'est la folie d'amour
By now my mind is clear
You planted all the fear
Doubts and despair and
You keep my heart on the run
I'm bound to fall in love with the one
Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi
So we planed a secret rendez-vous
Toute la nuit chez moi
Soon confusion grew
I sadly smiled for two
His head went down
He wore my heart like a crown
Ever since I fall for the one
Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi
Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi

"You said you liked me at a party
I said oh well um
Your flatmate was drinking whiskey
You asked me to get you some
I stole your key from your apartment
So you'd have to come around
Stuffed balls of cotton to my sneakers
So I wouldn't make a sound
I disconnected the gas heating
Then suggested movie nights
It got colder, you moved closer
So I cooked us Party Pie
And I did everything to not let you know I liked you
And everything to let you know that I was still around
Like swapping chairs and coughing loudly
Putting on your favorite songs
Standing hidden in the pantry
Hoping you would come along
Like tracing lines into a napkin
To the shadows of your face
Like dropping you to choir practice
On my U12 study break
And I did everything to not let you know I liked you
And everything to let you know that I was still around
Outside the party it was raining
You were hailing me a cab
I had a plane at seven-thirty
Rain was dripping down my back
I'm pretty sure you said you liked me
But a bottle smashed somewhere
You lent me your road map of Melbourne
I pretended not to care
And I can't stop thinking about what would have happened
If I hadn't gone to Melbourne and gone out to your party
Even though you didn't want me to
I just want you to know
There's still a spot left on my key ring
Just for you",Indie
"When I took my boat out to the White Sea
I had no care in the world
Not a cloud disturbed the sky
I was dreaming only of how it might be
Then dark fell into the day
And the wind began to rise
Peter on the White Sea
Green mountains of waves
Blew all around
Peter on the White Sea
The howl of the wind, that lonesome sound
Sailors made their peace then with the Almighty
Still I kept hope in my heart
Through the salt and stormy night
Every hour the wind struck ever harder
We held on tight in the dark
As our bow rose and fell
Till we came with daylight into the harbor
Hard by the monastery walls
To the ringing of a bell
Peter on the White Sea
A day to recall when days are done
Peter on the White Sea
The first of a thousand ships to come
When I took my boat out on the White Sea
I heard my name in the wind
In the bright and empty sky
When I took my boat out to the White Sea",Rock

Don't do this don't do that

Don't speak with food in you mouth

It's just because I really care
You know that I love you
But shut your mouth
You just have to do what I say
I don't want you to lie

I've paid to raise you good
Done everything I could
So don't you dare to say
That I never cared about you anyway
I gave you food to eat
I kept you on your feet
I gave you all my good advice
Not once did I hear you thank me for all that I've done
You don't know anything
About my suffering
I went through a lot of pain
Just to get you where you are today
If I ever hit you
It's because I have to
You have done something wrong
And you deserve the punishment,
You'll have to pay

Be glad with what you've got
Don't tell me you're alone

It's for you own good

I did a lot of crazy things back when I was young
And I've still got her footprints on my heart and on my mind
She's a mistake I made when I was twenty-one
And twenty-four and twenty-eight and twenty-nine

For every night I spent in her arms I spent two on my knees
Begging her to stay and live in my world needing her desperately

"I hate the sound of an alarm clock in my ear
When I've been up all night downing a case of beer
I pray the Lord my soul for him to keep
Don't you know that my rest just don't come cheap
Fuck off I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying to sleep
Too much coffee I need a sleeping pill
I need a rest but ya know I never will
I've been awake so long feels like the four day creep
It won't be long before they bury me six feet deep
When I get tired and longing for my bed
I plug my ears, hide my achin' head
I shut the world out, my seclusion is deep
All I really want is to get some sleep",Metal
"Take a breath
And ill give it to you
Knowing that its my last
Parting gift
She wanted to move like the wind blows
Shes calling to me I cant say no
Sunshine did your shadow notice me
falling behind the kite
Oh they looked on jealously
Drowning in you
Lost in your memory
Caught in a gale
Blown out to sea
Counting on you
hoping I survive
I've waited too long
to close my eyes
now.
I'm hearing her sing
When the wind blows
Shes calling to me I cant say no
Your smile
Oh it weakens my knees
So hold me a while
And ill go
Quietly
Drowning in you
Lost in your memory
Caught in a gale
Blown out to sea
Counting on you
Hoping I survive
I've waited too long
To close my eyes

One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last
Now romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right next time
That's the end of me
My name is not susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about susan
She got nothin' on me
So show some respect
For the love you receive
Get it right
Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same
Now romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say good-bye to me boy

I never wanna be the girly
That you call one and only
You know the kind of girly
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame
Forgot my name
Well anyway

You play the artist, saying, ""Is it how she moves, or how she looks?""
I say, its loneliness suspended to our own like grappling hooks,
And as long as shes got noise, shes fine.
But I could teach her how I learned to dance when the musics ended,
Oh, and thats not petty, as cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already,
I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.
You tried to make me doubt, to make me guess, tried to make me feel like a little less,
Oh, I liked you when your soul was bared, I thought you knew how to be scared,
And now its amazing what you did to make me stay,
But truth is just like time, it catches up and it just keeps going,
And so Im leaving, you can find out how much better things can get,
And if it helps, Id say I feel a little worse than I did when we met,
So when you find someone else, you can try again, it might work next time,

I was led on I suppose
For the Gypsy was always out of reach
I crossed her palm with silver just to know
What the future had to hold
But she only turned her back on me
The Gypsy said no man could make her stay
I followed anyway
Living only day to day
I left the rose as quiet as the night
Whatever she felt then, she kept inside
Ah, the years they seemed to change my Gypsy's soul
She grew weary of the road
Looking round for a better way to live
She traded in her caravan for gold
Pretty things to have and hold
Always wanting more than I could give
Came the day I just had to go
She screamed I should have known
But I never thought Id fall
I said You're the one who had the crystal ball
Perhaps you never saw me there at all
Torn between the Gypsy and the Rose
It was Romany I chose
I was only caught up in a dream
If you see someone wearing Gypsy clothes
Be wary of the pose
For she may not be all that she seems
The Rose moved on, she left here long ago
For where, nobody knows
Just to find another life
I think about her sometimes in the night
I never knew the red rose from the white

Lookin like a plate, tuck it or you gon' get took for your chain
Him and his partners mannish body wounds mean in the hood
Came with an AK-47, pistol, handgun, assault weapon
I be tryina tell my lil grimey, ""Slow down! "" But he ain't listenin
Lil nigga hardheaded, look forward to goin to prison
Don't care if he make it to 25, he ain't trippin
Fifi, belushi, and pill, syrup and chacha sniffin


My lil grimey be lurkin and prowlin in the wee hours of the night
With the hungry man and his...
Lookin to bump heads or cross paths with anybody that he got a problem with
Lurkin at the gas station on some old floop shit
Trained and programed to go, about his dough
A hitter, not a barber but carry a extra clipper
Got hella next of kin cousins and uncles up out the Rich
El Sobrante and Hercules teach him taught him how to fish
My lil grimey nigga, all the time right behind me nigga
On the block with the Glock where you can find me nigga
They didn't see his face, but everybody knew his name
Everybody knew his name, silhouette his body frame
I wonder what set he claim? For the money, fuck the fame
Do he make it rain? Hell nah, he gangbang 
My lil grimey nigga, keep a dumper stashed in his motor
Set to set robbin niggas, he's a floater

"I ain't from Texas, but I made my way from Dallas
And I know the lonesome sound is following
I ain't a gambler, but I can recognize a hand
And when to hold, when the queens are staring back at me
Once I was a carpenter, man my hands were calloused
I could swing a metal mallet sure and straight
But I took to the highway, a poet young and hungry
And I left the timbers rotting where they lay
Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
Well we're all in this together
If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die
I don't come from Detroit, but her diesel motors pull me
And I followed till I finally lost my way
And now I spend my days in search of a woman we called purpose
And if I ever pass back through her town I'll stay
Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
And when the black dress drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
We're all in this together
If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die
And my life is but a coin, pulled from an empty pocket
Dropped into a slot with dreams of sevens close behind
Hope and fear go with it, and moon and the sun go spinning
Like the numbers and fruits before my eyes
Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind
Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind
Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
Well we're all in this together
If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die",Country

Emerald birds glide through a rainbow as they fly
Bringing beauty Holly enters my mind
Where the crystal ocean finds the shore
Diamond waves reflect the love we shared before
Through the silence Holly enters my mind
All alone as I walk by the sea
Thoughts of Holly are my company
For she calls to me with each shining ray
With each season's change
With the sun and the sea and the sky she remains

On a velvet wind she comes to me each day

The moon a phantom rose
Through the mountains and the pine

I fell out of her heart

Would appear in a place that was weird and absurd,
While my face is replaced with a picture of me,
Where you see all the faults of the fake imagery,
In the great industry I've been made by the trade
While I make my mistakes in this great masquerade
The parade is all phony and they're laughing at me,
When they see how I deal with my own misery
History is repeated and my brain is deleted
But I'll stay in my seat up until I'm defeated
The beat may be distant but I still hear the click
And I'll kick up a storm until I make myself sick
And when I loose the plot and they tighten the knot
Then I'll take what I can, when I can while I'm hot
I've figured out the plot, I'll give it what I've got
I'll give it my best shot, if you like it or not
I want just World domination
Give me world domination 
It's been more than a year of ignoring my fear
'cause I've cleared out my thoughts until they disappeared
I still hear the signals and I see all the signs
They've all been assigned to the back of my mind
And I find that in time all my doubts are outshined
By a new kind of faith that I place in my shrine
I refuse to resign or give in to my wims
So I follow the line for as long as my limbs
Choose to carry my weight and my heart still pulsates
The stakes may be high but I can't hesitate
I'll do whatever it takes to break out of this mould
And to shake off the demons and whatever upholds
Me from being the best I can possibly be
The most meanest and leanest and dopest MC
I've figured out the plot, I'll give it what I've got
I'll give it my best shot, if you like it or not
I want just World domination
Give me world domination 
You can all hate me but you can't duplicate me
'cause' I've been copywrited and no one can break me
I'll shake up your rumours with humour that's lethal
Til' you understand that you can't be my equal
'there won't be no sequel for as long as I'm standing
It's totally wrong it's a misunderstanding
Or a misunderstatment do you need a translation
Killing you with my mouth is my main occupation
I've figured out the plot, I'll give it what I've got
I'll give it my best shot, 'cause' I'm right on spot

Depths of age pale away
And I am trying to rediscover
The wide-eyed beauty of the first glance
And you can take what's mine,
Add to the weight of time
With cold eyes and a furrowed brow
And you can take what's mine,
Turn back the hands of time
But for young, time is the sun
From where does fear spawn,
From the older ingrained scorn
Does it mean that my mind won't cry
And I can't believe that you're happy to bleed
From your cold eyes
Each year I peel back my skin
And fleshy pink appears
Yet a harder layer grows,
To protect my uncertainty
Young grow fear to love,
Resist my resistance

And for you, I'll go to the moon,

Awesome Lord, mighty King
He reigns through all the universe

Let the devil take tomorrow Lord tonight I need a friend

"I was dreaming that I was caught up in the middle of a parade
But I wasn't paying attention to the statement being made
And when I looked up at a banner and saw just what it said
Then I wished that I was somewhere else instead
Because the message on the banner was for white supremacy
And no matter how hard I tried it didn't make any sense to me
So I studied the people around me trying to think of what to say
But the only thing I could think of was to laugh and walk away
I was dreaming that I was talking to a man about his faith
And I was far away from home in some kind of exotical place
The situation was such that when I looked at my surrounding
I got nervous and my heart just started pounding
I realized that I was the only man that was Caucasian
All the people around me looked like oriental Asian
I was a legal alien in a difficult situation
But I could relate to the state I was in when I thought about discrimination
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
I was dreaming that I was at home and when I took a look around
It was as if the entire population had suddenly gone underground
I was standing all by myself and there was no one to be found
The only thing worse than a terrible noise is not even hearing a sound
There wasn't a trace of a human face as far as my eyes could see
I started to feel kind of lonely and I wanted some company
I had to make do with myself and the thought didn't appeal to me
'Cause the only thing worse than to many people is feeling completely lonely
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Anybody could be related with a monkey in a tree
Or an ancient tribe from Africa but that doesn't bother me
I've probably got lots of relatives that are Jews and nobody knows
Maybe that's the reason for the size of my big and beautiful nose
My family tree is a mystery that comes from all over the place
So tell me the logical definition of a perfect race
Some people are dressed in a darker tan and some have a lighter shade
And I can assure you nobody's sure exactly where they were made
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time
Or was I in the wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Wrong place, wrong time or wrong state of mind
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time

And habits just as strange

When the heart does so much talking
That the dialogs becomes a way of rhyme
We could go on weighing
Our peace in good measures
We still would have run out of time
So don't weigh your body down
If you wanna shout it out loud
I will be your ears
And I would tell you I'm so proud
Of our love up to the last
How it all flipped by so fast
Give us both chance to rise
After a fall like this
Oh, oh, oh
I wish you all that you could wish for
All that you can hold
But this love is deeper waters
To no mold
Open your arms again in time
You will find comfort there

las orejas calientes
un dembow al caminar que es indecente

ella camina la pista como pasarela
haciendo poses
un viaje ligando sus tatuajes
de oidos que son doble sentido ma'

No me hagas sentirlo Exala
Siento que la nuve me acorrala
y se me pegan toas las vivoras malas
salta conmigo pa ver si usted se resvala
pasamos de la disco ala zala
de pasapalo
con el cosquilleo
pa que no incumba
cuando las paredes se derrumban
retumba la casa
yo saco la botella y las tazas
bebemos y chequeamos lo que pasa ma'
usted tiene una mirada que me busca
una falda que se ajusta
un deporte que es de mala conducta
y me gusta
disculpa que la interrumpa
pero me tiene mal y no es mi culpa NÃ¡
Tu me miras y yo te miro
en la disco bailando

"Cause I told 'em about that little boy of mine
And how his first word about that old truck was Giddy up go
Well today I was barrelin' down old 66
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me
A big ole lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cough
A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddy up go
Well I pushed old Giddy up go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen
And I lost all track of pop cause mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on the old 66",Country

Whoa
I'm telling you now
You should try to talk before you shout
We had it all before we found
That the only thing anyone wanted was more
Verse 2
We exceeded everyone
We would have pleaded to have won
We can look back on what we've done
And say that we know that we've gone and done it all

Never answer again
Not to anyone

This road is all you'll have
All you'll ever know

I hope you realise i wont let this go

And now you're off the rails

We had it all
But you can't buy us with a win full
If you don't give us what we want
Then we'll push it right back
Cus' we're in for the long run

If I lost you it would break this heart of mine
I'm not leaving you it's all in your mind

When hearts are broken each and every day
Just listen to your heart and what it tells you don't listen to the lies that people say
It's all in your mind that I could let you go I tried to think you'd never hurt me so
For I know that I can't change this heart of mine

"Go runaway in distress trying
To hide from what's
Creeping and crawling and stabbing
Within try to deny the turmoil inside
If you find yourself far enough you'll never win
In the ounce of serenity
I will come home be pissed
Can't leave you weeping on the phone
Gasping for breath
To be left on the floor gasping for breath!

No he's not the person you are
Or the person your trying trying trying trying to be
Don't let the outside swing to far from where you want to be
We are heading for moments of this
You can roll with the best
Where's your body so brutally pressed
Against the confines of your dead flesh
And if you close your eyes tight enough
Then none of the bad can get in x2
And if you close your eyes tight enough
Then none of the light can get in
You scream as the light hits you
And radiates upon your whole soul
The pain is burning and cleanses anything
It still fucking hurts and your still fucking down
That you are still alone
That you are still in control
Don't know where to go
The day were all dead
Underground back took a chance to out live your past
Where you will be free

Reflects a cloud on me makes my future look dim

I've grown used to losing
What I'm fondest of

My whole life through

For someone like you

The time has come to say goodbye to the old guard.
Goodnight.

We will not suffer their reprise.
A brave new voice rings out.
Intense, fearless, devout.
A listless body now revived.
Old stories fit with retreads.
Half-truths with truth left unsaid.
Each time their lips moved we heard lies.
So now it's time to say goodbye...
To the old guard, goodnight, goodbye.
To the old guard, goodnight, goodbye.
Witness the setting sun.
This century's crash and burn.
Autocracy dethroned by ire commissar doused in fire.
Make note a million times.
Their class war, deceit, lies.
Their compassion laced with despise...
All of the hatred they bred.
All the division they spread.
We always knew they lived on lies.
So now it's time to say goodbye...
Bear witness to this setting sun.
The dawning of a new age has begun.
From east to west we watch this setting sun.
The dawning of a new age has begun.

Have you ever made love while you watched the late, late show

John Mohammed Lee Malvo when me and the kid split
Surgical when I'm in a convertible state of mind
Lock me in the pen watch the murder rate decline
I'll do mine like Shyne soon as I hit the bricks
You better have fake on that Bad Boy shit
I got niggas that'll kidnap kids to get dough
And dress up like SpongeBob in a six-four
It's fucked up what they did so I'm on one knee
God bless the brother of rich fo'
Ain't no love lost I'm still Don sippin'
Readin' the LA Times and Louis Vuitton slippin'
Sittin' behind bars for the simple fact that the
Hip Hop police is drivin' behind Scar's
Air Force One's in the Bentley GT
It's the reason I'm still rap's MVP

Ugh.. so much glamour that I can't stand the
Bright from the ice the chain xenon lamp ya
Impression in your mind like a freeze-frame camera
The white tee tight like you seen on Pampers
What's under the couch probably free off santa
Whatever it cost baby we got answers
Line outside full of jojo dancers
We Got It 4 Cheap that's the re-up anthem
By far the coldest '06 Lotus
Zero to sixty hokus-pokus
The feds don't know so they stick they noses
While we off the coast proposin' toast-es
Hoes and mo' shit the family close-knit
And deep like the who too you cockroaches
Just like the flow the fo's ferocious

"I saw your flag
Another star, another stripe
What's your new bag?
Something real or just some hype
Tell me, what have you sown
Have you prospered and grown?
Why shouldn't you have your moments of genius
Just because our alliance broke with no
Civil words between us
Oh, my beautiful enemy, beautiful
I send my scorn and ridicule
You're not innocent
No, not innocent
No one's innocent
My nation's grand
Your name's not on any signs
It's so well-planned
And well-groomed and yet somehow
The past tornadoes through
People talk about you
Can't they see that your reign
Is steely and torturous?
I start thinking that I am sinking
Inside a hollow fortress
Oh, my enemy, beautiful enemy
My stride is slowed by memory but
Not innocent
No, not innocent
No one's innocent
In my furies of dream
The juries denounce you
There I stand with the upper hand
But in order to trounce you
I just keep getting above myself
I just keep getting above myself
And so I'm worried but as I stated
Things can be complicated, but
You're my enemy
You're my enemy
You're my enemy
The future's bright
There are new things we will love
It feels so right
Let's not make up or rise above
Yes, we are more corrupted
Happy and productive
We'll both live in a world of civilized
People
Though I've heard that my brand new church
Has a slightly higher steeple
Oh, my enemy, beautiful enemy
Hail to your vast hegemony
You're not innocent

There go that man again, right back in the public eye
Drunk like Mel Gibson, get high, got a ton of DUI's
Cognac sipping, XO, me and my guys
Born in colossal, living our lives
Trying to get this bobble head bobbin' so she can follow me to my ride
So I can make a dentist to convince her to open wide
Kick her out when I'm finished, take my baller ass back inside
Drug terminology, corner talk that's all I know
California mentality, ask about me pimp I go
You can check my track record, I don't like to feud
But if I must I'll have your head severed
Blacks live in traps, zones and projects
Corner boy greeting crack in the apartment complex
World wide outside of the Bay they give me my stacks
Do business with head execs and corporate execs

He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice

Be a real one, pimp, go get it and do what he used to
Trying to get this music scrapping, move it, push it and groove it
Louis luggage, rugging and rushing my intellect
Got suckas hollering and screaming my hood set
Designer socks on my Chevy box shaking the car
You need my alpha minute, too heavy I can't stop
Gaming plot, all my dudes on the grave clock
Hope I die and rock on my funeral on my block
The streets they don't play fair
The mayor, he really don't care
Momma worked 3 jobs, trying to keep a roof on hour heads
Bologna sandwiches, pulled the mold off the bread

In the thick of the soil, we think Buick's is Bentley's
Coffee pots boil, burn, fly, simmer and stew

Out of the Beverly camp you need a crew
Showing our underwear, exactly that's what we do

Beside me like a furnace

And leave me out so long, I doubt I'm ever gonna be

And I never will play the wild rover no more.
And it's no, nay, never,
No nay never no more,
Will I play the wild rover

And I told the landlady me money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me ""nay
Such a custom as yours I could have any day.""
And it's no, nay, never,
No nay never no more,
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more.
And out of me pocket I took sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight.
She said ""I have whiskey and wines of the best
And the words that I said sure were only in jest.""
And it's no, nay, never,
No nay never no more,
Will I play the wild rover

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son.

Then I never will play the wild rover no more.

Only the Lord can tell who dies
So pick up the puzzle and pieces and put it together my love
My lordy Lord, maintain, it's hard 'cause I'm a soldier at war
'Cause every body wanna try to bring out the devil in me
But the evils ain't better than me, weed keeps me at ease
Take notes 'cause here it comes
The murder mo comin' to carry you, oh you oh
Wake up and they sittin' and pulling their gauge out, murder
And they put it up to your temple and we blow your brains out, die
Now come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugz
We more than thugz, more than thugz, more than thugz
With just a little twist of harmony we smokin' lethal warriors
We warriors, we warriors, we warriors
Now come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugz
We more than thugz, more than thugz, more than thugz
With just a little twist of harmony we smokin' lethal warriors
We warriors, we warriors, we warriors
Now come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugz
We more than thugz, more than thugz, more than thugz
With just a little twist of harmony we smokin' lethal warriors

"Half of my mistakes I made stone cold sober
Half of my mistakes I've made at closing time
Half the time I never saw it coming, until it was over
Oh, and half of my mistakes I've made with love the line
Half of my mistakes I swear, I should've known better
Half of my mistakes were just amongst friends
You get a little distance on it, the truth is clearer
On, and half of my mistakes I'd probably make 'em again

If I it all to do over
I'm sure I'd win and lost just as much
but spend alot less time on right and wrong
and a lot more time on love
Half of my mistakes I've made 'cause I was moving to quickly
Half of them where made 'cause my heart was moving too slow
Nobody can tell you a damn thing, if you ain't listening
Oh, And half of my mistakes I've made 'cause I couldn't let go

If I it all to do over
I'm sure I'd win and lost just as much

and a lot more time on love
Half of my mistakes I'd give anything to change how it ended
Oh, and half of my mistakes, God, I wouldn't change one thing

Shallow and empty life lingers on
It grieves my heart, it tears me apart
I hear this constant disharmony
Lost in a dead world
With broken wings
Human reality feeds upon a whore
For what idols have these lowlifes
bowed their heads to build up a shattered world?
Kill the bitch on the cross
Scorn their sacred loss
And the sheeps are making love to the madness of the flow
Is this all they know?
The madness of the flow will take the final blow,
as the sun goes down over mankind's tomb
in the universal graveyard of filth and slime
This is Our time
Lost in a sick world

Curse them all
Lead them astray

She said my girl is fine; just bought a house, got a job, real good man
I told her I was glad for you; that's wonderful
But does she ever ask 'bout me?
She said she's happy with her life right now
Let her go, let her be
And I told myself I would, but something in my heart just would not let you go
I just want to know

What if we were wrong about each other?
What if you were really made for me?
What if we was 'sposed to be together?
Would that not mean anything?
What if that was 'sposed to be my house that you go home to every day?
How can you be sure that things are better?
If you can't be sure your heart is still here with me
Still wanting me
Your friend asked me if there was someone special in my life that I was seeing
I told her there was no one in particular
There's just I, myself, and me
I told her that I dream of you quite often
She just cut her eyes at me
She said you got a home, you're very happy
So just stop your meddling
I told her that I won't
I said things were cool, but I guess I was wrong
I still can't move on

Now that could be my car
That could be my house
That could be my baby boy that you're nursing
That could be the trash that I always take out
That could be the chair that I love to chill in
That could be my food on the table at the end of the day
Hugs and the kisses, all the love we make
What the hell do you expect me to say?
What if it's really 'sposed to be this way?
What if you're really 'sposed to be with me?

what do we do when sanity crumbles
How do we handle the threat
How do we act when dignity stumbles
How do we live with regret
No time to think, either I act or I walk
Should I go inbetween or just try to talk
The longer I wait the worse everything gets
And the verbal abuse turns into fysical threats

It all happened right in front of my eyes
It took me one second and then I realized
If I don't react, next time it might be me

Do I follow my brain or just go with my heart

A child with faith, faith will fly
Anita hasn't walked right since she was small
Her legs are short and twisted not straight and tall
She learned when she was young how to deal with the rejection
Cast into a world with all it standards of perfection
Most people looked away with a downward glance
And as a beautiful young woman, she was never asked to dance
Her dreams were just as lofty as the girl next door
And she remember what her father said when she couldn't take no more
He said
Someday your going to soar like a eagle,
You will run and never grow tired
You'll become a new creation
If you just keep the faith of a child,
Keep the faith of a child
Now Anita lives alone in a paper mill town
In a one room apartment at sixth and brown
She's got a steady job well its all right for now
She has plans for moving on if she can make it some how
Her brown hands are folded as she bows her head to pray
Over doughnuts and some coffee she made up yesterday
Her mind begins to travel, she gives thanks to the lord
And a angel stands beside her, points out to the door
And said
Today you going to soar like a eagle
You will run and never grow tired
You've become a new creation

To the North Pole for Saint Nick

Hear those magic reindeer click

Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

And for a time it seemed
Every road you took turned wrong
But a second chance would come
With each new bridge you burned
I know you squandered some
But then from some you learned
And the point of rescue well
You passed that long ago
O but to hear you teil it was
Just another part of the show
O Evangeline your faith shone blind and true
We raise our glass and sing
Of you Evangeline

The nights so hard and mean
You shed them like a skin
For you were always strong
When the bad slid down to worse
You still had that song
It was your blessing and your curse
But in your tongue
There is no word for home
There'll be no one
To roll away the stone
O Evangeline you have been a prisoner here
Bread and roses we shall bring
To you Evangeline
O Evangeline what are you fighting for
You stayed out in that ring
When nobody's even keepin' score
But round by round you earned
Your stumble into grace
Still with every turn the world
Becomes a sadder place
It swallows up the ones
You have loved the most
So you sleep with none
You wake with ghosts
O Evangeline
You have salted with your tears
Every lonely mile you've seen
through the years Evangeline
It's a fatal shore
You now wash upon
So weary of the war
And no longer young

Out one night to seek a mate
I asked a stranger for a date
And guess what she said
I like her man was cool, but i
Was sexier than any guy
She'd ever met
Maybe if I took a chance
To find a night of sweet romance
Love wouldn't be
Waiting for my ship to come
And catch this player on the run
I wanted to see, oh, her eyes
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger

Her eyes were filled with danger
She was such a pretty thang
Maybe that's why I was game
Walkin' the line
So we took a rendezvous
To satisfy each other's mood
Time after time
As I looked into her eyes
Wondering if they were disguised
A mystery to me 
All I felt was instant lust
Knowing it was dangerous
But I had to see, oh, her eyes
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger

Her eyes were filled with danger

Skinned alive and writhing in anguish
Suffering with pain and fear
A fate worse than death; denied of dignity

"Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
I owe you for this one
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes .
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on

"Our bodies lay here side by side
But our thoughts have turned the other way
We make the conversation of two people
Who have nothing left to say
We're so accustomed to each other
We no longer care or bother
And there lies the danger
You know the size of clothes I wear
You know how I comb my hair
But you could know as much about a stranger
I can't remember the last time
That I really wanted you
And we both say nothings wrong
But it's here in everything we do
So we get up from our beds
Leaving many thing unsaid
And there lies the danger
Many of my words you don't hear
You seldom notice if I'm near
You could know as much about a stranger
What went wrong, I can't name it
Find the fault, I can't blame it
On any one thing
We're so used to things this way
Tomorrow's just like yesterday
And there lies the danger
You know the colour of my eyes
You know the things I despise
But you could know as much about a stranger
Yes, you could know as much about a stranger",Country

"Outside of this world
There's a life force still burning
Outside of this land
There's a star shining free
In silence we stand
On a golden horizon, calling
This time has no light for us
Still shining so bright for us
Again
Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding
While there are so many faces in this mask of lies
Blinded by the promises and the life in pain
Now the time has come for all of us to rise
Through the fires of hell between us
Through a lifetime of our dreams
Endless tears still burn inside
Beneath the sadness of our screams
At the edge of our forsaken lands
Sign that we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel
And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
For the last time we cry now for freedom
Cast aside, this dying world forsakes us
Break the chains of our creation now to save our lives
Blight of all eternity and the curse of steel
Like the winter rain will tear the blazing skies
From the wastelands of destruction
With the fire we hold inside
Rise again, still glorious
For the power of all man kind

For the trials of far behind us
In the dark and burning skies
Fallen tears still lost inside
Within the memories of our lives
From the years of our forsaken lands

Nothing to say when the evil finally burns
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone

Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel

As not many can

By the love, of a good man

And brought me down
From on up there
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
I missed it now and then
But I have no wish to go back there
There I was,
Sitting on the roof of the world
There I was, with all the Gods

Now you can either try to join us or run from us,

Choclair gon' leave your brain scarred
The situation's hard
These niggas who be hating and dissing,
but now I'm paid, now they looking for jobs
I don't give a fuck of what you saw back in 9-5
All things that I say, despite your long eyes
Were all wise, leave you in awe like God rise
All words that I say, All get! All kinds!
And break all spines, and why wouldn't
Cause when these peoples ask who diss, I be like ""I did it""
So many niggas be dissing us niggas
But when these niggas confront 'em,
up in their face that they be afraid to admit it
I slap 'em in the face and make, every rhyme spitted
You heard this kid, roll with me, glide with me
Take my hand, come slide with me
Do you think you roll with Chocs and Bleek

So don't be bringing your shit round here
My advice to you is get your ass back
Before it get slapped, turned out, and pushed back

Wanna see a nigga fall, get it on with the cops

Yo, you see the Memph man laid up, paid up
Instead you wanna see a nigga sprayed up
Only use the waste up
And I still bust off nuts, with a numb dick straight up
Fuck y'all nigga wanna do, Huh duke
I know thug niggas creep with a gun duke
Me too, except, I got one in the hand for the jump off
Niggas still ain't learned the ledge, nigga jump off
It's real here, playa, you know what the deal here
Niggas in wheelchairs won't sit still here
Battery pack cats, get their cavity cracked black
In fact, I still ain't stop pointing the mack
At y'all niggas who hate me, don't mistake me

"When she was an American Girl, raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life, somewhere else
After all, it was a great big world,
With lots of places to run to,
And if she packed up, trying,
She got one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh yeah, alright
Take it easy baby, make it last all night
She was an American Girl!
Well, it was kinda cold that night,
She stood alone on her balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by on the road 41
Like the waves crashing on the beach
Checked for one desperate moment there,
He crimped back in her memory
God, it's so painful something that's so close,
But still so far out of reach!

"I keep thinking each and every day.
Have I really made a difference, have I made things change?
In all these years of ""growing up,"" and ""standing strong,""
Has it made a single dent with all that is so wrong?

But if I haven't done a thing for world affairs,
At least I know I try and I'll show that I care.
'Cause it's me that has to make an effort,
Or what can I expect to change.
That's where it starts, in myself,
Not just shifting all the blame.
And as I'm growin' older, I can see the changes.
Yet history ain't history at all it seems,
I try to keep my head held high, eyes open wide,
And growing keeps me learning, yeah it keeps me free.

"Blow, silver wind, with a whoop from the mountains,
Strike up a tune in the ropes and the rig!
Blow, lucky breeze, come kiss the white canvas,
the anchors are up, boys, it's time for a swig.
No don't turn your backs, boys, let's face the land squarely,
watching her glimmer away in the mists.
We gave her our guts, but she fed us just barely.
We'll go where there's use for our backs and our fists!
Blow, silver wind, with a sight from the mountains.
Whisper a word from the hills and the streams.
Blow, wind of sorrow, hasten the hour.
Let us be gone now. There's no time for dreams.
No, don't turn around. Pray the wind will keep blowing.
There is no returning so don't look behind.
What we have lost there is no way of knowing.
No way of knowing what we shall find...
Blow, silver wind, with a song from the mountains!
Wish us God speed with a cheer from afar!
Blow, wind of hope, for your children departing.
We know what you gave us. We know who we are.
So look alive all! Feel the old ship is straining,
already she's wetting her nose in the brine.
So, look to the East where the old land is waning,
and look to the West where the new land shall shine....",Folk

When the traps side up and the MAC slow down
You better hit the deck because it might go down
Don't get caught slipping, yeah it might go down

Keep an eye on your nigga, and running around town

Young nigga seventeen, trying to get money
Niggas laugh about the dough but really ain't shit funny
Just watch who you serve with them birds little buddy
Every fiend ain't a fiend if you see them look funny
You better tell your team, you don't need that money
That shit smell funny, you ain't getting shit from me
I stacked a couple hundred fiends on these something
That white keep coming, tell the boy to keep bumping
Well watch these folks keeping enemies close
And any nigga kin to me they better not fold
He say that he a friend to me but snitching to the po'
He pointing on the court, tell the judge what he know
Price on his head, he be dead by four, so homie don't slip
Or you could be him, no speaking on the phone
Because them FEDS get tips, don't get caught slipping
Because it might be them


And I won't be slipping, the boy's on a mission
Only vision of winning and my sight is on a million
Serving that white girl to any nigga want to get it
And fresh Louis linen dawg can call that pimping
That thing on my side, homeboy I ain't slipping
Your boy's off snitching, tell them niggas ain't with it
It might go down, so watch you do a round
Niggas creep in the town leave bodies left on the ground

Because the chopper get down
I stay in all black with a Florida Marlin crown
So keep away the faking ain't a real nigga around
If you ever go down stay loyal to your fam'
And you don't know shit, never snitching on the mound
And homie don't slip, because it might go down

I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight

I'm cruisin' down a one way street and I done passed fun day
Three blocks ago
It itself life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' how come
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself bein' nobody's Calvin
But I'm a couch bum what makes it bad I had incentive
But I disintegrated
To a state that's stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated
Or blowed
Ain't dealin' with a full deck and any day I could fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to

How I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my concentration
In this idiotic nation
They say become I doctor, but I don't have the patients/patience
Adjacent
To that situation
I want an occupation
That I'm into
'Cause yet if I begin to
Live to my potential
I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience
I reminisce and wish
I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just sunshine
But now it's like I'm gettin' older to so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest
In peace

And find
Who I am

Tell her she's the sweetest, pull her mental file
See if I can help cause she's livin in denial, bitch

Smokin herb, grindin in my dirty clothes what else?

Uh-huh; barbecue or mildew, hhhoe?
Ssshit heh
My fetti has a first name - it's E-A-are-L
About my mail, ssshit!
Nigga you know I'm up in this motherfucker, on a good one!
Fffuck yes!!

You know what I mean? It's like a, a why-2-Yea thing why'know?
 We does this out here 
We pop our collars; please believe that playboy 
My moves is swift, I'm stiff with mine
Remi Martin straight, then I hit it with lime
It's time to shine, to strike my pose
Five carats on my pinky, pickin my nose 
I stroll on hoes, and give 'em a chance
to let me see the ass while they backup dance
I glance and breeze - if the body is true
I'm off and on to part two 

Now I done scanned at the club 
I popped my collar to all my folks with love 
And all the niggaz that didn't respond to me 
I got my dogs watchin constantly 
With one hand in the baseball glove
Hella throwaways - and dangerous subs
For my protection and my protection only
This boss balla slippin whatchu thought I was phony?

Fresh up out my Coupe de Ville, I popped my collar twice
About my money this loot is real, plus I'm dipped in ice
I got a fat mansion on the hill, cause I made a mill'
So if you see me please believe, cause I'm yo' potnah still

 It's all from the wrist
 Been poppin my collar since Moby was a goldfish..
.. leavin 'em curious
Hoppin out of my Lincoln Continental, signature serious..
.. parkin lot pimpin!
One of my niggaz yell  while I was pissin
Is that young 40 why'all?
Drunk as fuck and about to fall?

Done washed my shoes, the gators they bite
Baby bright light but not my type
But if she want tonight, she come with dollars
She either holler, or pop a nigga collar
I'm fresh up out that Coupe de Ville
Four times gold on my vogue wheels
Big sunroof with the insides ill
Gotta give it to the boy he got skills

 Made a mill'.. uh-huh, HOE BEATCH!

 I done stepped on in
 Now can I come up?
All these freaks hang out at the dump
Me and my dogs got this party on pump
All the hoes look like they want to hump
I'm bout to pull a lil' lightweight stunt

On a mizznission about that cut
Rough, buck, smokin on a blizznut
Ticked, pucked, ?? ?? was loc'd
Dick, Van Dyke, all up in her truck
Lick, at night, E-Feezy ain't no punk
Gobble, swallow, get her hella drunk
40 ounce bizznottle, til I tr-uh-Trump
Tip, hollow, mizzmillimeter thump
Feels no sinorrow for a sucka sap chump
Ya underdig? Yeah just

Pull it a lil' bit

Dipped in ice..

Didn't come to stay I just came to play
So lock all the doors and open up the wine
Tell all the babes to stand in line
Drunk and crazy let the good times roll
Way across the room I see a fancy fox
Got the key to open up her lock
So I slide across the florr with my sex appeal
And said hey babe how do you feel
Just about to put my cake in her over
Opened the door and there was her husband
He was seein blue and turnin red
Slapped me down stomped on my head
Got me to the hospital in the nic of time
Had a fractured skill and a busted spine
Doctor came in he could hardly stand
He has a bottle in his pocket and a scalpel in hand",Rock

Iced out watch Knots in my socks

And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride
You're just mad cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talkin' bout: Where the gun at?
I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm stayin legit
I love to see cars come cruisin' bye and playin' my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pist-ol, my whole cliques wild
I'm rich pal, no more sticks I'm makin hits now
I drink Cristal, I'm through breakin' laws
I don't sell coke anymore, I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakes'll do whatever it takes
Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mouse trap, I doubt that
Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be callin' it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Aiyyo enough's enough, federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus, they want a nigga soul, but they know
Big Joey Crack'll never rat a cat that he know
Fo' sho', death before dishonor; I left the streets alone
Since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So I'mma keep doin what I'm doin
Pursuin' my dream 'til there's enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real, I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witness that you claim to have, sayin' that I'm takin half
Extortin' New York and not payin' tax?
I'm laid back, playin the role, layin the low
But it's the same ol' Joe so don't get K.O.d
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid, why don't they just let a nigga live?

S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

Now we would like to ask you
Have you ever heard this style befo'
You gotta say no
Cause there ain't no denying
And if you say yes you're lying
People are always wondering
What's up with the Underground
Are they down?
Or is just another new sound
We're saying things
And when we use a beat we use it right
Cause we're not just playing things
Spitting rhymes
Like a Tommy gun spraying things
So when you see us onstage
Don't just stare us down
Or compare our sound
To any other crew ya like
Yo, judge how ya like


Riding this like a roller coaster
Hugging the curves and dipping
Like I'm supposed to do
For the Underground troupe
Cause I know I'm the poop
Steaming hot
Stinking up the dance floor
Gonna do it freelance
For the funk, my friends
And all the others in the industry
They want to get with me

Maybe it's my smooth flow
They know this guy is dope
So they get hip to the style I'm using
It's called Raw Fusion
Ain't no time for ego-tripping
Let it be known
There'll be no slipping on mine
Cause all I want
Is a chunk of this Underground funk


Yo, Money-be

What's up cold Shock G?

Check it out, would you tell the people what we mean

What do you mean what we mean?

You know what I mean
Tell 'em what we mean
When we're are-H-why-M-I-N on the funk
Let 'em know that we got spunk

We got it

And when I count to three
Go on and hit some of that humpty-hump
One, two, three

Well, I'm humpty-humping
You know that I'm saying something
The funk's in your face
Gonna keep the place jumping
As the beat keeps pumping
I'm tick-tocking 'em
Dope rhymes, I'm dropping 'em
On the twenty-four track
And there ain't no stopping 'em
It's too late to put the tape on pause
Because we're


Tell me if you think the beat is nasty
Well get ready, we're going to get sweaty
Just in case I hope you brought a towel in
I'm on the prowl when I hear the bass growling

Growling like a big bass monster
On a rampage, it's like we were onstage

And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
But today I'm overly dedicated,
I'm 'posed to be a testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flyin' with me
Misery loves standing behind his company, well,
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it's appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love, the drop is steep
I heard when you see a dove, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings but I'm still free
'Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray, I'll look you in the eye and say
Let us move on,
Let us move on
For this is short

Let us move on,
Let us move on
For this is short,

"Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.
She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.
She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound
She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian
She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in.
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end.
At least not for Lillian
Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids.
Coulda' been the whiskey,
Coulda been the pills,
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.
Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Country

Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious
Yes, I gotta gap and I think it's a bonus

You know it's on tonight

"Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm I've ever done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To mem'ry now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be to you all
So fill to me the parting glass
And drink a health whate'er befalls
And gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it fell unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all
Fill to me the parting glass
And drink a health whate'er befalls
And gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all

"I was once some mother's darlin'
Some daddy's little girl
More precious than the ruby
More cherished than the pearl
My heart was full of mercy
And my forehead full of curl
Now I am nothing and am lost unto this world
I am lost unto this world...
They herded me like cattle
Cut me down like corn
Took me from my babies
Before they could be born
You can blame it on the famine
You can blame it on the war
You can blame it on the devil
It don't matter anymore
I am lost unto this world...
I was tortured in the desert
I was raped out on the piain
I was murdered by the high way
And my cries went up in vain
My blood is on the mountain
My blood is on the sand
My blood runs in the river
That now washes through their hands
I am lost unto this world...
Can I get no witness this unholy tale to teil
Was God the only one there watching
And weeping as l feil
O you among the living
Will you remember me at all
Will you write my name out
With a single finger scrawl
Across a broken window
In some long forgotten wall
That goes stretching out forever
Where the tears of heaven fall
I am lost unto this world...",Country

"Recientemente en mi casa vive un tipo que manda

Me reta porque sabe que va a ganarme

Verle correr me da miedo

she slept in the arms of nature
she was the princess of passion
the light of day, fairly and sinful
she woke up to a dewfull morning
which kissed her body
and the feeling of vibrations
she flew down to the sea for bathing
and there... she was lost
lost forever in the grip of tenderness
...a tiny voice said...
float into me make love to me
as million drops like these
have people soved into me
...who are you?... i am the one who reflects the sun
i and the waves carresses you gentle
child you must breath
before you sleep
so child breath
...she says...

the trunk without life
dirty water and the sun isn't smiling
why god why

and combined in passion the two lovers were forever...

I wanted her to make me forget you but instead she made me remember
She looked at me with the softest eyes and spoke to me in a gentle whisper
And her body felt like it was gonna melt when I held her close and kissed her
I wanted her lips...
All the nights that I spent dyin' in your arms she made me remember
As she slowly drew up a pattern on my back with a soft side of her finger so tender
I wanted her lips...

Dirt ditch paths and pine cones digging up glass bottles
Rusty springs from feather beds, old hubcaps on the picket fence

She's watching long shadows caught in the tide

I had crew when they stepped at a party
hardly even known I own a Smith & Wesson
but it's resting at home
in a shoe box
they see crews jock
so they wanna step and test the rep I got
I said 'Wait a second,
check inside my coat for a shank'
they must be imagining that I'm money in the bank
they'll get spanked
cause I'm not the nigga
I got bigga brothers waiting in the bushes
to mush kids
I talk when I wanna talk
never silence
violence erupts when I clown ya
catch a beat down ya
cause I never back away from niggas
even if you gotta pistol
I dare ya pull the trigga
but that's suicide
either you must die
or I must
so why bust me
cause I'm guilty
of being in the wrong place
at the wrong time
comin' at ya in the wrong state of mind
I'm now in a hurry
a pow when a flurry
of bullets come speeding by
I needn't die
I gotta make tracks & take back my words
I eat 'em
cause everybody knows I didn't beat 'em...

I don't frown at people
cause they tend to get offended

be on my ass

me & you
we didn't do shit

because we crew & we rollin'
this is my car
it isn't stollen
I hope you catch a slug
straight in your colon
when ya walkin' the beat
I bet ya gotta sheet hangin' up in ya closet
phuck this law shit
but there is two laws to follow, you know
there is laws of the city
and there's laws of the ghetto
I go to clubs with a smile on my face
just in case niggas look & wanna whyle in the place
cause of jealousy
Del is me
only me
niggas walkin' in poppin' shit
that's who the phonies be
peep it one night
and you'll see it it's quite clear
since we all know now
that's why we're
never in the wrong place @ the wrong time!

Damn, I hate cops!
I need to bust they chops
always gettin' props for the niggas they pop
peep,
I smoke weed
get weeded
cause I need it to calm my nerves before a pig get bleeded
I got busted for less than a gram of hash
they wanna cram my ass
in the slammer
that punk po-po
bringin' back hash from Amsterdam is a no-no
I didn't know they would catch me
punk mutt fetch me
stretched me out at Customs
gotta bust 'em
I can't call it
they found it in my wallet
now Customs got me
and I just can't stall it
I wish they would leave me alone

feed me a bone
he might bite me
very likely
they had to strike me with a fine or time

where weeds spring forth from trampled earth

casting leaves upon the night
a train is passing through the yard
pulsing light between its cars
and from each box car's passing door
a ghastly vision peers
it sends a tremor through my skin
for in each car I see again
specter watching from beyond
that's bound to ride like me
reappearing in each passing car
it's eyes sunk in like dying stars
and wherefore has this vision come
that none should see but me
it's face like what my mirror shows
displays my fate from choices chose
fate not sealed not carved in stone
still a different path it excludes
choices yet to make with trains
to ride or lay down on the main
I feel a chill like shards of rime
and light a cigarette
I shudder because freedom found
and maybe it's time to leave this town
so puttin' out my cigarette

I don't give a fuck about who, I don't even know you
Whassup? Yeah pimpin, I got my thang too
And it's cool, cause I know you know it
I ain't even gotta pull it, I ain't even gotta show it
Don't blow it, that's what a black man's thinkin
I'll be layin underground in a casket stinkin
If I slip, I gotta keep my poise
You hear that eight-oh-eight bumpin
Man what's all that noise?
That's the call of my thugs

"The unholy war, when Satan's demons are smeared in blood.
Feathers fall from angel wings, from the sky.
Father Satan gather your legions, it is time to claim your throne.
The arrival of your dominion, so long been gone.
So gather now my legions, it is time to fight for our lord.
Hail Satan, scream the masses, smeared in angel's blood.
Lords of war, the wings of twelve, open all the gates.
Fly high into the canopy; bring to me the head of god.
Hell lord, unholy father.
Your wish is my command.
I will cut the liar throat; Christian blood will fall to the ground.
Demon legions, fly through the gates.
Into the darkened sky.
Held up high, the spears of evil.
As they run, through angels flesh.
They scream out in pain, as they see their kingdom fall.
Angel tears fall to the ground, as Satan again will reign.",Metal

Lock the door of understanding on me

How the tendriled vines have grown
So full in Autumn

Loose your silver hair
'Cause its a long way through the tunnel to the light.
Fates are poised above the strings,
They know the span of life and wings,
You are not of them.

Highway lamps on open roads
That shine above them

Tunnels made of dampened steel

Quiet the sirens
Down every dead end seed
Let in to the sun way
The eye teeth
The diet white tiger
I force her to feed
I came for fire
My shade grows long against the trees
Lift the trumpet
Lead the unicorn
Into the night
No more forlorn
The tower is wired
To fall to a thorn
I came for fire
I put it to each, all form

Before we end
And back to the stars
Return again

From inside the curtain

Twinkles and watches while the other stars die
Upon your empty ears and empty hearts.

I hear a voice on the telephone
Doin' fine - then it hits me
The voice that I am hearing means you're not alone

No going back to the start
You only lose when you hesitate
And now that I would give you my heart
It's too little too late
Two more weeks - I start to wonder
If what I'm missing's really worth these tears
What's the point - you've found another
And I just keep on talking but you just can't hear
You swore you'd wait forever and a day
I never thought I'd live to hear you say

So mad about me
You couldn't live
without meNow you say you're moving on
I took the long way
I told you maybe someday
I guess I made you wait too long
I know I've only got myself to blame
And I've still got my pride but just the same

You only lose when you hesitate
And now I want to give you my heart

I'm not going out tonight
until the songs we know are all played inside,
and the old cars empty rust
and the CD players start to gather dust
somewhere only she knows
in the cheap thrills of the morning
with the cold spill of my woes
There is a place where we are together
where the mountain thyme grows around the heather,
before the drive-thru cinema died
and a truthful word replaced with one big lie
She waits for me there
There is a place where I last saw her,
with a hushed out tone and a borrowed fur,
just as the maps were changed
I took a wrong turn looking for her golden plain,
She waits for me there
in the cold hours of the morning with the wind in her hair

where the air is young and the water's clean,
where the juggernaut cut the sailor's scar

But wanna help spend your ends

Don?t say nothing at all

Hollering at em? back
Pocket full of scraps
Nothing but thousand stacks

Acting a fool making my presence known
I look at business face to face
Don't like to talk on phones
When I'm at a stop sign or a red light
I leave one car space in front of me
Tell it like it is
Just so I could have enough room to get outta there
Just in case someone try to pop at me or something
Tell it like it is
That's how I was raised
I'm still a student of the game
You could learn from a baby

"The legend at hand is one of old and spoken by men of one hundred fold
The end reveals riches and gold, cast in darkness, underneath the earth it lies
Hear the victims ghastly cries as they slowly lose their lives, minds bewildered
Not a shed of hope in sight, no brightness to be guided by
Except the flicker of a light, by the flame, one with a heart so bold,
Strength and might which cannot be told enters the maze of caverns below, penitent
Enter he does against all consciousness, shadows eyes watching from corners, cracks and crevices
Mysterious is the puzzle as he encounters the toils, greed guides him on
Going untouched through tricks and traps, pursuing wealth
Magical are the walls that stand so high, mythical are the tales that one survived
Enter and those to shall find, their lives will soon be left behind Come forth step into the light
Labyrinth twists and turns of fright, recognize you must lose to win
Prepare to once again begin
Getting on to the final stage of this journey, in silence scheming with the assets he yet has
Blinding out of nowhere shines a gleam so bright glorious site his time arrives
Magical are the walls that stand so high, mythical are the tales that one survived
Enter and those to shall find, their lives will soon be left behind Come forth step into the light

Rimmed with little key chain hearts
And they tore those giant tents down
Lions in the pouring rain

Who had a glory bound lonely gaze
She used to fit her head
Inside an elephant's mouth
With some kind of solitude grace
When you find it, oh you better use it up
You better hold on to it
Like it's an answer to your prayers
Spring is coming early this year, you can tell
'Cause everybody's got their old jobs back
No one stays too long around here
They left circles in the wide back fields
And the farmers tried to cover up the scars
You can still run your hands over soft black earth
And wonder where they are
Oh but my son left for the fields today
He's a fourth generation
Works good with his hands
Got his mother's cheeks and a big brass heart
And boy he loves to work that land
Out on the streets in my new city
You can see where shadows
Make prints on the pavement
They know when the Salvation Army truck
Comes around
Lions in the pouring rain
And they're birds in the pouring rain

How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows
I'm going to turn and walk away
There's nothing left for me to say
It wouldn't change things anyway
Though, I suppose
The love I gave was always true
Well, I don't know what else to do
And how I'll ever get over you
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die

How love's made a fool of me

"Measure me in metered lines, in one decisive stare, the time it takes to get from here to there. My ribs that show through t-shirts and these shoes I got for free; I'm unconsoled, I'm lonely. I am so much better than I used to be. Terrified of telephones and shopping mall, and knives, and drowning in the pools of over lives. Rely a bit to heavily on alcohol and irony. Get clobbered on by courtesy, in love with love, and lousy poetry. And I'm leaning on a broken fence between Past and Present tense. And I'm losing all these stupid games that I swore I'd never play. And it almost feels okay. Circumnavigate this body of wonder and uncertainty. Armed with every previous failure, and amateur cartography, I breathe in deep before I spread these maps out on my bedroom floor. Leaving. Wave goodbye. Losing, but I'll try, with the last ways left, to remember. Sing my imperfect offering.",Indie

"November came and went,
Like a summer that I spent,
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes.
I returned to my home,
With a heart part made of stone,
And I cried all night for a girl I never knew.
From the east it comes,
Her love and the rising sun,
And I pray each time they come, it's not the last.
You see I've got strong,
I made it through what came along,
But I can't move on for the beauty of the past.
Came across a pretty girl,
For about a month she was my world,
And I held her hand, and swore we'd never part.
I moved on, she stayed behind,
I said I'd call, she said she'd write,
We lost touch the moment I drove off.
I left town like a gambler with,
The sense of cashin' all the chips,
Before I lost them all on a bad deal.
I made believe I was in a race,
Drove ten thousand miles in seven days,
While writing a book called ""Being A Free Man"".
Met more people than the president,
The good times came and the good times went,
And I learned how to ignore my hunger pangs.
I looked ahead to the open road, thought about the people and what they know,
And wrote a book called ""People Don't Know Nothin"".

Once I spent my last dime,
And counted the ratio of miles to time,
I looked up to my disdain and my surprise.
I had driven my car around the world,
Ended back in the town with the girl,
So I wrote a book called ""Life in Prison"".

I see that girl every now and then,
And we drink to having such good friends,
And apologize for the way it did not last.
Funny thing that it's all true,
And I'll always love November Blue,
But I turned her down for the beauty of the past.
November came and went,
Like a summer that I spent,
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes.

Than spread your gossip and speak what's untrue?
You go to church, see through your haughty eyes,
Go to your friends, and tell all your lies.
Go on over to your stupid social clique.
You religious hypocrites make me so sick.
You without sin, go ahead cast the first stone.
I didn't think so, so why don't you just go home.
You claim to be a leader.
You claim to make a stand.
But when your brother's fallen,
You won't even give a hand.
You claim to be so holy.
You claim to be so strong.

I know your motives are so wrong.
It don't mean a thing 'cause talk is cheap.
Your actions count, but your words you can't keep.
You think you're so righteous,
But I think you're a creep.
You're the kind of person
Who looks at others' sin.
And then spreads the word,
Forgetting your own within.
You go to church to see what's in the news,
So you can gossip, so you can lie,
So you can confuse.
See your brothers falling down all the time.
Instead of showing mercy you convict them of a crime.
You like to watch them as they fall on down.
Instead of helping them you push them to the ground.

You'll never make a stand.

There's girls who put out fanzines, others put on shows,
Yet they're not allowed to get out on the floor.

I beseech you, God to whom many sinners pray
From the depth of the dark abyss where my heart fell
Expelled I was from your tedious grace to the pits of hell
So can please cease to deplore my opposite, may only way

Till I saw the dreadful truths
of which man wouldn't know
I, degraded bearer of thy sacred light
- to which I never again will bow
When I rise to avenge myself with darkness
The anger of the damned shall flow
I was cast out by the retinue of angels weak
Shone to the few who me would seek
A rebel I was, radiant my glow, afar,
My wisdom fathomed by the morningstar

And when creation falls, you must build anew,
With nails that sting My hands -

Those songs whistled through white teeth do scuff the days

"WHISKEY LULLABY
Writers Bill Anderson, Jon Randall
RECORDED AS A DUET BY BRAD PAISLEY AND ALISON KRAUSS
She put him out like the burning end of a midnight cigarette. She broke his heart: He spent his whole life trying to forget. We watched him drink his pain away, a little at a time, But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind, Until the night: He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away her memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength he had to get up off his knees. We found him with his face down in the pillow, With a note that said: ""I'll love her till I die."" And when we buried him beneath the willow, The angels sang a whiskey lullabye. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la. The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself. For years and years, she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath. She finally drank her pain away, a little at a time, But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind. Until the night: She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. We found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life. We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullabye. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la.

An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune

No parachute, but keep on jumping

"We met on the beach amid rumours of war
Your head in your hand, what you saw you won't say
As the newspapers blew in the wind
I can see you're one of that kind
Who carry round a time bomb in their mind, no one knows
When you'll slip the pin
Rumours of war
Rumours of war
I see that your dress is torn at the edge
You were lost, intense, like a man on a ledge, waiting to jump
As the waves break over the shore
You say there's a storm that can't be delayed
And lately it seems to be comin' this way, you can hear it break
Like the slam of a door
Rumours of war
Rumours of war
You tell me, just look all around
At the past and the present, the cross and the crescent,
The signs and the planets are lining up like before
There are souls on fire in the day and the night
On the left and the right, in the black and the white
You can see it burn in the eyes of the rich and the poor

"The uprising
Is quickly approaching
So grab your weapons
And head into battle
This reign of terror will come to a halt
And what they saw were explosions in the sky
Your presence demeans what is common
Living by no consequence has ended
Someone must pay for what was done
Someone must pay for all the blood
Let's take it back
To a state of nature
Let's see what unfolds
With no authority
Coming of age

We 'bout to roll to the corner me and my crew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and get us some brew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and get some swishers too
So we can role a fat blunt and get perfed
Another fine day in this land I live
Oakland we're they don't give a shit and that's it
You know I'm sellin' they can split the profit 50 50
With this other brother who went in half with me
Now, first before we burst the move
We gotta sooth our nerves with the liquor
Then we don't bicker
We'll be relaxed ask your mama
This shit is like a war zone
Streets is hot like the Bahamas
But we will stay away from the drama
I'm wearin' my snipe, my arctic jacket with the wool like a llama
Then we had to pause like a comma
Cause someone got stuck and buck and family was outside with trama
We heard the shots from inside and went there when the gats go off
I hit the deckin' high
And a popo said they got their own time they lie
But you gotta give them credit they try
I see a mother cry and I'm wondering why
And my man said fuck it aint nothin' we can do
But to continue our mission down the block for the brew
And we out 

On our way we 'bout half way there
Children runnin' everywhere like they just don't care
The Muslim Bakery is like right between
And if I pass by with beer they will look at me mean
So I ducks in and gets my Final Call now
Cause still my brain gotta be well endowed and proud
The ambulances signals and glances
So let's hurry up and take no chances
Niggas step to us trying to rap like we got all the answers
In front of the store trying to work that slide ahead
The pant handlers they got no amateurs
Daily reminders of how I gotta find a way to come up
And sums up life along with the kids and a wife
But anyway
We pass the local grocery store
And you can be sure the meats and the products aint good no more
Some of it is from days before
I want it fresh and the clerk ain't my race so he stress
They doin' me in my community
Fuck it, we there
Aint enough for a 6 pack so we had to share
A nice little strole through the April spring air
We hide on shit so the nation don't see it there

I will be behind the wheel
Watchin' dotted yellow hexagrams
Stretch into the dark
Left hand surfin' on iced tinged winds
Chewin' up a cardboard box
Singin' at lung top, one stop
Left 'til I meet you in the concourse
St. Louie, encore, do we have a shot?
Caught, no dwellin' on the thought
What the hell we haven't got
So I'm headed from the dot to the spot
Where your plane touches down
For a six hour layover
Don't say a word, I found it on the map
Calculated it just a half a day to get from
Where you're not to where you will be
My hair is filthy, I'm drinkin' coffee
I can barely feel the trace
From the only time you kissed me on the face
Question mark, space
I know you're with me underneath the star-scape
Treadmill, pick up our pace
Head-start on a jet in a car chase
Is this the part where my heart breaks?
One asleep, one awake, back to back
'Cause you wouldn't turn towards me
Had me battlin' fractals, keeping track of all the chords
We created sound clash of swords back and forth
Couldn't poke through the sash
Slash through the plasterboard
You packing your passport, me on a crash course
To show you that I have the passion that you asked for
Floorin' the gas, tryin' a fast forward
Fifteen months, I'll see you once the sun shines through
The glass above the dashboard
The stars I see aren't even there
It's only light in the air

The stars I see aren't even there

It's only light in the air

Either on my second flight or already
All the way to my destination
Ridiculous that I could honestly expect you
Waitin' at the gate when I arrive
A sixteen hour drive

Goin' on now several months
As our obsession runs together
And whoever comes to have you, I'll be jealous of
And when above all else
You put her I'll know what it was
To feel so needed
Sorta wish that I was more of a romantic
And could give you back the utmost
But I've never seen it up close
From everything that I can tell
There are several possibilities
Maybe we're in love really
Maybe it's too early to really see
Maybe we're just searching for something
To hold onto amidst confusion and fragility
Maybe we've lost all sensibility
Will it become our 'Splendor In The Grass'?
When the facts have asserted themselves
And the memories pass into poetry and words that we tell
What only then can we be sure that we felt
Guess I prefer to be unhappy
Or weren't you looking at me
When my back became a wall?
Searched for your reflection
Saw exactly what you saw
Two kinds of different skin
Two minds exist within
Trying to just transcend all space and time
And lift their chin
And find some sense of purpose some sense of hope
Press my cheek against the window surface
We've been afloat
But now I'm nervous, has this been a joke?
We're landin' and it's time to close the envelope
Maybe I'll see you at the finish line
The stars I see aren't even there

You said that the last shall be first
Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth?
My whole life I had to worry about eatin'
I ain't have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come?
I'm coming back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son
And I don't want my waves following him, the streets swallowing him
And I don't want no hollows in him, his momma said she see his father in him
Hope it's the good things, 'til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates 'cause I know you've forgiven what I've done
I'm your son, do I have the keys to get in?


Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever's on your plate
Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven 'cause I couldn't get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back 'cause these stripes ain't free
We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse, they wasn't for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain't from around here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys

You know you need to preach how the pyramids of Giza
Alone condemn Easter
Instead of sniffing lines, popping thongs in Ibiza, Ether

Verbs and spices, giving life out to the lifeless
Giving Christ out to the Christ-less

Devils who used to laugh at me bow to me internationally
Rappers I gave birth to shot at the God, blasphemy
Told these motherfuckers to never Jimmy DeGrassi me

Disrespectful views on original Jews
The chosen people of God getting slandered and abused

Did you sleep much at all?

The first one was lonesome and the second one was clear
The first one was familiar as the second drew near
She walked to the window to expose the light
Her breath hung in silence like the fog in the night
The sun raised its head from behind the frost
She sat down by the stove with her long legs crossed
Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep fine?
Did you sleep much at all?

The first one was ancient but the second was a gun
The first one was laughin before the second was done

Her mouth it was movin but the words tried to stay
Her posture was thin and her tears they were tall
Like the picture of the forest in the fire in the hall

Did you sleep fine?
Did you sleep much at all?
All night I heard two voices from out here in the hall
The first it was singing and the second dressed in red
The first one was hungry and the second was well fed
My struggles were hard and my journey was long
My food was your beauty and my water your song
I returned for your voice and your precious melody
I heard them both but you sang not for me
Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep fine?
Did you sleep much at all?
All night I heard two voices from out here in the hall
The first was a flower and the second was a train
The first issued warning and the second brought the rain
Day is breaking, its time for me to leave
Each breath I'm taking reminds me to grieve
You've proven false but another will be true
Walking tall in the darkness the whole night through
Will you sleep well?
Will you sleep fine?
Will you sleep much at all?
All night you'll hear two voices from out there in the hall
The first will be a mirror and the second one a dove
The first will be an echo and the second silent love
Will you sleep well?

the huge full moon is casting long shadows before my eyes as
I'm slowly strolling over the wall, approaching another tower.

have heard seem likely to happen, now. what have I come here for?

my warning is a riddle, and the final answer belongs to you, master.

Jane and I were having solstice
Now we need a place to stay""
And her Christ-loving uncle
Watched his wife hang Mary on a tree
He watched his son hang candy canes
All made with red dye number three
He told his niece, ""It's Christmas eve
I know our life is not your style""
She said, ""Christmas is like solstice
And we miss you and it's been awhile""

Sat together at the table
Finding faith and common ground
The best that they were able
And just before the meal was served
Hands were held and prayers were said
Sending hope for peace on earth
To all their Gods and Goddesses
The food was great, the tree plugged in
The meal had gone without a hitch
Till Timmy turned to Amber and said
""Is it true that you're a witch?""
His mom jumped up and said
""The pies are burning,"" and she hit the kitchen
And it was Jane who spoke, she said
""It's true, your cousin's not a Christian""
""But we love trees, we love the snow
The friends we have, the world we share
And you find magic from your God
And we find magic everywhere""

Only pumpkin pies are burning

""It's Christmas and your daughter's here""

Saw his own son tug his sleeve, saying
""Can I be a pagan?"" dad said

Living a life they say is free from sin
Then they judge another person by the colour of their skin
I feel ashamed of myself I'm a white human being
Surrounded by suckers to afraid to be seeing
There ain't such a thing called superior race
And there ain't nothing special 'bout colour of your face
You've got a one way ticket to a dead end street

Media pollution is a very bad solution
Hypocriticat hype is your only contribution
So leave us alone and give your brothers some space

"Can you hear us when we scream
Of our burdened beliefs ending all sanity?
The wrong to right indeed I wonder
The promise to break instead to suffer
Can you see us when we bleed
With wounds a mile deep spraying profusely?
The pain to feel indeed it grows
The tables are turned instead to fuel
Something inside us fades
When weakness turns into trying
We all must carry on
For the slaughtered and the dying
Can you feel us when we kill
Everything that you have built?

The war machine springs to life, opening one eager eye
Focusing it in the sky as 99 red balloons go by

To worry, worry, super scurry, call the troops out in a hurry

99 knights of the air ride super high tech jet fighters

Then windin' down that old familiar pathway
I heard my mother call at set of sun
Come home, come home it's suppertime

Were woven around suppertime
When my mother used to call
From the backsteps of the old homeplace
Come on home now son it's suppertime
Ah but I'd loved to hear that once more
But you know for me time has woven the realization of
The truth that's even more thrillin' and that's when
The call come up from the portals of glory
To come home for it's suppertime when all

The crows are round their nests.

To all those souls at rest.

Watching the briars grow.

And I remember when you was a little boy
You used to love music
And you loved to just play
And I always knew that you would make it
As long as you sticked with the lord
'cause God is here to do the things that fail
And I knew he have all power, he's peace
And I knew that you would do good

So I'm prayin' for you and your group
That I know that god'll always will bless you

And I know one day

You came a long way
You went the wrong way
But then God see fit to put in my heart
To bring you back the right way
And to tell you the right things to do
And so far, you have prospered through your music
Because you been playin' music for a long time
And you played all the way through church
I always tell you that god
Was gonna bless you one day
And God have blessed you
He have blessed you with sound and music
Through your heart, through your finger
Through your mind
And through the love that you share with other people
And it only come from being well mannered
And respect
And regardless of what song you sing
You can sing gospel, you can sing rock and roll
God gave you that song to sing
And every song he gave you so far
It became a hit
And you've been blessed with these songs
So you keep on singing these songs
And you keep on praisin' the lord
And for each thing that you do
You thank him
Because without god, you can't do nothing

For where God has brought you from
He has brought you from a mighty long way
You has been born with a special gift with a message
And I don't want you to forget
Where God has brought you from
You has been singing ever since you was a little boy
By listening to sounds of music as a baby
And listening to a reecord player
You would pick up the sound and repeat what you hear
At that time, we noticed that you had a gift by god
But you been through a hard time struggling
Through your career
But you kept pressin' on
You never gave up on your dream
And I thank God for the effort that you have made
You have been obedient
You have been singing in the church at an early age
And you have been honoring your parents for a long time
And you have learned how to respect people
But I want you to continue to do that
Don't never forget where you came from
And don't never forget what your father have taught you
He have taught you how to attend church on Sunday morning
And how to treat your brothers and sisters
And he have taught you how to share with people
I want you to always remember that God loves you
And I love you too
Always remember to do good
Do right and be great
And the lord will bless you
Because the lord is real

Amen, I truly do think the lord is real
And I think you know, if it wasn't for him
We wouldn't be where we at today
We wouldn't be able to do any singing, anything

And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candle light, still burning bright
Through the Sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragnance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
Then I long for my Indiana home

Back home again in Indiana

"So you're tired of hearing us moan and complain,
Just 'cos you don't feel it,
Don't mean there's no pain.
Some are brought up and let down,
Then run through the course,
While they're able to fuck us and feel no remorse.

Oh Oh Oh! 
Well you've turned on your own,
Kicked dirt in our faces,
We're left with no money, no work, no paces,
Just think what you'd do

While reality's waiting, you're taking up space

Are you happy? Are you proud?

His excess of light is searching for your darkness
He is the tyrant
There's one only law for him ...to be pure
He comes from above
He died a thousand times and put his hand in mine
He hails victory and loss
I hear him coming every single day
And the queen desires me
To use some gentle entertainment to him
If it be her will...
And I have no choice - Plus de chemin nulle part
I should kill for him - I will kill for me
He shall bring me the anti-matter
No compassion, never
Never kneel before anyone
The wound is so deep
Them - Us - Against
I sacrify my right arm to the golden rain
And I know it's a sign
I know the end is near
One black cancer to make the children close their eyes
Abime, Abyssus, Propator !
The red earth is trickling down on the wall
Its blood is running off my veins
Et tandis que le grand feu devore le monde la matiere
Je prends ma place a la porte du cercle divin
Antagonize the world - Incest and crime
Humiliation of the whore - Cum, suck me child
Vengeance is mine - Murder is wine
Purification through the forever more

All mothers are devorating the babies
While children fornicate with animals
And fathers die of overdose

To guide the flocks of the ships home one by one
Grey beneath the Arctic sun
Or the glow of Northern Lights
I see you have his photograph
His eyes are watching for dangers fore or aft
Trading days beneath the sun
For the cold and wintry nights of the Murmansk run
He never did come home to you
It's long forgotten, a childhood dream or two
But something of the cold got through
And it lingers in your eyes
On days like these you hear the wind
And feel the chill of the ice floes closing in
Trading days beneath the sun
For the cold and wintry nights of the Murmansk run
Save our souls, river of darkness over me
Save our souls, lost on the dark uncharted sea
Now you hide yourself from view
You seem to find it an easy thing to do
Trading days beneath the sun
For the cold and wintry nights of the Murmansk run
Save our souls, river of darkness over me

Well you wake up in the morning on Hester street
And run to the factory, You can't afford to be late
Working every morning, every evening, every day
For your money, Yet there's nothing to save
Watching your life pass by the window
Feeling it all run through your hands
Counting the thousands behind in the lines
Waiting time for their chance
From Ellis Island, day after day
From Ellis Island, dreams slip away
Meanwhile from the market come the cries
Of every tongue and every nation
Refugeless refugees
Faces from the endless plains of Russia
Blonde Norwegian, dark Croatian
Songs in sad minor keys
Feeling the heat inside the fumace
Trying to make that break away
Reaching their hands for a grip
On the edge just to slip back again
From Ellis Island, day after day
From Ellis Island, dreams slip away
Ah well I've heard it said
If you just use your head
You can make your fortune here
One lucky break and that's all it would take
But it never seems to be near
Another day, another ship pulls into harbor
And the crowd spills down the gangway
Clutching their suitcases tight
Blinking in the sunlight at the door of the new world
They hold the handrail
With all the post thrown behind
Caught in between now and forever
Wondering just what lies ahead
Each one is waiting and hoping
The door will be open to them

Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music

I told everyone and all of my friends
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now:

She's hanging off the chopper
And no one's gonna stop her
Don't try and call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground
If you could just believe what you can not see
Well that may be, she may as well be
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now:

She's hanging off the chopper
And nothing's gonna stop her
Don't even call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground



Woah, she's flying around in her head

Woah, Punishing what's left of the WWF
If that's what you want
That's what you get
You want Danger Woman
That's what you want
That's what you get
That's what you want,
You want Danger Woman
Well she's fighting a crime
That's all in her mind
At the Kareoke showdown
Don't try to understand her

"They said your cheating heart would make me cry
And like a fool I gave it a try
I should've listened when they told me so
Many, many tears ago.
But I could not believe the things they said
Because my heart over ruled my head
I should've listened when they told me so
Many, many tears ago.
I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was only foolin' myself.
I know it's too late for a brand new start
'Cause I have cried you out of my heart
I should've listened when they told me so
Many, many tears ago.

"Baby, when I found out you were lyin'
Playin' around and connivin'
Undesired tears I was cryin'
`Cause sugar coated lies I was buyin'
I was just a backseat driver in a car of love
Goin' wherever you take me
Don't know why I put up with the pain
`Cause nobody else could make me
You got me goin' 
You got me goin'  Hey, hey 
You got me goin' 
You got me goin'  Hey, hey

Man, I drank more than I could hold

You know you want to take my soul

Where can I hide
Who can I talk to

Dreams of you fucking me all the time

Come back, move in, mess my place
Chest infect me, waste my days
'Cause I know you love to drive me up the wall
I know you love to drive me up the wall
I wanna bring you home myself

And I'm so impatient when you're not mine
I just want to catch up on all the lost times
And I'll say I'm sorry if I sound sordid

"Put on your best new dress,
And let your hair hand down
Leave behind that kitchen mess,
We're going out on the town
I'll put my new boots on,
Brush off my hat
And like the wind we're gone
Can't do better than that
And then we'll dance the blues,
Dance the blues,
Dance the blues away
Tonight is yours and mine
Like old times,
Lets dance the blues away
I asked you for your hand
Seven yeas gone by
Back when we used to dance
Let's give it one more try
Each day brings new romance
That our hearts can't hide
Under the moon you'll dance
In my arms tonight

Things can go wrong
I've got one and only girl
And we're still going strong",Folk

The sun will fall across the plain

The frost ravages the lanes

You're so happy that you're free
And if you're no better now than you've ever been,
You owe me an apology
You owe me an apology
Before the dusk falls to dark
I'll have you banished from my mind
I just need a moment's rest to make it mine
Before the moment turns to cold
With our last drawn line
Beyond the rusted sin of gloat

With diamonds and jewels profound
Well, I'd rather know that I had salvation
Than to know my reward would be Satan's jewel crown

His love set me free, He made me His own

See, ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm making it known cause I just want the world to know
I'm paying my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'ma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
""Juicy"" had us feeling like we was from New York
And that's real shit blazed the Philly
It's summertime shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks?
My nigga Nas told me money make the world go round
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for Love LA
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back


Public Enemy and N.W.A is on my boom box, had to say
Today was a good day, had the hood buzzin'
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothin'
Everybody's first bootleg was Boyz 'n the Hood
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood
When the cars ride by with the boomin' system
Two door Mustang and the roof was missing
Every girl at ya school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin' all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with OPP, then bring Naughty in
They say it never rain in southern California, Tony Toni lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky


Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the honey's
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say whoa!
Every thing full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name,
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talking 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me


See, Mary J. I want you to understand you paved the way 
I'm givin' homage ",Hip-Hop

He runs to meet you
Rehearsed a first line
It's left him, thank goodness

That people know the next steps
To and through with letters

Except his and he's old
And I've grown to accept
That people know the next steps
Upstream and our stars
Under one sky
A cabin once stood
Where we now stand

The neck it is warped and the saddle is through
I wonder if sweet music ever was played
From the hands of a boy to a girl in the shade
From this rickety ghost of a song

A dollar for anything here on this quilt
A price tag for hands from which all things are built
A blanket of voices speak pleasure in shame
Flowers of plastic and fruit of the same
A basket of nothing at all

And cover the whole lot with good gasoline
And burn it for all that I care for the past
And rid mother earth of what never should last
And give her the present of ash

"Reaching out
Don't know what you'll find
Always reaching out
Hoping you'll find love
'Cause when it comes
You'll hold on tight
But wonder will it ever survive
How long will it take
For love to stand by you?

'Cause everybody needs
Someone to love
And everybody needs
Someone they can trust and know

'Cause people may come
And people will go away
They can cause you disappointment and pain
They come as your friend
Though some in the end
They can leave you disappointed
You're in doubt
You've been down that road
Met many people
Who have left you cold
They pretend they're on your side
But soon draw their knives
Gotta learn to figure out
Just who's right and wrong for you


Gotta learn to read the signs
Gotta learn who's wrong from right
Gotta learn who is your friend
And will be there to the end for you
Gotta learn to live your life
Gotta learn to walk with pride
Gotta keep that in your mind
Gotta know deep down inside who's true

You run to greet me, the river runs so long
As all pride amongst the masses disappears and drifts away

In the anger of the morning, screaming o'er the Southern hills
Come the enterers of hope to seek my guidance and they wail

Silently the rain commands us, ""run before you drown""
As the moonless night approaches, I reflect upon my thoughts
When the moment of refusal seems to partiss

"Widow's Walk
Words and music Chris Foster
The storm clouds draped on the horizon
An his love climbed the stairs so she could see
On the second story perch of her protection
She blew him a kiss as he wandered off to sea.
The captain told him be on board by morning
The catch is running now, he knew he had to go
In about a day she will see him coming home
Through the inlet where the boats go to and fro
I will wait for my love in the morning
I will wait for my love in the day.
From on top of the roof from my widow's walk
I'll be wishing all your stormy clouds away
Sailors dance on mother natures cool clear waters
Spend the springtime of their lives in her fold
Sailors songs have been sung for thousands of years
But the widows story's rarely ever told
On cold dark nights she'll linger up ---- to her rooftop
Grasp the wooden rail with boney shaky hands
The salty air caresses worried cheeks of sorrow
As she ask her God to help understand
I will wait for your love in the sunshine
I will wait for your love in the rain
From on top of the roof from my widow's walk
I will wait for my love to come again
Solo
The time has come and gone for him to be home now
Another sleepless night upon her breast
Maybe it's the season or maybe some bad weather
But either way I will not get my rest.
I will wait for my love in the springtime
I will wait for my love in the fall
From on top of the roof from my widows walk
I'll wait until I hear your angel call.

"I've made a tough decision
We must make sure that mankind will survive
They' ve taken everything, but this sacred promise
Though this might be the last day for me with you
I have to make you sleep and dream of someone else
Seal your past, so you won't be able to tell them
I open a rift into the unknown
And take a silent walk, through time
Where ends this colorful journey
Will I ever see the curtain fall
The dream is strongar than ever
There is unchained magic in the air
It's right before me on a transparant plane
Juggling with a liquid substance
Is it a final test I have to break through
Which way am I supposed to chose
Suddenly I'm able to hear my own steps
But still unable to sort out what's far and what's near
And when the unseen walls I pass becomes concrete
Is it all in vain, am I about to spend my time with time",Metal

At the crossroads fair I'll be surely thereAnd I'll dress in my Sunday clothesAnd I'll try sheep's eyes, and deludhering liesOn the heart of the nut-brown Rose.No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yokeThough with rust my plow turns brown,Till a smiling bride by my own firesideSits the Star of the County Down.",Folk

"I stalk my prey at night
I have the look of death in my eye
I follow your every move
Waiting for you with my killing tools
Let me taste your bittersweet flesh
Let me show you what life brings next
Teeth sinks into flesh, closing in on death
Taste the blood of the dead
I lay you down on the ground
I strip you to the core, blood will soon spit from every pore
I watch in ecstasy, my victims caressed by fear
Naked skin, begs me to commit another sin
I take another walk down the path of Flesh
Looking for a fresh kill
Skinned alive
Body limbs rearranged
soul cleansed by victims weep
I will die in hell",Metal

"I feel the dark embrace the light
I see the black engulf the white
I can sense it, life denying
Take me from this cold fucking world
Life defying
...Hating everything
Life declining...
Seems there's no time for me
Cursing my own destiny
Sorrow flies on black wings
Riding the cursed wings of grief
Silence!
Hear sorrow laughing
Hear joy crying
Ride the black wings of sorrow
Silence!
Hear death screaming
Hear life dying
After going through
the darkest nightmares
I could only trust my self.
For the ones who loved me...
...will be happy to hate me
Don't just stand there!
My black tree withers
Take me away to the forest of believes.
Where the roots will rest
and I can have... serenity!
I want to feel the black rivers water
The current gliding me...
...Towards... Eternity.

Ripping, biting and cutting my flesh
Destroying this shell,

I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder
You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children
Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago
Michelangelo
Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning
And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing
And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So Far below

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk about you crying
For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago
Michelangelo
Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender
And could you hear me calling out your name
Well I guess that I will never know

Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping
And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago

Still swinging his axe

His joints are clogged with rust

My youth is slipping away
Safe in monotony

My youth is slipping
My youth is slipping away
Cold wind blows off the lake

Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower

See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth

Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' ""We don't love them hoes""

Would it be worth it to hear you crying""

Searching for a closure
Poisoned tentacles from the past

Peaking an all time low

A banished vanished presence

The uttermost shame is its essence
The septic transforms the shellshocked and blind
A nightmare released a terrible disease
Lurking behind a thin wall of sleep
The jail-bars of a stigmatized keep
Across the crumbling layers

Beyond matter the untouchable scatter

But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden,
At last I've found my baby here in jail""
""It was just five years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
T'was then I bowed to take his ring
And his gold watch and his chain
Then the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden,
The county laid his daddy in the grave""
""I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden,
If that will get my baby out of jail""
Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray:
""I'll go bring your darling baby to your side""
Two iron gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling,
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
""I'm not in your town to stay,""
Said a lady old and gray
""I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Yes warden,
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail""",Country

When the days get rainy and the nights get long
When you get that feelin you were born to lose
Starin' at your ceiling feelin' the blues
When there's so much trouble that you want to cry
When your love has crumbled and you don't know why
When your hopes are fading and they can't be found
Dreams have left you waiting friends let you down
Well just remember I love you
And it'll be all right
Just remember I love you
More than I can say just remember I love you
Maybe all your blues will fade away
When you need a lover and you're down so low
And you start to wonder but you never know
When it seems like sorrow is your only friend
Knowing that tomorrow you'll feel this way again
When the blues come callin' at the break of dawn
When the rain keeps fallin' but the rainbow's gone
When you feel like cryin' but the tears won't come
Then your dreams are dyin' when you're on the run
Just remember I love you

Try to get away, you'll be fine
You've only got one chance left
On your knees, sip that wine, chew the wafer

Am I alive or dead
People screaming, can I be dreaming
Am I confused
I can't tell whether this is heaven...or hell
Won't they live, and the sound of a silver bell
Up on my feet
I think it's over now
The air is stiff
The smell of death is everywhere
It's all around
But I won't submit to death
You can go with the rest of the world it's all death

I just caressed a memory and took it from my mind it fell around me like a gentle glow
A smile of sadness curved my lips my thoughts rushed back in time
To when you loved me long and warm ago
The breeze that cooled our faces is now an icy wind
It chills me to the bone and makes me know
That nothing is forever and everything must end
And be just a part of long and warm ago

We talked of holding hands when we grew old
But you left and now tomorrow like yesterday is gone lost in long and warm ago

The water of life, mentally rinsing me, physically drenching me

But I need you for survival
And when you fall on my community
I run outside to properly
Greet you
Let it rain, take my pain, I'm glad to meet you

Every drop hits me, fills me
With an unmeasurable amount of security
Knowing my God acknowledges me
As if each drop of rain is aimed toward me

The goal of this rain I feel is spiritual
Saw through the eyes of the inflicted people
Their eyes are hard as a million tombstones
Marked with the names of the millions of kin thrown
To the dust that gave them their colored skin
Fade to black is the scene they're embalmed in
The rain many nights have witnessed her
Receiving the sperm of a brother into a sister
And blessed that life to guaranteed existence
A conscious baby for a black resistance

And reminds us of a spiritual solution
And reminds us of an unnatural supernatural solution

Would you rather be in these streets
Scrappin' and shootin' with these niggas?
Or somewhere with a blunt in your mouth
Getting ya dick sucked by a bad ass bitch?
Oh yeah that's me babe
Now super socka with gin and Seagrams and sweet and sour
Are sippin', suckin' on my sausage gave the stripper some power
Limpin' every time she get lead, you come poppin' that shit
Then whimper like a little puppy when your walls get hit
Suckin' ya thumb I make ya cum one by one
Till we both get up the mountain and just pop like guns

I'ma bang you till the sun peaks so you in the dark

Then lick you for 30 more 'cus I'm a nympho's dream

But follow me and let me drop my kids off at pumpkin's house""

And will coat your whole hide with fluoride
When I smack that ass don't forget ya chips
When I slide between ya titties better wet ya lips
I'm the imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight even though they are dikes
When she grabbed the mic, it felt like she had two tongues
Ky'ed the  and then stroked the two buns
It was fun and all but one of my balls was stuck up in the sugar walls
Y'all had to pull and push man the fuckin' push was pull
Mixed with Belvedere and Red Bull shit
I took a bump with a pimp and thought what the fuck?
And tried to stick my other nut up in her but

Sweaty palms itchin' with them high beams on
And when ya movin' too much niggas be gettin' jealous
They see police on the corner and won't even tell us
So it's do or die, you can stay true or lie
Now we know you and I is two bird that don't fly
Together, separate mine from ya funky style
Niggas be gossipin' while I be watchin' money pile
Smile now and get crossed up
Take yo clientele and raise the cost up
Have yo ass tossed up
Switchin' all ya yea to fetti
The big dog is on the block them lil' puppies ain't ready
Bow wow yippy-yay bow down to the Bay
Hey why you sell yay, it's the only way

When they get scrilla please give me a holla
'Cause I was servin' up a short one for some of they dollars
With nickels and dimes I'm gettin' mine, even scrap iron
Trade for jewels, new clothes, and the strap firin'
Without jammin' and I'm addin' to my throw aways
Def niggas in the cut ridin' like stowaways
Everybody got yea in they draws
Hit a fence on the Feds cause they be squeezin' ya balls
And when they leave it's time to set up shop
And if ya shortstop, ain't no mercy nigga bop, bop
Drop down and make ya way up out the Bomb-Bay

I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
With just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad
Just one night of
Moonlight, with you there beside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby
Oooh I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're makin me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I wanna be with you
In spite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad
All I want is
Moonlight, with you there inside me
All night, doin it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby
Hook
I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal you roll, I lick
And we can go flying into ecstasy
Oh darlin' you and me
Light my fire
Blow my flame
Take me, take me, take me away

"Did you ever write my name with a fountain pen
In your books or on your desk
or did you tell your friends
That I was someone special
Did you ever lie awake the entire night
Glowing in the dark with no sheets or light
Thinking that I was someone special
You got me running
running late at night
trying to find you
And I started thinking
thinking all the time
But what could I do
I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery
Did you change your clothes did you hesitate
walking back and forth, always being late
Cause I was someone special
Did you ever take a shower did you wash your face
making up the bed thinking just incase
That I was someone special
You got me running
running late at night
trying to find you
And I started thinking
thinking all the time
But what could I do
I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you

"Is there a place in your heart?
For someone like me, someone you barely know
Ive got so much to learn, that I know
Im not perfect but I want to make you feel
Something pure, something sweet
Something real, something deep
All I want is just a try
To show you whats inside of me
Ive been waiting so long
To get to know you a little more
I know Im stressed out but itll pass
Once you know me you will feel
Something pure, something sweet
Something real, something deep
All I want is just a try
To show you whats inside of me
The more I read you the more I know
That you could be the one I was waiting for
I hope itll work out this time

"Es por decirlo que a este canto doy mi voz
soy nacido en Buenos Aires
con tango robado a la imaginacin
o al recuerdo no lo s.
Y aunque burles este intento
que pretende demostrarte
Que no soy yo quin olvidar el pasado
y a esos hombres que han dado a parir identidad.
Sopladores y compinches
soadores de la fiesta
nocheros de mercaderas que hoy
se abanican por doquier
y aunque falta poco tiempo
para que el siglo se muera
supermercados plastificau no
no me dan fiau; porque de la baja soy.
Me desnudo en este espiche
sin mscaras ni caretas
no curro y me escurro de que algn turro habr
que me busqu de revs
soy maldito porque siento
como pocos hay que sientan
de mis entripados me voy liberando, cantando
y hoy por hoy historiando, en camino al ms all.",Metal
"Baby it's strange how things go down
How every circle comes around
Nobody wins, everyone pays
You and I standing here again
Thinkin' about what might have been
Ready to go our separate ways

One more night
We could have been in love
Just one more night
We should have been in love
I guess we asked more than we ever gave
But I would give the world
Baby, if I could save
What we have for one more night
Funny, I just can't get it clear
Where are we gonna go from here?
You without me, me without you
Somehow I pray the days won't end
'Cause when the darkness comes again
I don't believe I'll make it through

If we could make it right
If I could turn back time for you and me
Baby, it wouldn't have to be

"I look back now, girl, no tomorrow's dreams
Distant things are happening, not as bad as they seem
Don't put off tomorrow for what today might bring
I'd be satisfied now to gain one single thing
Don't look away now, girl, things are looking bright
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
I want my baby, tonight baby, I can't wait no longer
Here now baby
I give my heart and feeling of distress
Trying to ignore her pain, all the happiness
Anything you want girl, I will give complete
I'd do anything, baby, to overcome defeat
And don't say tomorrow come, it don't belong to anyone
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby

Time is rollin' on and I, I'm the one who's wrong
I'm the one should be movin' on, oh babe
A heart can only stand so much
It needs to touch someone, someone
So, it's up to you, do you love me too?
I get so confused when you throw excuses my way, oh baby
I need your love to hang on
Please tell me that love ain't gone forever

Where is my rainbow, where is my sunny day?

Where is the fantasy, who took the dream away?

Where is my star, who took the dream away?
Baby, every word you say always seems touche
So that I'll be makin' my way back to you
Please tell me this love for you is really shared by two

Where is my rainbow, where is my sunny day

Where is the fantasy, who took my dream away

Where is my star? Who took the dream, who took the dream away?
Tried to find the reasons, patience wears thin
I tried to slow the seasons
But I know some day I will win, I will win
There's a star for everyone who's lost
There's a star for everyone who's lost
There's a star for everyone
Where is my rainbow, where is my sunny day?
Who took my star away, who took the dream?
Where is my rainbow, where is my sunny day?
Who took my star away, who took the dream?

"Feeling shell shocked
Barbed wire, I'm torn apart
Warheads dead ends, parties only we attend
The runaround, out of ground
Your goddamned sympathy wears me down
I've spent my life
Reaching out to empty air
Seeking faster all the time
But no one seems to care
Concrete breaks my fall
Troubles, ten stories tall
Sunshine, I can't sleep
Just like my life on TV
Church bells drown me out
My ears ring your favorite sound
I've spent my life
Reaching out to empty air
Seeking faster all the time
But no one seems to care
Clench my fists to strands
That really don't exist
I try not to fool myself
But still I can't resist
I can't resist
I've spent my life
Reaching out to empty air
Seeking faster all the time
But no one seems to care
Clench my fists to strands
That really don't exist
I try not to fool myself
But still I can't resist
Blood born my loss
Nailed to more than just a cross
Driven hard, brick fence
My twenty first second chance
Shell shocked, barbed wire
Warheads, your god damned sympathy
Concrete ten stories tall
Ten stories tall, ten stories tall
Feeling shell shocked
Empty air

"It's goin' down tonight, you know I gots to go get fitted
Hit the mall to get it, then I stop to get my hair
Twisted up in pony tails
Then sell a bill, back to the grain
And let my peoples know, you know it's goin' down tonight
Merry livin'
I got the 4-1-1 on the bumpin'
We ridin' we them heat, as if they funk
And them we dumpin'
I'm slumpin' in the meantime
My speakers is jumpin' up out they box
I see these broads choosin', man they sprung on my Shirly locks
Ugh, made the block
And they was all up on my bumper
Tryin' to pull me over
But now I gets a nothin' when I'm sober
Hit the gas and smoked it up, smashed off, I'm outtie
Bendin' corners, laughin' 'cause I left they car cloudy
Went to my partna house and they was postin', splittin', Vegas
Bet 5 dollas a game on Mat and 95 on Sega
Taggin' out the room, fools layin' on the ground
They better have some get back 'cause tonight it's goin' down


It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it goes down
It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it goes down

Closed up shop on the Sega, now we slammin' bones
Up in my hood, it's on, we make a casino up out yo' home
Head up, I sets 'em down fast for the stash
Yellin' ""stand up!"" when you pass
Turn over your bones and give me your cash
I hit the store with the money I won to get me a 4-0
A double O on the scene, I'm a O-G on the ink fo' sho'
I get twisted up in knots, ?per? straight sloppy
Prize breaders on my nuts and haters want to knock me
Can't understand how deep I get
When I split this real on real da real
Straight up out they heels due
In a minute we'll still talk
Boots stompin', outta my head
To the womp, and get my knees dirty
When I'm stinkin', I'm on da dots for Thompson
Side bettin', Little Joe in the doe
Now watch me roll
I let 'em go and watch that double duece lock up fo' sho'
I talk static, clown
Walkin' around & makin' my rounds
Snatchin' my money up off the ground
'Cause tonight it's goin' down


Shot to the house to get dressed, it's finally night fall
Jumped in my 7-4, smashed it, 'cause I'm tight why'all
Checkin' to see if the tape was on the passenger seat
I need some heat
The only way I'm gon' creep
Late night through these faulty streets
Hit the block & seen the whole crew on the corner
Smellin' that aroma, talkin' about the bump and comin' up on her
Super fast, sumpin' cool
You know how we do it
Touch 'em wit some game
And fill 'em wit some dick fluid
We hit then store, it's about 30 playas bailin' in
Give me some see & be	, some Hennessy, & Sequels Gin
Let me squeeze but no chasin', fool we straight lacin'
Jumpin' and mobbin', punchin' 'til the both of us playas racin'
We pulls up and see 'em posted outside
Gettin' gone
I'm in the zone, ready to take me somethin' home
Wall to wall breaders, top notch, it's mean, it's goin' down
At this bump I found
Tonight fool, it's goin' down

Now we've had enough, everybody wants to be tough

Instead of trying to be above

I figure still I hustle, tussle with the fool at school
The one that Momma sold my sneakers, thought she says he's freakin' her
Had the doubt until I caught 'em, then I fought 'em, then she slapped me
Hollered at me talkin' 'bout I messed up her ten dollars
Goddamn! Drug dealers dealin' to the kiddies
Livin' in the city ain't no pity on the itty-bitty
We try to cry, but still they all die
I try to speak to the youth, and the truth is they all high
What can I say but watch your back, youngster
As I sit and wonder, my other brother's steadily goin' under
It's like a curse, and it hurts 'cause it's worse
Momma's crazy 'cause her baby's in a hearse

Your way of life was bright
And full of superiority
Taking possession of the crown and the throne
You were caned patricide
Winged by snakes
Which raised from your shoulders
They were the sign of treason
They were the gift of kiss
Fed by human brains

Night after night

Transformed your substantiality
Into demon form
For thousand years the ruler of the earth
Menaced for second by saviors

By the massacre of the innocents

It sinks to the bottom, in oceans of rain
The cure is so clear, the blood is astray

I hate myself, and I want you to die

That a silence could end with no sound
Like the silent movie era, like with snow
Like when Sal's burned down
Well yeah, there was noise but nothing to mark the passing on
Of that great unspoken chance we had found
Where the night's end came well-trod and familiar
Like the Charlie Chaplin walk that fades to black
And there wasn't anyone trying to sell their souls
They were only trying to buy them back
They were only trying to buy them back
Well yeah, there was a Sal
He walked with bulging pockets 'round town
Either he was up to no good
Or he just got excited watching things burn down
Well, I guess he got the idea, if you hold a chunk of gold in your hand now
For once in your life you can throw some weight around
And Sal, your slimeball sell-out, how can we blame you
We all want something to put our fingers on
And you'll never know the true throne that you've lost
Till the vinyl barstools are gone
Till the vinyl barstools are gone
If you toss around some words you might say that
Sal was carrying a torch for the mob
But the mob's gone too, yeah the only sign of them left
Is on every screen at the Multiplex and we go there no prob hey
'Cause there ain't no cowboy's in this Connecticut town
No, not anymore, no, not since Sal's burned down
Once you dip your tin cup down in the muse's watering hole
Or pioneer a new patch of common ground
Then you'd lie on your time-traveled bedroll
Quite amazed at the expansive terrain

Be just like your dad lad
Follow in the same tradition
Never go astray and stay an honest lovin' son.

Commanded I was branded in a plastic vac'
Surrounded and confounded by statistic facts.
Tried to keep me in but jumped out of my skin in time
I saw through the lies and read the alibi signs
So I left my home I'm really on my own at last
Left the trodden path and separated from the past.

Collecting and selecting independent views
Knowing and I'm showing that a change is due.

Hating me, right, waiting me, right

Perusing them soon but recollections still restricted
My mind talks and talks, smoke, fire and brimstone
Telling me we had our fun but it's over in dim tones.
And all our sins showing in the heat of the moment
So potent till the goading get going and now it's growing
And you rolling and throttling, falling like roses,
Swollen and growing in the blast
The throne with dishonor to close up my past.

Never look again
So much to hide
For fear that he has sinned
He's lost all self control

He feels he needs no reason at all

Wondering what is right or wrong
Nothing left but life - to lose
Faithful to his God for so long

Fear inside eyes - screams but no reply

Witness his world decay

All hope for peace is lost

Our Maritimes are lovely and our prairies give us hay
You might think you Yankees are better than us Canucks
But we don't need no microchips inside our hockey pucks
We know that you got Disney world and you keep it very
clean
But we don't have Bob Dole and we can drink when we're
nineteen
We might watch your TV shows for hours and hours and hours
We'll give you Alan Thicke, but Shania Twain is ours
CHORUS
We're proud to be Canadian
We're awfully nice to strangers, our manners be our curse
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian
We won't say that we're better, it's just that we're less worse
Your beer is not too tasty and you weather can't be beat
We all fly south in the wintertime to escape the snow and sleet
We're pleased to say that we've enjoyed all your southern
charms
But we get sunburnt we exercise the right to bear our
arms
CHORUS
Alanis Morissette she
is our latest pride and joy
She used to sing
about high school
dances and chasin'
after boys
Now she's fed up
and about as angry
as can be
She's got one hand in
her pocket and the
other's in gaurd for
thee

My father is an engineer my brother drives a hack
My sister takes in washin' and the baby bolls a jack
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'

I've done a lotta wanderin' early and late
From New York City to the Golden Gate
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'

Been a working on a railroad been a working on a farm
But all I got to show for it is a muscle on my arm
And it looks like I'm never gonna cease my wanderin'

"I parked the car, I went inside
I left you there, I don't know why
But I wish I'd taken you in with me
I was hanging out with my pals
I swear I didn't hear you shout
But if I did I'd have been there
And you'd still be here with me
Wake up from this dream
I'm so upset that I could scream
How could this happen to me?
Who could've done such a thing
An evil deed that was in vain
Why did they take you from me?
And I was going home that night
When I received a fright
I saw that you were gone, oh, I could cry
Where are you now?
I wonder who is your new owner
I still like to sing these songs you used to play
I wish you'd come back to me
Make it how it used to be
But that will never happen
So now someone has to pay
Curse the ones that took you
Curse their evil ways
Curse the ones they love
Curse them all their days
If I find out how they are
I'm going to make it right
They're gonna give you back
Or there's gonna be a fight
All the selfish people in the world today
We'll be held responsible
We're gonna pay
You can't fall asleep

And then we'll take it all away",R&B
"I stood by while you flirted with my friends
I held my tongue while you kicked me on my shins
But this morning I found a strange necktie on the floor board of our car
Someday you'll push me a little bit too far
I'll forgive you this time but don't ever let it happen again
Some day you're gonna push me just a little bit too far ah of course you did not
Well you thought I'd be working all night long
You had the nerve to bring your boyfriend in our home
And now that I have found out what kind of wife you are
Some day you'll push me a little bit too far

Make up after what you've done to me
Well honey I'm just like putty in your hands
Okay come on let's broke the mountain yeah up the mountain

paso por mi mente.
Sentimientos que ya no van a volver...
Un lugar, una cancion, un sueno perdido
y la esperanza de seguir sin mirar atras.
Todo lo que alli deje, alli se quedara.
Es triste recordar.
Saber que lo que mas amas se e ira
o tu amor el que poco a poco morira..
Es tan dificil comprender
que todo tiene un final.
La vida me enseno a pensar
que todo tiene un final.
Que todo tiene su fin.
Se que no estaras ahi
por siempre a mi lado
y que algun dia perdere
tu amor, tu amistad.
Es un sueno imposible olvidarse de que
todo en la vida terminara.
Cuando ya nada me quede seguire,
hasta que llegue mi fin...que mas da.
Es tan dificil...
Saber que lo que mas amas...",Metal

I fell into your face before I ever knew your name
You're no stranger you know what I like

You got me in a cross fire, drivin' in my car
You come on like a daydream, you move just like a star

"I came from far
Beyond Your reality
The ocean of time
It's the odyssey of mine
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell You
Where I've been
And what I saw
And how it ends
Welcome to the wasteland
In a world which is turning faster
Where I'm alone for a while
It's turning faster
Away from light straight to the dark
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in an ancient dream so bright
And then the march of time begins
The man in black he waits
Behind this last task
It's full of pain
To sacrifice the only son
The legions of the lost
Wait in the old mine
They try to stop me
The battle it has begun
So I'm not afraid
To walk down to the wasteland
I'm so alone on my way
And I don't fear that dusty god forsaken path
Somewhere far beyond

Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time begins
Look at my soul
And behind
There are some things
I've to hide from You
I'm following the black man
I'm losing control
And I don't care
What's happening to the boy
Welcome to the new world
One more step to the dark tower
And my whole body's in flames
I'm looking for Those healing things to be prepared
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in a prisoner's dirty life
And then the march of time begins
The prisoner did bring the healing spell
The queen of shadows found herself in pain
And death brings answers to us all
What will I find
When the dark tower appears
Will it be the end
Or just a new quest after all
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell You
Where I'd been
And what I saw
And how it ends

Look around and see
The world is turning fast
Faster day by day
Somewhere far beyond
I'll try to change it
If I can - Somewhere far beyond
There's only one chance
And it lies - Somewhere far beyond
Somewhere far beyond

"Moonlight through branches of the trees
Cold but magnetic
Inviting and putting me only guard
The light of dreary solitude
But hardly everything is so faceless
The look of the moon like your reflection
The thoughts of the lonely heart
The grief and joy of your soul
The suffering of unrequited love
On your face the silent movement
Of the cold light
Coldness penetrating into flaming heart
Night embrace carrying you away
Following the moon so taciturn
Like you are in your solitude
All day long you have been waiting
For the moonlight approaching
To impart to it your story
To disclose your thoughts to it
To reveal your soul
To chill your heart
You are free in night time only
And concealed from alien sights
Confronting your reflection
Moon is the mirror of your consciousness
Into which you look any time
You want to understand yourself
You're grateful to dusk
You're hardly waiting for the dawn
Moonlight through your glance
Cold heart inviting
And putting you on your guard

"""Blacks are too fuckin broke to be republicans""
In this land I can't stand or sit
and not get shit thrown up in my face
A brotha never gets his props
I'm doin bellyflops at the department of waste
And everyday I pulls a front so nobody pulls my card
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin hard
I'm lookin behind me beside me ahead of me
There'll be no feet makin tracks here instead of me
But I can't disregard just what the news says to me
I'm twenty-one, so I've reached my life expectancy
At any minute I could be in some shit that kills my skinny ass
From motherfuckers doin the sellout strut or probably Oakland task
My relationship with OPD has been like one big diss
Long arm of the law, grips my dick so tight it's hard to even piss
So I forgot ain't even got a pot to do it in
Up at the church they're tellin me it's because I live in sin
So I grin, but nevertheless my mind won't dwell
I must be trippin cause I thought I was livin in hell
Capitalism is like a spider, the web is getting tighter
I'm struggling like a fighter, just to bust loose
It's like a noose asyphyxiation sets in
Just when I think I'm free it seems to me the spider steps in
This web is made of money made of greed made of me
Of what I have become in a parasite economy
In the winter there's a splinter with the smell of the rain
And the scent of the street, but all I smell is the pain
Of a brotha who's a hustler and he's stuck to the grind
Of a sista who's a hooker gotta sell her behind
Desperation makes her brotha get a little more bold
The circumstance gets deeper when it's damp and it's cold
So I spend my time thinking bout the ultimate gank
Can I get my Coup together pull a move on the bank?
I be the picture perfect hustler for the piece of the pie
But my daddy always taught me just to reach for the sky
Now my dream and aspirations go from single to hoe
As I realize there's a million motherfuckers in the cold
No need to be told, cause when you got a million po' people
Gettin ganked, by a few that are rich and evil
But it's illegal, to wonder how they livin fat
 everybody get a gat
Ahhhhhh yeah!
Niggaz, thugs, dope dealers and pimps
Basketball players, rap stars, and simps
That's what little black boys... are made of
Sluts, hoes, and press the naps around your beck
Broads pop that coochie, bitches stay in check
That's what little black girls... are made of
But if we're made of that who made us
and what can we do to change us
The oppressor tries to tame us
here's a FOOT for his anus!
Well since the days when I was shittin in diapers
It was evident the President didn't like us
Assassination attempts I'd root for the snipers
My teacher told me that I didn't know what right was
Well she was wrong cause I knew what a right was
And a left and an uppercut, too
I had a hunch a sucker punch is what my people got
That's why I was constantly red, black, and blue

una guitarra sin cuerdas
un collar falso de perlas
que nunca vieron el mar
Fuiste un jardn de malvones
un vinilo sin rayones
una dama de verdad
que duro 15 minutos
y ahora me dejas el luto
de no querer verte mas
Fuiste una lady Madonna
fuiste un gol de Maradona
fuiste la mano de dios
fuiste todo pero fuiste
yo no se si me entendiste
que te estoy diciendo adis
Fuiste un ""da que me quieras""
fuiste Gardel y Le Pera
y la Isla de Camarn
fuiste en Madrid, Hortaleza
y en Buenos Aires princesa
reina de mi corazn
Fuiste la luz de mi vida
y mi musa preferida
que ya no puedo expirar
ni un canto ni una ranchera
ni un solo verso siquiera
solo esta cancin de adis
Fuiste la luz de mi vida
y mi musa preferida
que ya no puedo expirar
ni un tango ni una ranchera
ni un solo verso siquiera
solo esta cancin de adis
Y este fue mi testamento
de un amor que de contento
no me dej ni el sudor
solo queda despedirme
con voz ronca pero firme
el mal trago ya paso
Medio vals mitad ranchera
le pongo el nombre que quieras
y lo pinto Rock and Roll
aqu adelante de todos
le estoy diciendo a mi modo
te estoy diciendo a mi modo
buena suerte, chau, adis..",Pop
"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby",Pop
"It's a strange day
The roses are in bloom
But in a strange way
I know somehow we're doomed
Look around through the town
Not a soul to be found
In silence, not a sound
There's no one around but you
In the back of the car
On the way from the bar
In silence, here we are
Reminding us of how we're doomed
Well, get set,
It's time, we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
And I won't stop,
Not 'til I get what I want
And all that I want is you
In a strange place
When the sun goes down, we move
Into a strange phase
Like we've got nothing left to lose
So we slip through the town
With our heads in the clouds
In silence, not a sound
For miles and miles around
Fall asleep in the park
Underneath all the stars
In silence, here we are
Reminded of how we're doomed
Get set,
It's time we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop,
Not 'til I get what I want
And all that I want is you
It's you
All that I want is you
Yeah, you
All that I want is you
So get set,
It's time we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop,
Not 'til I get what I want
And all that I want is you

And if we ever cry out in the night we won't call each other's name

I know I'll dream about you but if you'll call my name
We'll both hurt someone who shouldn't be
So I'll just call you darling...

There's a dear one who's weathered life's sorrow it's that silver haired daddy of mine

If I could erase those lines from your face and bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone to that silver haired daddy of mine

Valhalla, Honor to be forever free
Slain in the course of a conflict, will the courage displayed suffice
As he lay there motionless in wonder none to soon he will surely see
This time this place this one shall not go for his story shall end in vein
For this will be his last sunset and his dawn will end in only pain, Pain
Time after time I watch the fallen, All of them hope to hear me calling
Enrich their lives only after death calls, soaring into golden halls.
There is one now of noblest blood, prepare the journey to pass into heavens
of everything you could ever dream to,
come to me and I shall greet you

how could it be wrong?""

Explosions in my head that just won't quit
A train is crashing through the wall around my heart
And left it only dead, obliterated.

The silence ringing through my ears

Things colliding

Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify
I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes
Hope will never die
Burn!
Take away the pain of being me
Soothe my soul caress my heart
And end my fear of my bad memories
Eradicated

Like gunshots running against the silent night
My love was silent and these words
Were stronger than the rest, unstoppable

Down the street, down the street
Where I live
Sad things begin
I could feel from within
From the message, from the message

About a buddy of mine

Somebody past noon, shot across the room
And now the man no longer lives
Too bad about him
Too sad about him
Don't get me wrong, the man is gone
But it's a wonder, he lived this long
Up in the city they called him Boss Jack
But down home he was an alley cat
Ah, didn't care nothing about being black
Oh, Billy Jack
There can't be no fun, can't be no fun
To be shot, shot with a hand gun
Your body sprawled out, you without a doubt
Running people out, there on the floor
Sad bloody mess
Shot all up in his chest, shot in his chest

Get on the floor and work it out if you can
Here's my ulterior motive,I mean my game plan
It doesn't hurt to flirt,just go 'head and chase a skirt
You can't help it,it's your line of work

It's you they adore,you might as well
Give'em what they came here for

We're gonna cold take the party to another plateu
But in order for us to achieve a new height
We want to hear Flash cut the beat up,ain't that right

You gotta dance 'cause the beat is finger lickin' good
Throw your hands above your head and reach for a cloud
And if there's anything you want to say,say it loud
I know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim
And ya'll are letting me know we're cold blowin' the rim

Just show no shame,you know it's only night
And if there's anything you want to get off,get it off tonight

Flash whoopin' the mix while I'm kickin' the gift

When he cuts,give him room,or you might get sliced
He's too cold to hold,too hot to be stopped

Whether you like it or not,we rock
Yo' since the day we emerged,have you heard
That it was all about a party and yo this is word
This party's rated NS for no suckers allowed
That's the scoop
Hear me troop
So don't you come here actin' wild

You're tired but everyone's tired

Music of looms waving all our loves again

Hair will become interesting
Pain will become interesting
Second hand gloves
Will become lovely again

And the corn it ripens fastest when the frost is setting in
And when the young man tells me that my face he'll soon forget
Before we part I bet a crown, he'd be fain to follow it yet
And the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the swallow skims without a thought as long as it is spring
But when spring blows and winter goes my love then you'll be free
With all your pride and to follow me where it crossed the stormy sea
And the snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the bee that flew when summer shone in winter he won't sing
And all the flowers in all the land so brightly they may be.
And the snow it melts the soonest when my true love's for me.
So whoever says to me farewell here, no farewell I receive,
For you will leave me at your side, or you kiss and take your leave
And I'll wait here 'til the moorcock calls and the Martin takes his leave

On a voyage of discovery
On display, like a freak show
While these crazy people are watching me
While these crazy people are watching me
As a deeper state of coma
A prescription from an unknown hand
Drifting into the drug
Injected to secure my ideas
Injected to secure my memories
All these crazy images in my head
Bloodlines left behind
Bones buried, hidden by earth
Life takes mysterious ways
In a blink of an eye, all twisted around
Burn my skin, pull out my nails
It won't heal, invisible scars inside
Bad luck, get your act together
Leaving, destination unknown

It was kissing my eyelids and burning my face away
Dying felt so goddamn good today!

We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs


Eating dead flowers bleeding in a strange daze
I was cutting throats and eating tears
Smiling in a ruined age
Douse my love everything with gasoline
Grave flower blooms at your red light death scene
We dance the electric Pagan Love Song 
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs
Trippin' on real blood in strange sunshine

Sister I been trippin' in your sky
I woke up adrift in a Technicolor bliss

that if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs

Not moving much with
Not too much to say

No motor car no house no wife
It's cold, he thinks
As he washes up in the sink
While the spiders go bananas
He slips into his new pajamas
And waits to be king

Thinks of times when he was young
He could run so fast
He could win the prize

To dial correctly,

Blast pass, ya half ass, staff like casses clay
Pass the tray, pound gripped wit the satin
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Hung over from hennessy, wit a menace in tennessee
To creep like, burglars heraldin' all you suckas in the industry

I know the rules, you all tryin' to change'em
'cause, you a star, wit ya video models you be frontin'
At the bar, me and my thuggs in back, sippin yack
Relax, tat it down, jus dyin' to go out wit macks
I know the rules, you all tryin' to change'em

Relax, tat it down, jus dyin' to go out wit macks
Verse two
It get's hectic yall, switch the rules
Get cha tools, my motor for runnin' down 'cause
Ya bitch inproved, reelected as any, as respected
Outlaw glocks, got it locked, wit all these blocks connected
From the east to the west, back home wit tha vest
Seen it all and still ball, a dog you can't impress
Cores ya soul, wit this gold mic molest
When I blow'em ain't nothin' less, drinkin' in front of ?
Don't get prayed over and laid, picked from bein' pounded
Tha 41. wit the quick flip speed rounded, clothes you identify
Bitch made niggaz, I got a point
I'm out ta minimize, down goes ya squad and ya c.e.o, to
Step in the streets, steadily infectin' ya crew
He betta act, or get smacked, wit the ten mack two<echoes>
Chorus
Verse three
Secerts of war, we bust if we must plus
And handle business, when you jealous playas
Fuck wit us, turn the party out
Soon as they whip the lime beocardy out
It's all we out, been up all night, when the guards be out
Call me out, picture perfect life, when I live it
Run ya part of town like emmitt, only five minutes in it
Militant minded, combined wit a sentence
All you fake thug niggas, ya crimes ain't constant
Even po-nine, they give me mine from a distant
My chain dangle, hold the henny on a strange angle
Aim and bang you, who the fuck you tryin' run ya game to
It's crunch time, I'm servin'em when it's lunch time
Give me mines, stealin' ya hoe, and I'll throw just one rhyme
Yall niggas squealin', my thuggs is still dealin'
Got niggas hittin' the ceilin', on them fiffty story buildings
Clack back the strap, give me that wit the equipment
Chorus
To all my thuggs, all around the muthafuckin' county nation
World wide, keep on sittin' in the back, wit that yack
Keepin' it real, y'all know who it go dowwnnnnnnn

You're not everything you thought you were

It's not too late, not yet at least
You can always change for the better
I'm not saying it's easy, but neither is life
You've noticed your mistakes, it's time to make a change

Gone from the brickyard, gone from the mine

Nein, was the cold reply of Frau ecstasy
Sitting on a mossy stump, among all the bottles drunk
Breathe cold against the air

Soaked to the bone I'm all alone, poor me

Don't know where to go
Don't know if I know
What is good to be known
I wonder if madness
Is just a child
Of my urge to know
The more that I ask
The more I get down
A million times
My quest for life is pain
But still it has not made me going insane
And I long for more
For a trace of life
Tearing down all doors
For a trace of life
You tell me you wonder
If wondering is heaven or hell
You say that you've got the view
On the dark side of life
You can't see the shadows
The others can see
But you can see it's well:
The sun and the day
The light in the sky
A million times
Your quest for life has been pain
But still it is the key to make you sane",Metal
"Out where the children all get their own rooms
Where they stir coffee with old silver spoons in their mansions
There's a girl that the whole town can see doesn't fit in
But they all know that she understands them
And they want to know
Where the kid came from
She won't tell anyone
But they know she's a liar
That's what they know
She's a liar
That's what they know
You do what you have to do
Maybe you could be a liar too
There's a school where she goes every day
Everything that you could want if you pay you can find there
She came in with a dream and a plan
Learned how to use movie cameras and started to shine there
And they want to know
Where the kid came from
She won't tell anyone
But they know she's a liar
That's what they know
She's a liar
That's what they know
And if she had to
She could turn the camera right on you
As for the teachers they all knew her crime
When she was everyday always on time they saw through her
She took the train from the city at dawn
Broke through the woods and crept through the lawns to her future
So maybe they know
Where the kid came from
They won't tell anyone
And they know she's a liar
That's what they know
She's a liar
Just because
She reached higher
They are so proud of their liar
They are so proud
You do what you have to do
Maybe you could be a liar too",Indie
"Imaginations, conversations, tearing us apart
What ever happened to those friends we shared at the very start
Don't need them, just need you, the only thing that gets me through
Another time, another life, maybe next time I'll get it right
Always denying, constantly lying, they creep and they crawl
Making sure your miserable, making sure you fall
Don't need them, just need you, the only thing that gets me through
Another time, another life, maybe next time I'll get it right
Believe in me, I'll show you this is right,
by holding us in your mind and not losing sight
Don't need them, just need you, the only thing that gets me through
Another time, another life, maybe next time I'll get it right
Who needs enemies when you have friends like those
Whispering about nothing better left untold",Rock

Fears lie like gunfire in our eyes
Can't change the way we feel
It hurts us every time
Throwing hearts that will never heal

The words will never show
The you I've come to know
If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go
There's no one home but you
You're all that's led me to
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself for me

"A place afar in distant dreams
Mystic winds blow
Men mount birds of prey to war
And raid each others shore
Wizards and Warlocks battle by night
One survives by cunning and might
Take what you can by sword and Sabre
Just reward for perilous labor
Stands among them a natural King
A man of barbaric breed
In a blade of steel he lays his trust
Killing and taking his needs
Upon him the scars of battles gone by
From many who have gazed in his murderous eye
Astride his mount he cursed and then
Assembled his men in thousands and ten
Onward lads we'll kill them all
Victory is ours
We'll have their heads and female slaves
Soon to loot their towers
Riding hard they rushed the gates
And scaled the granite walls
Through boiling oil and falling stone
His men endured it all
In bloody streets the battle raged
Brave men died and women were caged
Amidst the hoard, a barbaric roar
He gut the guard and kicked down the door
Sword in one hand, torch in the other
Alert every step of the way
If legends be true this place is cursed
Demons stand guard night and day
Living hell cloaked in black
Three ungodly hosts
Upon the dais a ball of light
Which binds them to their post
Faster than a striking cobra
Hit the altar and knocked it over
Shattered in a silver shower
The priests of hell have lost their power",Metal

I gave you everything you were my reason to live
Everythings out of place
There's an empty space
In my heart
And I gave you everything
You took the best of me you took everything I had
You took so selfishly and gave nothing in return
I would have set you free if that's how it had to be
Why would you lie 
Why would you need to make me cry
Ooh, yeah, I cried myself to sleep that night

It wasn't right to close the door without so much as a goodbye
Could have blood from a stone
Why did you leave me alone?

Where do I begin?
Words fail, tears come

To take the thoughts I almost think
And carry them to God for me
Deep breath, exhale
Breathe in deeper still

Is there anyone
Who can find the things I'm barely feeling
And give them wings beyond my ceiling?
Right heart, wrong place
It's too far to outer space
Sorry, I forgot, You're right here

Women said they loved me my how they talked tellin` me lies
And fillin` my eyes with tears that I couldn't control

They were only tryin` to pull the wool over my eyes

I couldn't find love the blues were a habit

I can keep living off sympathy
I can tell all the people that all of the success
Is a direct reflection on me
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
What is important
What's really important

Will I ever know silence without mental violence

 Denn ein Wrack ist ein Ort, an dem ein Schatz schlummert.
Jetzt sind wir frei, chillen auf gigantischen Berggipfeln
Du musst dann sagen, keiner kann unsern Schmerz diggen
Wir sammeln erstmal frÃ¶hliche Kiff-Sonntage
FÃ¼r die hituntermalte Schnittmontage

I'll love you twice as strong
Til every seed of doubt is gone
There's no other woman near

"Save a little of your energy
Spend a little of your time with me
What is it that holds you here to me?
You must be moved by something that you see
Strains of magic in the moonlight hours
Render useless all your Earthly powers
Souvenirs of childhood haunt your face
It must be that they've fallen from your grace
And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes, sometimes
Subtleties betray you everywhere
That's a secret you forgot to share
Like how auburn still brings out your guilty streak
And seemingly it adds to your mystique
Moody silhouettes, you soon replace
With swarms of passersby that flood your space
Your superficial scars, you can conceal
There are others left with wounds that will not heal
And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes
Empty now, but once it held

I hear the clock a tickin'
See the sweat upon my brow
I know my destination
Nothing's gonna stop me now

Baby I've got nerves of steel
Coming down to the wire
Lord above me guide the wheel
Keep me in your prayers tonight
I'll be weary upon that road
I know the finish line's in sight

There's a junkyard dog a barkin'
In the valley down below
He's wanting me to stop and
Gather up a heavy load
Ain't gonna heed his call
Ain't givin' him the time of day
You mangy mutt once and for all
I said I threw that stuff away
I won't have a bit of trouble
Heading down the straight and true
I'll fly solo on the double
Into the yonder blue
I might need some intervention
Out upon the icy turn
In a foggy situation
Squealin' on a hairpin curve

Baby its the way that you hold my hand in the car, and the way that we lie in the sand.
Its not that hard to see, that a single say without you could make me go crazy.
It takes my breath away, gives me butterflies when you hold me, when you sleep.
When you hold me in your sleep.
I never want to leave.

asked her how she spent the summer
said i interned at some law firm, i got a little sunburned
i saw some raver kid get murdered
i met a guy, and this guy i met he got me high

but the x makes me feel sexy and the sex makes me feel empty
the alcohol destroys me
and i did it in a disco with some guy from san francisco
who looked a lot like roger daltry
and the night of all that bloodshed i was kissin' on some crackhead
who said he knew about a party, he keeps it in his mouth in those crazy chipmunk cheeks
i gave him fifty and he kissed me, spit a little treat between my teeth
i think we're starting to peak
woke up at some hedonistic rodeo
with cowboys kissing cowboys, trading magazines for videos

But as long as the grass will grow
In the cracks of the sidewalk
Next to the old lampposts
As long as the birds will fly
In the thick broken air against a highrise sky
Then the morning sun will shed it's light
On the city down below
Inside a cab, the driver yawns, he's worked an all night shift
He sets his meter one last time before he call it quits
The heartbeat of the homeless still echoes in the streets
They're all wrapped in coats and blankets don't have enough to eat",Folk

Maybe it's not that way
Maybe I love you more than you know
Maybe you'll know someday
Maybe you think it's easy for me
Easy to say goodbye
Maybe it hurts me more than you see
All I can do is cry
But love is not enough to make you mine
You need someone who's gonna be there all the time
Someone to treat you better
Someone to see you through
Someone who'd never say
Goodbye, I love you
Goodbye, I love you
Goodbye, I love you
Goodbye, I love you
You need a man who's always around
Whenever you feel alone
You need a man who won't let you down
You need your man at home
You need the time to let yourself live
You haven't lived enough
You need the one thing I cannot give
You need the time to love
But love is not enough to make you mine
You need someone who's gonna be there all the time
Someone to treat you better
Someone to see you through

"We came from an island
In the sand and the sun
Hidden away from the world
Is that home of fun
We surfed all day
And ate food all night
When there was no more food
Eating sand was alright
But then one dark day out of the sky
Space Monster ""M"" and friends
Invaded our world
And we had to escape
But we vowed to return again
First we'd take over the world
And then we'd return again
We floated across the ocean
In a hollowed out log
From the blue beaches
To the land of smog
We washed up on the beach
The Professor took us in
And that's when the experiments begin
He gave us super powers from chemicals
Then he gave us instruments
So we could rock and roll
Now we're here to fight
To make our foes and friends
To take your money and go home again",R&B

"Our history runs down our rivers
Down our rivers to the sea
Reminds us of the things that matter
Home and heart and history
And all our sins will be forgiven
Washed away to set us free
By the rivers that run through our homesteads
By myth and modal melody
I traced these rivers from the cities to the seas
To remind me of what I already know
I traced the shorelines through a thousand histories
To remind me an island is my home
An island is my home
I traveled far across this country
Northumberland to Southern Downs
I wandered up the rolling Humber
And down the Thames to London town
And countless lives were lived and lingered
In the cotswells and the fells
I left a tapestry called England
And life and those who lived it well
I traced these rivers from the cities to the seas
To remind me of what I already know
I traced the shorelines through a thousand histories
To remind me an island is my home
An island is my home
Round here the sky is a little closer
A little closer to the ground
It's hard for someone to get lost here
Harder still to get found
And though I've seen a thousand rivers
From the Mississippi to the Rhine
The only place that I'll lay my hat down
Is by an English riverside
I traced these rivers from the cities to the seas
To remind me of what I already know
I traced the shorelines through a thousand histories
To remind me an island is my home
An island is my home
So place your trust into the sea
It's kept us safe for centuries
It shaped our shores and steadily
Its care has brought us, come
And when I die, I hope to be buried out in English seas
So all that then remains of me
Will lap against these shores
Until England is no more",Indie

"First of all I make sure I've got the right ingredients
Before I heat up the pan
I take a little bit of bitterness to grease it up
And keep everything close at hand
Then I add a few ounces of fresh frustration and half a cup of attitude
A rush of adrenaline to spice things up
And then half a spoon of bad mood
One bottle of my sweat one bottle of tears,
A few drops of my own blood
It all blends together like a cat and dog
And the result is as clear as mud
I pick the worst situation out of the bunch
And throw it right into the mix
And last but not least I add a little bit of spit,
Just a few little nasty cliques
That's my recipe for hate
I turn up the heat to 400 degrees and go to work on the attitude
I shake it all up in a provocative way to make sure it comes out rude
Then I grind down the frustration hard so that all of the scents can blend
I pour the sweat on top and then the tears
To make sure that I don't make friends
When the mood is wrong, everything is right, I can add the adrenaline
But I've got to be careful with the dose I use,
The effect shouldn't wear to thin
The blood comes last 'cause' it always has a tendency to cool and coagulate
So I calculate and make no mistakes,
It's so fresh that it still pulsates

Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
If you fear heights when I'm high hell yeah I'll go low
It taste so sweet, that sticky cotton candy
If you get carried away
We'll be starting a family
This is a perfect time for a magic trick
Good humor is no fun without the magic stick

Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat

Have your luscious seductions considered or not
Throw a hoop around the bottle
I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank you for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak
But I'm being sincere
Your pass is valid all summer my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There're so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lolly pop
Forget that, grip that, ride it non stop

Your troubled heart emotions show me
That there's so much more to you
Lift your fallen smile, make you mine, that's what I'll do
It's all up to you, if this is what you choose
Everything is so locked up so that no one can get close to you
Spin my world for me, I'd revolve around you
That's cause you're alright, and everything is fine
No reason in those reasons that you found to cry
You're OK, never leave you alone this way and I
I'd sing a song to you, and it goes like
A sweet sweet lullaby
I stumbled through the motions
Finding oceans at the sight of you
We're miles apart and I feel right next to you
This foreign distance will make us more persistent they say
That's cause you're alright, and everything is fine
No reason in those reasons that you found to cry
You're OK, never leave you alone this way and I
I'd sing a song to you, and it goes like
A sweet sweet lullaby, A little song to make you mine
Come on baby don't be shy, you know i'll stay with you
Tonight let's go
You know i'd risk it all to see us fall
To let go of the ghost when conversation comes to call
The past has passed, here's my chance at last
It's cause this love for you is something true
Baby it'll never pass
That's cause you're alright, and everything is fine
No reason in those reasons that you found to cry
You're OK, never leave you alone this way and I
I'd sing a song to you, and it goes like
A sweet sweet lullaby, A little song to make you mine
Come on baby don't be shy, you know i'll stay with you

If you really want somethin' we can show up at your front door

Act hard but ya heart made a marshmallows, man
Talk tough 'til you get cuffed and start tellin' damn

You gotta come a little harder, nigga
You wear jerseys while mine a throwback and yours is a Starter
You still gotta beg a hoe
And you mad 'cause you blowin' on oregano
You niggaz'll never blow, anyone to step in my ring is brave
I don't know a thing about hair stylin' but I can make a finger weave
Short stay, leave her butt in the telly
Lace up the beef and broccolis, peanut butter and jelly
I'm about to get this deal shorty know
That's why she foamin' out the grill like a Alka-Seltzer pill
I ain't loud around a snitch
I don't crowd around a bitch
The jumpsuit match wit the Carolina kicks
I been sick since niggaz was on Harlod Miner dick
I could call up a chick and put a child around her lips
Niggaz can't stand the fact that I'm real
I kidnap the queen from the castle and put her back on the pill
Gimme Barbie at her best, Bacardi at the chest
I'm similar to the young Marcus Darvy at the desk
Useta have ta push up, now I hardly got to press
Got two gun, and both lead to cardiac arrest

We won't bow down to a word remembered as liberty
They are preaching on now their time is yet to come
How long before we can make them undone?
In the name of believing
In the name of us all
We sing to tell you the stories untold
Can you hear our mourning?
They've taken our rights
Don't let the truth out of your sight
Deceiving appearance, they're dressed up as gods
Fake that they care, their conscience is lost
Denial their craft, and riots our goal
They lead those who follow and break those who fall
A future blackened by a change of heart
They'll try to fool us that they will greet us with open arms
A promise as empty as when we were sent astray
Our blood on the pen they used to sign our lives away
In the name
Honesty replaced by greed, they gave us the reason to fight and bleed
They try to torch our faith and hope, spit at our presence and detest our goals
They are preaching on how their time is yet to come
How long before we make them undone?",Metal

Look back on history, nothing much has changed
Thousands of soldiers of all countries, all marching the same
Every nation's leader says that our side is right
Every nation's leader says the time has come to fight
But they use the common people to settle their scores
It's time that we refuse to fight in any of their wars

Refuse to pull the trigger of a gun for leaders 'round the world

Than buy into their nationalistic brainwashing
Killing mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers
Common human beings not savages but people, like you, like me

What was it that came down on me that night
A conjuring, I held on to that moment
And lie just to make it alive
I stood out there in the covering
In the baskings of a holy night
And I was lucid and conscious
And hovering like a firefly
My mind stretched out on the canopy
It put its arms out slow
And I heard the whispers of silence floating down from the radio
So come on, come on I'm ready now
I got the feeling honey like I'm ready to roll
You see I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in bed of my soul
I saw the light from a kettle gun
Sixteen days under a Southern Sun
And there were times when I thought that
I wouldn't mind it if I lost my mind out there
You wouldn't believe me if I told you so
The things I saw were enough to make the man in me
A man in me, make a man of me
So come on, come on I'm ready now
Go get your things out honey, let's get ready to roll
Oh I can feel the wave coming over me
I've been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go
As a child I was wonder-eyed at the thought that I might know
A life in the ecstasy of Rock'n Roll
O-oh-oh i'm not taking it slow
I'm an arrow in a bow
You think that I don't know, what it is that makes me glow

"As I walked out one morning fair,
I found myself drawn thoughtlessly
Back to the place we used to live,
And you still do, now without me.
Around the back, away from the road,
Behind the bins, beneath your window,
I found the hulk, the rusting bulk
Of a shattered old piano.
Someone had torn out some of the keys
With cruel care, not thoughtlessly,
In such a way that one could only play
Minor melodies.
So I sat down in my sadness, beneath your window,
And I played sad songs on the minor keys of a broken piano;
A sinner amongst saved men on the banks of the muddy Thames.
As I have wandered through this city,
Like a child lost in the London fog,
From Highgate Hill, down to the river,
Then washed downstream past the Isle of Dogs,
I've had time enough to think upon
The question of what kind of songs
That you would choose to listen to
Now that I am gone.
And as I drift beneath that bridge,
Just down the road from where you live,
I've often thought I might have caught
Your voice upon the wind.
But as I stroked those broken keys
You did not join in harmony.",Indie

And break down your resistance
Like the bite of a rattler
At close striking distance

And tear you apart

On nights when she's lonely
She'll just drop by
She won't come out and say it
But it's clear in her eye
Sometimes I hold her
And sometimes I don't
Whenever it goes

I might pull up on 'em in the Lexus
I'm all about them dollars like 
Jumping out the Audi, I might catch a body
Smoking on this Cali, watching

If he ain't getting money get the fuck from round me

The serpent's underneath your bed
You summon all your angels out
They tell you it's in your head
And this may hurt for just a while
But it always comes out right

Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight
When all the secret codes you know
Can't seem to unlock the door
And all the road that led you home
Don't arrive there anymore
Don't scare yourself by thinking that
You've lose your only light
Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight
Go easy, go easy on yourself tonight
When all the pretty temples you built
Make you want to tear them down
You're crying over milk you spilled
Long before it hit the ground
Pull your mad genie back inside

I know I must go and I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up where we all came from

Crack a Swisher, crack the fifther
Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Mom's working late night, to get a plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight
Wish I could go back to them days 'cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid 'N' Play type
But that didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me
Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's son, going around the hood for serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like, ""Here hug em ma, one last time""
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine

Put your block down, recognize a king 'cause it's my town
Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit 'cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back
Never, she carried me for nine months so she can have whatever
Clever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas, told me that I'd be a king
So R.I.P. to Coretta, if you don't understand that
Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like, ""How come?""
That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum
Either way, playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a sidekick?

Hey, feel better than X n' Blow
Get high from a line turn text to notes
See these niggas gased up like Texaco
Watch your bitch pulling Pepsi Co
Ever since it was a NBO
Had magic glow, young dynamo
Young fool, young killa' with the finer flow
Young rapping doe, never will, never half a ho
Give me celebrate and have a toast
Young sister pretends to though
If its okay-ay for you
And I wannna take you so close
Tryina say Im here for the fantasea
Trust me, your fantasea

Have a bitch bling twice like

Non believers on astronome
Burning people like Fahrenheit
Run the world like Satellite

Right Dj to the beat, H pass the light
Far from the passive type
I excite your life and ass it
Better than your average
That is captain of the ship baby just imagine
Everything you want, you can have it
Trip, trip, trip, you on a magic
Do you really, really want the Ask us?
Growing with the Phoenix from the ashes
Corn with the Cash n'
No Quarter, No Ration
Numbers on the masses, runners of the nashin'
Anything you want is established
Anything you want you can have it
If Its okay for you
Oh so close to the moon
Oh so close to the moon
And I wanna take you so close
Life is a series of choices
What you eat, how You Look
Whether you do drugs or not
See only you can decide because the only person responsible is you
And if you make the right choice, theres nothing you can't accomplish
If you make the wrong choice, all your decisions will be made for you

"When I was young those stories took me in
Of G.I.Joe the comic macho man
They mean murder they mean murder
Disguised as fairytales
The hero never fails
They mean murder they mean murder
They wave their flags
They play their anthems loud
Teach men to kill then teach them to be proud
They mean murder they mean murder
The ticker tape parade
Hides all the waste they made
They mean murder they mean murder
When governments find that they can't agree
They settle differences so easily
They mean murder they mean murder
Hysteria has spread
And it's you who ends up dead
They mean murder they mean murder
Turn men into machines
Disguise the truth with dreams
They mean murder they mean murder",Rock

And strangers rushing in the night
I'm lonesome for a time
When I had you and felt complete
And then you sailed away from me
Along with all my dreams
I can't go on, I can't go back
I find that I am lost again
Tired of starting all over again
Where are you darlin'?
Do you think of me?
Where are you darlin'?
I'll see you in my dreams
I don't know where to go from here
My heart was true to you, my dear
Even after all this time
I let you disappear from me
Like the sun behind the sea
Will we ever meet again?
Each day I wonder where you are
Somewhere underneath these stars
Somewhere in my broken heart

All the memories that she leaves they could be erased
But since she's been gone I sing a different song
For nothing is working out for me

Brings to my mind the happy times before goodbyes were said
She's on my mind each morning it just stays the long day through
And I miss her say I love you
In every room of this house she left her memory
In every dream that I dream she walks and talks with me

Oh how can I forget her and say that I don't care

To love without fear and learn without question
How could I regret the meant occasions

How could I

Drown me in truth's modest waters
Loosen your grip identity
Free me from an ego's falter
Love too often is only a dream
If I am harsh and unkind to myself
So I share these attitudes with you
Must I try? How could I?

And saw a reflection of a face
Didn't notice the girl that looked at me
She was beautiful like an angel
She told me I shouldn't look so sad
He's the best friend I could ever have
There I go imaginaing things my minds running far away from me
Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking
And my lips keep on moving but I'm not barely sayin nothing
Could it be could it be just me or is it appetite
Somebody catch me I'm falling there I go again there I go again
I met a man the other day said I remind him of his daughter
He just staired into my face and could I trade him in for water
He's thristy got a hundred miles to go there I go
Pretending to be somewhere that I've never been before
Pinch me I'm dreaming in my mind I'm speed walking

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song
You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life
Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows
I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life
No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel

My peace of mind after sunset's occurrence
Away I walk to ye doleful masquerade;
My ravening and my words becometh aghast
The sun rises high, my feelings they die
Daylight misery...

O, death, with thy ebony cloak sublime,
How abstract thy harvest rose doth fall
Consigned to the flames of woe in sweet modesty...
I renounce myself from the everdawn
No god is as cruel as god himself
It's time to show the true face
No life is as dead as life itself;
This earthly realm imprisons my soul
Innocence raped in the sunrise,
And I watch how the beauty dies

For darling a love like this to go so easily
Oh to think of the sadness
So many hearts all day are lost and torn apart
Baby that won't be you and me

Keep on giving up my love

Across the orgasmic veins of the city - circle of death

Nothingness - I am alone
The walls, the bricks, a girl, oh God !

But something keeps holding you back
Keep on acting like you don't care
But my heart remains intact
I'll keep waiting on this love affair
Until nothing can hold you back

Through spring summer fall and winter's change
This crazy crazy heart of mine will never be dismayed
Twisted fantasy?

Can we sail into a pool of trust
You and me in full bloom, I imagine us two
Growing fonder living stronger being true
I don't wanna be a fool in love
But my spirit is bond and I'm not giving up
10,000 days may break before the dawn
Until then, I'll be here, I'll be hanging on

Sometimes love can feel like
The closest thing to heaven
And sometimes love can feel like
You've been run over by a car
Yes it can
It's the strangest thing I know
Make you feel warm when you feel cold
And if you down on happiness
You better get used to the taste of sadness
'cause love can sure hurt sometimes
Love hurts and it don't
Love don't always work
Love ain't all it seems
It feels good but it stings
Love hurts and it don't
Some people will tell you
It's the best thing for the heart
Yes what they fail to tell ya
It can tear your life apart
But you know
It's as sweet as summer rain
But it can hit you like a train
Fill your heart with pain
Fill your heart with pain
Ooh everybody sing, everybody sing
Hook
When you know that you're alive
'cause you feel so much
When you feel you can't survive
But you make it anyway
When it feels too good to stop
But it hurts too much to stay
Then you know, yes you know
You gotta know love hurts
It hurts and it don't

To build up powers you can't fight
So kind and noble till I wake the animal

I hate to be your marionette
And I won't care if you'll be hanging
Shut... up - come in my bed
I'm a reckless animal
Spitting out a flood of lies
Till you know my perversity
Is to do it and do it and do it and die
Black suite and business,
Till I wake the animal

"I knew of two sisters whose name it was Christmas,
And one was named Dawn of course, the other one was named Eve.
I wonder if they grew up hating the season,
The good will that lasts til the Feast of St. Stephen
For that is the time to eat, drink, and be merry,
Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey has flowed.
And the whole family tree you neglected to bury,
Are feeding their faces until they explode.

There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias,
Mixed up with that drink made from girders.
Cause it's all we've got left as they draw their last breath,
Ah, it's nice for the kids, as you finally get rid of them,
In the St Stephen's Day Murders.
Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air,
While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair.
And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize,
The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize.
With his gin-flavored whiskers and kisses of sherry,
His best Chrimbo shirt slung out over the shop.
While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly,
His face closes in like an old cold pork chop.
And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast,
May still be found haunting the kitchen.
And there's life in it yet, we may live to regret,
When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'.

And knowin' I saw you I fell in love out of a clear blue sky

Dripping ruptures

Timelessness: unborn in timely shape
Balancing: between stone and sky
Promulgate: lamentations
Continually: she wails and she whines
Nonetheless: linking stone to sky
Leveling: the tarns to the tides
Circulate: limpid-forming tears

The cosmic light is fading, as the shadow's won.""

Say something
Don't sit there, say nothing

It's glory, Alleluia, this love is real
Won't you please clap your hands?
Please, say amen
'Cause love is so high, you can't get over
You're lucky to find a holy clover
Give it a try, you can't get 'round it
You'll reach the sky, you're only grounded
I will try to break it down, release it to be found

Won't you clap your hands?
Somebody say, amen
Hey, we can fill it up
And feel our love then come to us
Love is real, yeah, say it aloud
Sit down, say nothing
Trying to be real, not trying to fool ya
Don't know it all, just trying to school ya
This common love, you won't get by now
But this kind of love you'll find in the sky
We can feel it up
And feel our love encounters love is real

Don't sit down say nothing, no

One thing about it I never heard mama
Talk about going to Chicago too much
I might even go into New York city

And every afternoon I had a spot of tea
But it was lonely there by myself, I and me
Without love
So I went to Paris
The city of love, all by myself
Hopin' to find somebody else
But there's no love for me
I've been around the world
To find another girl
But there's no love
There's no life without you
I went to Alaska
But this time of year, it's too damn cold
It's not the kind of place you can go
Without love
So I went to Cairo
Athens and ended up in Rome
But then I realized I was too far from home
But there's no love for me
I've been around the world
To find another girl
But there's no love
There's no life without you
I check my message 
Hopin' you're missin' me today
And I didn't hear
And now I'm filled with misery and pain
So I went to Sydney
Down under is when 
Wastin' all the foolish time I spend
Without love
So I sent you flowers
Hopin' it was me you missed
I was thinkin' 'bout the first time we kissed
And if you still have love for me

"Hey yo man, remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! 
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card

Ate ice cream in a desert dream
And got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside
Too hot outside
Lazy days when I said let's go for a ride
We'd sail on Spirit Lake
Me, my pappy and his lemonade
Tim and Tina were my parents' names
They got engaged
They were inflamed
Seduced by the light of butterflies
How they shimmer, how they glimmer
Those butterflies
We seven kids
We almost died
Nearly put to death
By lightening strikes
Instead there was hot, pink
Flashes in the sky
We climbed the rocks, in snow and rain
In search of magic powers
To heal our mother's pain",Indie

Loves been so right
Loves been so nice
Loves been so right
I've been in love, many times before
But never has my love, ever been so sure
Girl I'm so glad, that you could care
So much for me
The girl is so bad, I can't believe
She belongs to me
Loves been so nice
Since you've been around
Loves been so right
I've been waiting for your love
But love has been over due
Well never did I dream girl
I'd find love so true

"Hey you,
Place called earth
Can I explain to you, who i am
I'm your worst nightmare
Worst nightmare - worst nightmare
I show no compassion - I've to run
Run to spread my horrible deeds
I posses no life - only one aim
Misery - scream for me - bleed for me
Misery - pain you feel pain is real
Pain is real - pain is real

"There was a time
When I would unravel
And drown in the snow
There was a time
When getting murdered
Would feel like a joke
But I'm Alive
Don't let me die
Now that I'm at the top of my game
There was a time
When I'd apologize
When I should have been saying 'Thank You'
Times when I'd be filled with shame
Over things that everybody goes through
But now I'm free
I like being me
Now that I'm at the top
Now that I'm at the top
Now that I'm at the top of my game
I get stronger
With every punch
And every kick
And every rock that hits my back
And every time that I get sick
Oh I get stronger too
There is still times when I feel sad as hell
And there are times I downright scare myself
Times when the rage inside me swells
Into a big black tidal wave
And I feel like an idiot
But I know I can deal with it

"Nobody is perfect but I'm pretty fucking close,
And I'm here to give you all a heavy heavenly dose.
I think you better listen 'cause I know who you are,
And I think that you should treat me like a superstar,
Because I'm more than just a human I'm the gift to all of you,
And I'm here to make sure that my message gets through.
I wonder if you're really all as dumb as you look,
Or are you smart enough to learn the rules in my book.
I hope you understand that the knowledge I bring,
Puts me in the position of a god or a king,
'Cause I'm blessed with the gift of the magic touch,
And I wouldn't say that I'm asking for too much.
All you have to do is get down on your knees and pray,
And I promise you the remedy is on its way,
But you can never be like me so don't waste your time,
Because I reign supreme and my position is divine.
What's wrong with being self-possessed?
Nobody satisfied with being second best.
I've got the gift and I know that I'm blessed,
And I've got to get it off my chest.
I'm the biggest,
The best,
Better than the rest,

I'm not afraid of competition cause I know that I'm best,
And you haven't got a chance to even pass my little test.
Even if you wanted to you couldn't pay the price.
There ain't no room for losers in my perfect paradise,
'Cause life is always based upon the weight of your success,
So I'll make sure that I get the most and nothing less,
If I love myself then everyone will love me too,
And there's nothing you can do for me that I can't do.

So welcome to my kingdom and enjoy your little stay,
Even if you can't afford it I'll still make you pay.
So you better come and get it and enjoy it while you can,
Don't tell me that you're dumb enough to think I give a damn.
I couldn't care less about what you achieve,
And there's only one thing that you have to believe:
The only thing important that you have to understand,
Is that no matter what you say it's still a god I really am.
I'm the biggest,

Runnin' from cops out on the block, the boy was hot and didn't give a fuck 
Runnin' up in the black mask, niggas if you got cash, drop it off in that bag and make craps fast
Destroyin' the system, make some money to survive the streets

And when he do it's always later, never came
He done broke that boys heart, man again, damn again
Don't wonder why it's like that in the ghetto
Grew up, outta luck
Don't give a fuck about life so we let 'em go

Caught glimpse of the moon
Romantic words by candlelight
They ended all too soon
All these roads that I've been down
And the faces that I've seen
I made my way from town to town
One step behind my dreams
And I've seen the way
Hearts can go astray
And the damage it can do
And my mind's made up
That no matter what
No one else will do
No one else but you
Sometimes fools will rush right in
And promises are made
But like whispers in the wind
Their words just fade away
And so on and on we go
Till someone comes along
Who can make this half seem whole
And make this heart beat strong

Hearts can go astray
And the damage they can do

To dry the tears away.

Dreaming dreams and holding tight;
Leaving all my sorrow far behind.

We can find a reason why and how we can fly.

Read the page of life!

And how to rise?
And if the stars would fall one day
I'd climb up to the sky
To put them back for you to save your smile.
Take a look into the book of fantasy and poetry and you will see:
What you can feel is everything you need to heal your crying mind,
The soul behind and everything that you may find inside your head...
A million years have passed away to make us head for the decay and to unlearn just
What we yearn for all day long: right to be strong and stick to our ideals,
Are they for real and do we just have lost the thread?

This was no surprise
Why you couldn't see, when I could so easily

You pushed me away and you know it
You should be ashamed and you show it now

All hating in my business
When I see you I'm a drop you
Get slugged and get drugged

Got you when I spot you I should pop you
Even the boss was telling me not to
But I won't stop until they get shot
When they get out the hospital
They gonna get shot, too
The fast one bringing that AK
Better walk, then we even
When I leave and flees to Cleveland
Now, murder 'em and rest in peace
So goodbye. We're shutting it down
And now we're prowling niggas from alleys
Cloning our sound, we found your town
Now is you ready for the war?
Cry loud and go
Many if all niggas 'll fall off in they sleep
And even oppose and order them hoes
Gonna flee with me?
Bitch, fuck with me then see that
My little aliens, yeah
We come to your city. Can they really
Put it on down with the pistol?
Can you feel me, feel me?

Scattered. Run for the border

Mo Thug Records taking over
I told ya. Soldier man your post
Better cover your coast and lock all entries

Instantly finna be World War 3
If you fucking with my family jewels. You fools!
You niggas break golden rules
Gotta walk the walk in your own shoes

I'm ready to ride. You ready to ride?
It's do or die. Then, nigga, I die
I jump in my Five Double-O
If you got it, better flaunt it

And cock the Glock; it'll make you want it
Come get it. And while you're rapping
On your song, just remember no pretenders

When I deal, hope I repented
'Cause if the world I resented
It just might catch me up in heaven
But I'm a work this earth til it hurts
Gotta done make the worse
All the way through trial
I'm back in the court for some dirt
Get 'em off soil. They wait for alarm
I curse that silly ass bitch said I stoled a purse
And at them bullshit awards. But they told me
I stole beneath of my shirt. And it makes me sick
Even Ripsta's sistas plus family understands
Fuck with it. Put it on your Grammy
Even my mammy's scared to tell. And
Deep in my mind, devil seeped in. Scary
Stay wary and carry on. Promise to burn me
Never bury and hurry if you ain't Bone

These niggas want to erase me
'Cause they can't face me

Ducking the cut, trying to look for safety
Make me reach for my pistol and pop it

Toss him in the trunk of the Caddy
On the way to the rodeo, killing all carbon copies
I'll be damned if I let a nigga breathe. Indeed
I grieve for the war. What's next?

As I look at my shit make history
No mystery. Mistook and, nigga

Make nigga want to sound like Bone for a record deal
Should'a kept it real and quit fronting. Nigga

"If you're like me you make believe
That everything that could possibly
Go wrong is gonna happen here tonight
And if you're like me you're on the brink
Of telling everybody what you think
As if what I had to say was important anyway
The first mistake that you and I could make
Is trying way too hard to compensate
'Cause I don't have to feel ok to be ok
I wasn't created just to live my life this way
I don't have to feel ok to be ok
And I refuse to live my life this way
If you're like me you lie awake
Scared to death of your mistakes
Somehow coming back to claim your soul
And if you're like me you're wondering
When everybody else is gonna see
All the stupid things you do
To keep the past away from you
The first result of everything we've done
Is living life but never having one
My first impression is I don't think that depression is
The tyrant that we make it out to be
Your life is yours to live for something way more positive
Than what you woke up feeling like today",Rock

You only been gone about an hour or so

Better tell the boss I can't come in
At least not until you love me again
Mommy's gonna get a little bit tired

Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back

Waiting on the blues to go away

What's up for today, I'm tryin' to kick it, know the homie wit it
Soup up my dog, we hittin' corners, gettin' seven digits
'cause they come out when the sun out, it's on again
I make 'em grin when they see the chrome rim spin
Twenty inch, don't know I'm stingy like the Grinch
I penny-pinch, let them play once and sit the bench
It's a cinch, to pull 'em out of the season
If she choose me, don't let that broad be the reason
Smash off and leave a cloud, music bump loud
Ride through the park and let them fifteens move the crowd
Pop out and bail through somebody barbeque
Make a play, drink a brew, see what I can run through
And half naked in the summer, I'm collecting numbers
I tell 'em keep it on the under, waiting for the sun up
Go down so I can clown, late-night creeping
That's how we kick it, every day is tha weekend
 
We came to smoke 
Light one bitch or foe 
Sippin' on some Henn 
'cause it's on again 
We came to choke 
Light one bitch or foe 
Sippin' on some Gin
'cause every day is tha weekend

Slide by the store, pull out them big faces
We livin' today, we gettin' drank by the case
Leavin' traces of burnt rubber on the floor
Everywhere we go, we light it up like the side show
I'm sittin' on the door hangin' out the vehicle
It's Breezy in the store, yellin' ""Celly, where you feel to go?""
Straight-lacin', pervin' until I'm on my face and
No destination, follow me, I got the population
To get yo' go, it's on when we hit the scene
I know you feign for them sticky, mean collard greens
Blowin' zips, chasin' chips, watchin' money flip
Trade more stories, reminiscin' wit' my click
Takin' flicks, never know when the party over
Every summer, it seem like I lose another soldier
Even ones havin' fun gotta watch yo' back
They still creepin, every day is tha weekend
 
We came to smoke 
Light one bitch or foe 
Sippin' on some Henn 
'cause it's on again 
We came to choke

We sittin' on chrome, gold thangs and hubs
We get the party started when we step in the clubs
You can mug, but don't underestimate these thugs
You can holla at a playa, I got nuttin' but love
""There they go."" That's what they say when we hit the floor
Get our groove on fo' sho', you know, that's how it go
Got tennis shoes on and I'm still gettin' in
See me at the bar, reelin' 'em in, I'm tryin' to win
Seen this notch with this tight dress on filin'
She kept smilin', sippin' on Long Islands
They was zealous, I love it when a woman choose
And when she hear this conversation, I can't lose
It don't stop, late night, still on the town
Slide by the after hours spot and put it down
That's how we do it, got the bomb and the fluid
The homies bringin' the freaks and every day is tha weekend

I've had the pieces stripped
By long hands feeding small minds

From the corner of the ring we gave up
The optimist had died, leaving the black side to tow the line
Who is the sin from the man, who is the sin?

And here am I born of a lost cause
The underdog, an alien in drag, dying

being alone when the dogs are outside
In packs of ten, their muzzles removed, biting
I tried to save my inner sanctum
While all around were still playing with fire

I took adeath row sticker then slapped it on the chrome

I used to spray it on a locker, a nigga run up
I yell, ""death row"" and sock him and I kept a gun tucked

For all the world to see
You can bind my blood
But the spirit will remain
For all the world to see
No matter what you claim
The spirit will remain
They wanna see me down
On my wounded knees
Wanna see me cry
But my eyes
Have run out of tears
When there's nothing left to pay
Just a little light of day
I got something
You can't take away
Fly away
Far away
Deep inside
Shetter for my spirit and my pride
For all the world to see
You can bind my blood
But the spirit will be free
Forevermore...",Metal
"A glass ravine / The low clouds which wink
The boughs burnt diesel and burning pig
Wide rutted streets
""666 Park Avenue"", yells a big red sign
'Cause it's an Anglo-Saxon in love with his doom
Who left such a cheeky shrine
Then all at once the daylight came / The river lay ahead
In it stood a wooden horse so tall the water reached but half its leg
A sign nearby read ""Damn You Law--this horse's hollow core
Contains the means for your destruction!""
This all passersby ignored
""Save us, save us...""
When the great explorers, fortune hunters / Slave men, conmen set their sails
They dreamed of monsters without brains
Great hulks to block their treasure trail
Well, they got by with homicide but here's the end to the magic spell:
Now the monsters lie in mouths, in veins, in genitals, in empty bellies
Baby, baby, won't you treat me kind?
I'm only a white man who longs to die
To end I need the power that you must give me
Send the children outside! Don't resist! Don't cry!""
The ray of hope as hoe of rape
Reflecting light from tractor headlamps into the victim's face
We bleat about our pain and how we lost and feel defiled
And we cry all night for Santa Claus to make our blizzard mild
The poor kind European white man never hurt a fly
We were friends to all the races, every woman, every child
""Save us, save us...""
So back in the dirty hotel I lay in my clothes and I slept
I dreamed that I was face-to-face with an amorous dragon
Who wanted to kill me and beckoned
I approached, unsheathed, and said, ""Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!""
Let me be at one with my destruction
Won't you please acquaint me with your beautiful loss?
Let's go!",Rock

Never trust a bitch if she got the hood tattered on her

Two baby daddies, one from the 60s and one from the Jumpers
Make it even worse, her whole family's full of killers
After the funeral she right back to the followers and filters
She got a Range and a Benz
Doin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends
Bitch just stole a TV from Target
Yellin' at her kids while Joseline and Stevie be arguin'
She blocked from Drizzy's page now she all on my dick

So many different faces as the city passes by.
I watch their tired eyes; journeys never made.
Broken dreams of leaving fill the streets with dust.
This is our final journey; it's the end of the line.
Constantly in transit, we just want to go home.
The rain that falls for weeks, painting pictures on the streets,
Twisted stars beneath my feet, I cruise the crowd.
I could be one of them, going back and forth,
Between familiar places, as my blood turns cold.
I watch with gypsy eyes: secrets never told.
Stolen years of yearning turn their tears to dust.

A complete jealousy of the recently dead
The deepest of all admirations, so foul

Do you possess the gall to pain all those in life you've touched?

My conscience has begged me to end this horrendousness
Wrap rope so tightly 'round my neck and twist

The only thing I will get right in this life
My appeal shall not be denied
My place - now secured
My home - the other side
I never belonged here
I never did ask if I could join this world collapsed
A hell hath awakened and now I choose sleep
So let this razor get the better of me
Suicide be my light
The only wrong I stand to right in this life
To the ear of the Reaper confide
His blade offers mercy
May it tear me wide

I never did ask if I could join this world collapsed
My hell hath awakened and now I choose sleep
So let this gesture do the talking for me

No where to run no where to hide
So now I have to defend myself
With a special guarantee
My future is expecting
I have to end it all right now

Though all these lost years
There's nothing but
silence-confussion
some pictures-illusions
How can I wait for hope?

to my neck, to my being
Nothing but shapless thoughts
Too much heat inside
Blinded moves, fear of wrath

So here I stand
Lika a ghost sculped in time
who can be my guide?

He knows about my silent destiny
I feel anguish
I'm riding the tomb of the gods

When the night fall
His shining eyes reinforce
The lip's warm smile
It was an image of that
Secure, peaceful and quitness
Like a beauty extension
The silence, the call have some gloom
Everything is so peacefull
That I feel buried in a sea of stone
The atmosphere is shrinking
But the sun falls
And the moon grows
It's getting cold

All I can hear are dark symphonies
All I can see is some white light
At the moment I hear a dirge for me
I'm Walking my last steps alive
It's seems I'm sick
Of a pain with no cure
Beyond the fear
Trough loneliness I walk
Holding the stone
With my shrapened teeth

Searching and waiting....

That's death
Finally I've reached
The land of death surrounds me
By trying
Not Dying
Just about the time I leave
And after all I've said
There's nothing more I care about
but my last will
But at least I have
the strenght to face it
I give a hand to death

Stop, everybody, what's that sound?
AK-47, so get the fuck down!

Well it's the #1 Assassin
Provin' a point to many people
Some claim to be assassins
But to Bone there is no equal
And Bone will stand alone
And buck down any other sucka
Me quick to pull me gun
And straight up kill that muthafucka
You never can know when Bone'll ?
Commit the one eighty-seven
'Cause all I can see is cockin'

You're dead on the dot, so fuck a blood clot
You know I'm expectin' to win this
So give 'em up, chump. I beatin' you down
To survive, survival of the fittest
No one can last. I'm beatin' your ass
I'm quicker to blast. I'm keepin'
The cash including the stash
So I will be killing you quick in a flash, come down
And it's a shame how I will kill without hesitation
Me load me clip, me fingers slip
Now that's the assassination
So pick up the body and tie it to bricks
Go dump it in the river

Squeezin' the trigger, then me break

So please don't test me fate
Layzie Bone will pull me gun, don't consider it strange
That reggae man who's on the scene
With the mind that's deranged, uh
The shit that me be doin' is like far beyond the usual
Rockin the mic or takin' a life

It came to me in dream
And I don't usually set too much store by the things that these things might mean
It was spoken with seriousness
More of a whisper than a scream
Now, I'm waiting on this Josephine
To show herself to me

I imagined, I could be
I just needed somebody
To show me how to be
I could have been Napoleon
Could have been Beethoven
Could have been anyone, but uncomfortable me
So come on now Josephine, show yourself to me
So come on now Josephine give me what I need
I don't like to be needy but sometimes needs
Must, I can't stand being the person that I've been

I'm a defeated commander
I'm a tone-deaf composer

You come as a car crash
And I'll go as James Dean

And you're a hundred days in 1815
I wrote all of these letters to my immortal beloved
You're the only one who's ever gonna know what they mean

Could have been runaway
Could have been what you need

Everything's under control
The speaker said with a serious smile
Behind his mask
He knew the truth
I'll bring a new age of better ways
The TV preacher said
Just pay today
Pay today
World's dressed in black
On earth's judgement day
And I?
I know it can't go on
Forbidden signs increase
I'm sitting still at home
And watching
Born in a mourning hall
Pale clouds feared the unborn child
Then it grew up with growing plans
Of suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear inside
That Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
It's frightening
Exciting to sit at home
And watch the burning fields
Get
Hypnotized by the TV snake
Obey and work hard
And feel no anger
Just sympathy for the higher class
There's no chance in changing things
'Cause I am
Born in a mourning hall
Silent cries ran out
When the cradle breaks
Broken dreams were unheared on
The other side
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear
In the new born child
That Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
And I'm a part of the machine
A puppet on the strings
A rebel, once
Now I'm an old man
Oh, I know this can't go on
But the ghost called fear inside
Lames my tongue, my nerves, my mind
Eternal fall down
Someone cut the strings off
I can't move
To get back courage
I've to face the truth
But not today
Goodbye
Born in a mourning hall
Caught inside a web called life
The only way to get out soon
Is suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Pale souls built a frozen world
Infected brains
Will never reach the other side
The other side",Metal

Somebody told me I should kill the beat: check
Let me know what's next
Somebody told me mama knows what's best
I been a spitter since, way back in the day I guess
And it's been a minute since I felt upset

But I'm gaining some respect, I guess
A champ with no rings
Hand that don't bling
But step up in a verbal ring
And I guarantee the punches will sting
Float like a butterfly
Consuming turpentine

I spit it so divine
Lyrics destroy the mind
I'm keeping the world alive
People would hate for no reason
Ain't the season for that
And that's the reason why I season my raps
Cause most rappers ain't leaving the trap

So wait for it
Waving a lightsaber
Claiming that I'm a wizard
Muggles are so confused
Cause I melt snow during a blizzard
Every step makes a fissure

I'm insanely debated

I don't roll with a traitor

Tryna find where the truth is
And after hearing these statements
I don't know where the proof is




I'm making a movement
It's foolish I'm super fluent
Try to catch what I'm doing
I attack with a brutal punch
And I'm currently coolin'
Making waves in the day
I'm in love with the trueness
Ain't no rules to the game
Hear my voice you say who this

I feel you
Plans to be the city's hero
Got my state's back like Paul N. Shapera
Hit box game zero
Feeling like marlinpie

I'm just gettin' started
I'm not gonna lie

No surprise I'll give you the business
Let's get it
Instrumental killer with no limits
The realest
Of emcees, I be the age 17
It's two ways to get paid I turned it to 23

I take off the sinful earth and fly
I'm carried by the wind so soft and clear
And by the bright blue sky
My flight is safe and fast, I have no fear

Of freedom and of passion
Is soaring in the space
It cavers me with warmth
And draws right to the edge
The edge engulfing me
With all its beauty
But only there I am tranquill -
And feel my lightness
My breath is deep

Of standing tall, the proudest we could be
I cannot fall, for I recall
We were born in majesty
And when the long fight, has been fought and won
We'll stand in the sun

And we will raise out hands
And we will touch the sky
Together we will dance in robes of gold
And we will leave the world remembering
When we were kings, when we were kings
Now is the time, here is the mountain top
When one man climbs, the rest are lifted up
With every step we're closer yet
To a higher destiny
And when we reach out to claim the thrown
Every man will know

I picked the books I thought I should and closed the door behind

And by the way what would I be without my past
Only find the right number when I doubt my math
Avoid blunders only after I recount my last
Setbacks that don't kill me just amount to laughs

Would I change the events or change my mind
Wouldn't recognize myself without my doubts and fears

I hope they're wrong when they're talking about me

All I need is a reason to keep on and stay strong
Gotta couple old ghosts that won't leave me alone
Even after moving three thousand miles from home
Thought I shook 'em when I hit Brooklyn wasn't even looking
But they're putting their mark on everything I do
Find a few quieted moments and they creep back through
Infiltrated my dreams and held my sleep back too
I don't know where I could go without them following me

"Farewell to the groves of shillelagh and the shamrock
Farewell to the girls of old Ireland all 'round
And may their hearts be as merry as ever they could wish for
As far away o'er the ocean I'm bound
My father is old and my mother's right feeble
To leave their own country, it would grieve their heart sore
Oh, the tears down their cheeks, in great floods they are rolling
To think that I must die upon some far and foreign shore
But what matter to me, where my bones they may lie buried
If in peace and contentment I can spend my life
The green fields of Amerikay, they daily are calling
It's there I'll find an end to my misery and strife
So pack up your sea stores now, consider it no longer
Ten dollars a week isn't very bad pay
With no taxes or tithe there to devour up your wages
Across on the green fields of Amerikay
The lint dams are gone and the looms are lying idle
Gone are the winders of baskets and creels
And away o'er the ocean, go journeyman cowboys
And fiddlers who play out the old mountain reels
Ah, but I mind the time when old Ireland was flourishing
And most of her tradesmen did work for good pay
Ah, but since our manufacturers have crossed the Atlantic
Well, it's now that I must follow onto Amerikay
And now to conclude and to finish my ditty
If e'er a friendless Irishman should happen my way
With the best in the house, I will greet him and welcome him
At home on the green fields of Amerikay
So pack up your sea stores now, consider it no longer
Ten dollars a week isn't very bad pay
With no taxes or tithe there to devour up your wages

"Just let me be the judge of what you've done and if I find
You guilty I'd erase you from my heart and from my mind
Talk is goin' over town that you my love had let me down
I don't believe what people say I still love you
I don't believe that you're to blame I don't believe you've brought me shame
I just can't believe that you have been untrue
They say I should go on alone that you've done something very wrong
That you're not worthy of the love I have for you
But I won't believe a thing they say until you say it's true
Just let me be the judge...

You tell me that the things they say are true that I should go my way
You ask me to forgive you for the wrong you've done
You say although you've been untrue I still mean everything to you
That you only meant to dance with him and have some fun
Then the jukebox played our favorite song you knew that you were doing wrong
You closed your eyes and made believe that I was there
And now you think it's better that we'll end our love affair
Just let me be the judge...",Rock

First thing monday morning
I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm lookin' for me a better day
You see the thing 'bout love
Is that it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pain
There comes a time when we could all make a change
Just let go
And let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right, you know
Let go, and let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go
Don't nobody want no broke heart
And don't nobody want no two time losers
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way
You see the thing of it
Is we deserve respect
But we can't demand respect without change
There comes a time when we must go our own way

When I'm feeling shitty, I mean really feeling down

'Cause it feels so damn good

Sooner or later you will put me down

And I keep on looking eventhough it burns

She goes off like a revolver
She got me wrapped around her trigger finger
Shot to the heart and it's her to blame
Those shots at the bar, you forget the name
If you get in the fire, you get the flames

You want the house on the hills
You ain't got time for the bills
You got the girl of your dreams
You think she's finer then real, so no
She's too hot, could you see her in youe future?
She's got a man and you're a damn common future
Your dumb mind ain't see it like you used to
Life is what you choose, but I guess it's what you're used to

Say she da best, I say prove it

Thinking I should call, but I never do bother

Heard that I'm doing better now the trick wanna holla

But damn, I got other things on my mind
You wanna slow down the time
Now you wanna tell me slow it down

Wanna kill it but you can't stop

Could slow it down, slow it down

Already on that 80 proof
Hop off in my coupe

Now that's drop top
Burn the bread, call it pop tart
When I'm in the mall, the nigga shop a cart
Got a U haul in the parking lot
Now you wanna tell me slow it down
When I tell you bring them hoes around
Wanna kill it but you can't stop 
Only call you after 1 o' clock

We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
For I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone

When I go out walking there's lots of loose talking
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it with all of my heart
We may have to leave here...

But you tell me they say the same about me

"I always thought if you want to change the world
Then you have to start with yourself
So if George Bush wants to end terrorism
He should go ahead and kill himself
I will not sign my blind faith away
To an unjust leader 
Corporate masters live in their lavish pool
Of extreme wealth and excess
Whoa, whoa
The phrase world leaders
Does not describe the heads of state
Those few in power
Work only for the corporate sake
No action, no interest, no humanity at all
As the corporate towers rise up
They watch the people fall
A government untouchable by the people
Run by the corporations of the world
Enslaving mothers, fathers, sons and daughters
Profits put before people
Equal force, equal reaction
Equal suppression, equal rebellion
Will not sign my blind faith away
To an unjust leader 
Corporate masters live in their 'cess pools
Of extreme wealth and excess
Whoa, whoa
The phrase world leaders
Does not describe the heads of state
Those few in power
Work only for the corporate sake
No action, no interest, no humanity at all
Corporate towers rise up
We've got to make a change
No religions, sexual preference
And regardless of your race
We've got to make a change
No war, corporate run
Governments, no police state
We've got to make a change
For the good of the human race
We've got to make a change
For the good of the human

Don't go crazy right now
The fist of fury that is pathetic
You will have to deal with

No flags, no patriots

"Take a breath, say you love me
We both know that everything changes
Keep in mind that none of this is fiction
This is just a glimpse into the head of a menace
We were two different children
But we born of the same moon
Blowing entire opposite
We were brought up the same too
I used to hate you because they celebrate you
And you made them notice every single thing I can't do
But really I honestly wanted to be you
And I just hope my desire to wasn't that see through
I never took into account the things that you were hiding
I even understood your rage when I see you get violent
I guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded
Until you sat me down and told me how crazy your life is
You said to run and never look back
And if I did, to never lose track of all the hurdles I was jumping
That lead me to my current goal
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Took a chance, said you'd love me
We both know that everything changes
You found me when I was dying and unappreciated
You broke me down into a science that I completely hated
You told impeccable talent didn't make me less average
But how I use it to my advantage determined my passion
It took some time to understand and manage
But then I learned this passion was the method to my madness
And I never got to thank you, at least not in the way I planned
But I had to learn before I did that, I hope you understand
It takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated
All the ashes burned to ashes
And I'm dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you
And even though you ain't my fan, you did the shit they ain't do
So disregard my temper and the times I fucking hate you
Because despite all my ignorance I'm really fucking grateful
Never forget the importance of the sparks you hold
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Took a glance, towards the mirror
Now I know that everything changes
I used to hate me, I swore my life was too painful
Let my demons overtake me before I fight with my angels
There was constantly a struggle to see my life at an angle
That provided understanding of how much drama could change you
I used to cut myself open just to feel like I was living
But when living is just dying then there's no longer a difference
There's no longer existence, and there's no longer persistence
And there's no longer a drive there existing on only division
And I thought, if nobody ever loved me
This vacancy inside me must be really called a bloodstream
Then I looked into the world and saw a million people like me
Probably never know your stories, but you're the reason I'm fighting
You're the reason I'm writing; music
Could be so reviving
And if ever you tend to forget, I'm right here to remind you:
Don't ever give into the hurt you hold
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold
Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold",Hip-Hop
"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I don't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
And I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeers click
And I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
Everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
And I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you
You baby

All I want for Christmas is you",Pop
"Theyre just words, they aint worth nothing
Cloud your head and push your buttons
And watch how they just disappear
When were far away from here
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Star-crossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of time
Oh who put all those cares inside your head
You cant live your life on your deathbed
And its been such a lovely day
Lets not let it end this way
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Star-crossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of time
Like sisters and brothers we lean on each other
Like sweethearts carved on a headstone
Oh why even bother, itll be here tomorrow
Its not worth it sleeping alone
And look at you and me still here together
There is no one knows you better
And weve come such a long long way
Lets put it off for one more day
And everybody knows where this is heading
Forgive me for forgetting
Our hearts irrevocably combined
Star-crossed souls slow dancing
Retreating and advancing
Across the sky until the end of time",R&B
"Went to the river and I turned around
Because I didn't want to drown, drown, drown
Wow, no no
But the water was cold and it didn't satisfy my soul
Well I went to the river once before
But no no no, I won't do that no more
Wow, no no
Yet the water was cold and it didn't satisfy my soul
You can tell my mama and my wife
I changed my mind, I'm not gonna change my life
Wow, no no
Yet the water was cold and it didn't satisfy my soul

Yes I went to the river and I turned around
Because I didn't want to drown, drown, drown

With lots of pretty women Lord it's fish after me
And I'd move then I'd move then I'd move to Kansas City

Now they call me pretty papa the smallest guy in town
The women are crazy bout me but my good gal turned me down
She done move she done move she done move to Kansas City
Honey baby where they don't want you

Now I walk upon the broadway looking down the peel
Looking for the gal that they call Lucille
She done move she done move she done move to Kansas City

Looking for the blond that made a champ out of me

"Am I bein untrue
when i blame it on you
afterall I'm the one who let you go in

that I gave you away

I should of stopped you
instead of turning away
losing your love

if I loved you at all
I could find words to say
but I didn't
so now it's too late
I should have said
don't go into the woods
don't let go of my hand

afterall I'm the one who let you go in, it's all my fault now
that I gave you away
to somebody else, I fear I'll never see you again, because of my own sin
is it because
you finished it second place?
but that's not true baby
don't you know that you won that race?
I guess I should've informed you
'cause I miss your sweet face
and now your gone
and now your gone without a trace
I should have said
don't go in to unknow places
young girls vanish without traces
I could not let that happen to you
woah
but if you leave me, oh just maybe
strangers in the dark are waiting
when you're gone there's nothing I can do
there's animals in that woods
and there's shadows in that woods
oh baby, there's manaics in that woods
but you're taking your chances
ain't no second glances

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

But nevertheless why stir up memories?
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?

"She was standing in the crowd
All alone and lookin' pretty
Listening to the music that we played
She walked up and whispered
I leaned down and listened
To the request that she made
""Do you know, 'You Are My Sunshine'""?
She asked so sweet and tenderly
""Do you know, 'You Are My Sunshine'
And would you do it one more time for me"".
Border to border
And ocean to ocean
I still look for her everplace
Chasing the sunshine
Each and every night I'm
Searching every crowd for her face
She was gone just as quick
As the song that she asked for
Taking my sunshine away
But someday when I finally
Look down and see her
I know just what I'm going to say",R&B

Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere and I ain't talkin' 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converse dog
Get it crackin' like we out in the yard and the warden's watchin'
Only difference is the whores is watchin'
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
I'm a gangsta bay-bee, from the C.P.T.
Run with the pound like I'm from D.P.G.
If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't no limit

Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my beam'

Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy
It's the kid from the far west I, oh, shit
He know how to do more than flip pies
Get money like them stick up guys
Them ""Ocean 11"" licks got the young kid rich for life
And I talkin' 'bout a movie or George Clooney
I'm talkin' 'bout, runnin' in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi
Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives

The trey with the Broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
A.D. jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels
In my neighborhood, I'm young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin' my name, 'cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home
In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin' through the spacious skies
Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up

In the middle of the night
You're asleep and yet you say
In your own sweet silent way
That everything's alright
And your hair is lying
'Cross the pillow by my head
You're unconscious to the night
You can't talk but that's alright
Let your breathing speak instead
I hear you breathing in
You breathe out on my skin

To know you're near me
I don't turn on the light
I don't need to use my eyes
The heartbeat by my side
Tells me you're here with me
My senses can deceive me
When I'm sleepy and confused
from my heavy eyes I see
Only darkness around me
My dreams long since excused
Then my thoughts go racing
Through the cloisters of my brain
In those midnight hours I find
That you hypnotise my mind
With your soothing pulse again
I hear you breathing in
You breathe out on my skin
That's when I begin
To know you're near me

I don't need to use my eyes

"I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody else
You expect me to be true and keep on loving you
Though I am feeling blue you think I can't forget you
Until someday you'll want me to want you
When I am strong for somebody new
And though you don't want me now I'll get along somehow
And then I won't no I won't want you

"Back in the day when I was younger.
I fell in love about every summer.
And I would be calling up the radio.
To dedicate my favorite song to her.
And I sung along with everything.
The words in the song, they spoke to me.
Now I need to know, where did the music go.
Cause my heart is crying out.
I need a love song about now.
Don't need no ring tone songs now.
Please tell the DJ, slow it down.
I wanna think about my baby now.
I want a old school type of slow jam.
You know the kinda where they used to romance.
When Luther used to sing like 'baby'
And Michael made the world go crazy.
I need a 12-play, two step, kelly kinda record 
I need a love song right now.

Back in the day when I got older.
The music in me had taken over.
So I wrote the songs that made the lovers dance.
Like ""I'll Make Love"" and ""Breathe Again""
Now I want to know, where love has been.
Its just not the same, as it was back then.
And the world needs to fall in love again.
Cause my heart is crying out.
I need a love song about now.
Don't need no ring tone songs now.
Please tell the DJ, slow it down.

I need a love song right now.
Remember when we used to slow dance.
And everybody used to electric-slide.
We'd be partying the whole night.
And we took it home,oh baby.
Rock the boat to the radio, don't ya' know, I miss it all right now.
Cause my heart is crying out.
I need a love song about now.
Don't need no ring tone songs now.

"They heard me singing and they told me to stop,
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock,
These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose,
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface.
'Cause on the suburbs the city lights shine,
They're calling at me, 'come and find your kind.'
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small,
Then we can never get away from the sprawl,
Living in the sprawl,
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains,
And there's no end in sight,
I need the darkness someone please cut the lights.
We rode our bikes to the nearest park,
Sat under the swings, we kissed in the dark,
We shield our eyes from the police lights,
We run away, but we don't know why,
And like a mirror these city lights shine,
They're screaming at us, 'we don't need your kind'
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small,
Then we can never get away from the sprawl,
Living in the sprawl,

This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low
The curtains are down
There's no one here

Say your lines
But do you feel them
Do you mean what you say
When there's no one around
Watching you, watching me

I've always been in love with you
I've guess you've always known it's true
You took my love for granted why oh why
The show is over say good-bye
Say good-bye, say good-bye
Make them laugh
It comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart
Hide behind your smile

Wish you well
I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
No more masquerade
You're one lonely star

Say we're just too political,

Judged by the elitist chosen few.

Once again arcane rain fell - cold, sorrowful and so frail
O, those weeping times, all of my life's a lie
An endless torrent of anguished tears' o behold my cry
The affliction of a stained creation becometh my tragedy
Lachrymose is the light - touching the buried again
O, this scenery of loss always present within me
Afar into the obscure I wish I now could soar
Even though he stole my pride - I stand above his lies
Even though I oceans cried - and sailed them far and wide
...my star shall ever shine
Drifting endlessly deep in darkened streams;
The inharmonious looms
In my doleful ocean lies the love I've lost...
...for heaven, my sorrow
Devour my soul as I enter the dark and cold
Fallen from heaven's domains - god's vengeance unfolds
This scenery of loss, a ruined empire of dismay;
A pathway of decay leading afar and always astray.
Even though he stole my pride - I stand above his lies
Even though I oceans cried - and sailed them far and wide...
...my star shall ever shine
""Homage he has from all - but non from me...
I battle it against him, as I battled in highest heaven - through all eternity,
And the unfathomable gulfs of hades, and the interminable reals of space,
And the infinity of endless ages... all, all, will I dispute""",Metal

I understand all the problems I'm about to express to you
Are things you already know
Well here goes nothing
Dear lord I am on my knees and I'm begging please
Just guide me father this time I'm really in need
Feeling like I just can't go on, mama cryin' and she lost her home
Tears runnin all down her face, judge gave her ten days to be gone
My god what I'm gon' do now, so stressed that the day go by
Devil on me and I don't know why , beg mama just please don't' cry
Times get a little rough I know, when it come to givin' up I don't
Got twins and they on their way, see 'em starve in the bed I won't
Sometimes I ask myself would I be a good father
'Cause I've never had mine, would I give the world to my daughters
Live and you learn, reap what you sow
Regardless of wealth, grind like ?

Only lord knows what the hell I dun' really been through
All the nights I ain't have no food
Dear god tell me what I'm gonna do
Man only lord knows all the times I was under my grind
He helped what I never could find, reach out when I couldn't get a dime
Man only lord knows, lord knows, lord knows
Man only lord knows what the hell I dun' really been through
All the nights my mama couldn't move
And all the pain I dun' put her through
Man only lord knows
And I'm sick and tired of this pain
Hate the lames in this game only down because of my name
Rock Swiss because of my fame
Lord knows the road where I came, lord know the nights that I cried
Can't help the pain that's inside, lord wipe the tears from my eyes
Ever seen the letter of eveiction, no place to go but you wishin
That a blessing come and you lifted, yeah dog that's all in my vision
I dun' been through hell and them trenches, I dun' seen the best of them fall
Lost a couple of my dogs, miss them niggas like shit
But they still reside in my heart, sore, ached and I'm scarred
I''ma do it for Dale and Four Fifth, God damn it's hard
Motherfuck this rapping, I really live this shit
Blood, sweat and tears, I really live this shit

And everyday that I wake, I grind, no time never wait for mine
Still waiting on the day I shine my soul, every bar, every line
I remember when I had no food, lights off, bills overdue
Lord knows that I've paid my dues, won't forget when I got that news
They say my mama sickly thank god she seen her fifties
I pray and ask forgiveness, please lord just keep her with me
I was down and out, remember that like yesterday
Made it out that struggle bracket, this year I'm blessed to say
Man this world's so fucked up, gas prices are way too high
Time's hard and I ain't gon' lie, bust ass just to try and get by
So who the hell is y'all to be judging, made it away from literally nothing
Yeah I'm talking literally nothing

For keeping me

Had the promise of a perfect summer
Blue eyed boy with a red TransAm
We spent hours on his hood just laughing
In between the moonlight dancing
It was way too short but oh so sweet

Black vinyl seats and Crackerjacks
With plastic rings they play it back
That goodbye scene on a warm September night
That's why I hate river roads with the windows down
And Tupelo, oh I hate that town
'Cause all I know, that's where he was bound
And he never did come back, that's why I hate Pontiac's
I filed away my wounded pride
I found someone and loved again
Never take a trip to way back when
Till the radio plays a certain song
And it's like a finger on the trigger
Some old hurts they just hurt bigger
Might have gotten past it long ago
But parts of yesterday
They get tattooed on your soul

With plastic rings they play it back
That goodbye scene on a warm September night
That's why I hate river roads with the windows down

'Cause all I know, that's where he was bound
And he never did come back
That's why I hate Pontiac's

So wild and free, till he took it back
That he loved me and he drove off like the wind

I laughed you off a long time ago.
Your ever changing personality never fails to tickle me at all.
You said you were a white witch,
Reminds me of a movie that you'd seen.
Well can you still open doors with just your mind?
In this little space in time, I've played with better things.
Everything you done...
The games you said you'd won - I still remember all to well.
The foes that fought and lost - the fools that bore your cross - I still
remember all to well.
And it's all a state of mind.
I've seen you crave affection,
Affected minds don't work too evenly.
Well what did you call it when you stabbed me in the back?

Where do you find redemption? Tucked away in pre-recorded dreams?
Do you wake each morning wondering when it came?
The experiments in pain no longer here in my world",Rock

"Tonight with another I'm dancing and we're smiling at the rest of the crowd
But I can't help wondering about you and your new love to whom you're so proud
At night I'm never alone I'm afraid that I'll weaken and phone
And I'm afraid that you will be gone I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
I still have the picture you gave me you signed it with love you'll recall
And the one of me that you wanted isn't now hanging face to the wall
At night I'm never alone
As long as I can keep smiling maybe I can fool the world don't you see
And perhaps some day I'll forget you and lose this heartache that you left with me
At night I'm never alone",Country
"I was born one mornin',
The rain a-pourin' down,
Heard my mammy say to my pappy,
""Let's call him John Henry Brown.""
CHORUS:
Walk on, boy; walk on down the road;
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
A-gonna help you carry your load.
I left my mammy and pappy
Just about the age of ten;
Lord, I got me a job a-workin' on the levee
Totin' water for the hard workin' men.
CHORUS:
Walk on, boy; walk on down the road;
Ain't nobody in this whole wide world
A-gonna help you carry your load.
One day my pappy told me,
""Some advice I wanna give to you --
Son, find a good woman, be good to her,
An' she's gonna be good to you.""
CHORUS:
Walk on, boy; walk on down the road;
There ain't nobody in this whole wide world
A-gonna help you carry your load.
If anyone should ever ask you,
""Just who is that fella Brown?""
You can tell him I'm the boy
Who left his hammer smokin'
Where he beat that steam drill down.

Walk on, boy; walk on down the road;
There ain't nobody in this whole wide world
A-gonna help you carry your load.
Walk on boy, walk on boy,
Walk on, boy.",Country
"Take the wave now and know that you're free
Turn you back on the land face the sea
Face the wind now so wild and so strong
When you think of me, wave to me, and send me a song
Don't look back when you reach the new shore
Don't forget what you're leaving me for
Don't forget when your missing these souls
Love must never hold never hold tight but let go
O the nights will be long
When I'm not in your arms
But I'll be in the song
That you sing to me across the sea
Somehow someday
You'll be faraway so far from me
And maybe one day I will follow you
In all you do
'Till then send me a song
When the sun sets the water will fire
When the winds swells the sails ever higher
Let the call of the bird on the wind
Calm your sadness and lonleness
And then start to sing to me
I will sing to you if you promise
To send me a song
I'll walk by the shore and I hear
Hear your song come so faint and so clear
And I catch it a breath on the wind
And I smile and I sing you song
I will send you a song
I will sing you a song
I will sing to you if you promise to send me a song",Folk

Is this what they write those songs about, maybe so
Your whispers echo inside my heart, your kiss is still on my lips

Something in the way I melt
I know just one thing, it's nothing like I've ever felt
Boy, this ain't just something, this is really something else
I don't know where this is gonna go, I don't know where it might end

And suddenly all these thoughts on life crept into me somehow
The sun has barely risen to lay aside another night
And it's here I settle softly into every word I write
Maybe I'm just counting up my sheep too late
But I just let them run beyond the fence
What good are guards that wouldn't give such pleasure?
I think I'll have a morning, one that starts out with a laugh
In the hopes that it would spread out equal on behalf
Of an unforgiving measure, oh where find time just ticks away
To let the simple things bring you closer in a simple way",Folk

You do everything you can to satisfy
I never mean to do the things I know I sometimes do

Down metal snake corridors steely grey
Engines hum for nobody but me

No messages crackles through the radio leads

How strange life in dark water can be
Oh mariners spare a thought when you pass
Those who live the submarine life
Far in the deep sonar eyes never sleep
Hiding like a shadow in the night
Jet planes nose through the clouds above me
They look for radar traces of me to see
They'll never know, never no never
How strange life in dark water can be
Wonder what the stars look like
Coming out tonight
Tell my girl she must be strong
She sits and waits all night long
Just looking for a better day
She'll have to find another way to go

Know I got the heat up under
Not up under the seat, up under my cheek
Like so close to me that when I move it squeaks
I ain't no big buff dude I'm a rap singer
I exercise one muscle that's my strap finger
And I can't call it how I see it no more
Cause these niggas'll take ya words back and twist em' like a pretzel
And these bitches be the same too
Comin' with that sob story crocodile tears trying to gang you
And that's exactly what the game do
And if you ever get caught dirty with a nigga she gon' blame you
So what in the hell you want to floss her for?
It's supposed to be bout' what a baller nigga cost that ho 
You givin' a game of black eye in ya S-5
While you niggas kick back poppin' X you let that 'cause' dry
And that bitch supposed to carry her own car note 
And don't be going for that shit ""I got a sore throat"" 
Give that bitch a couple of Sucrets 
Or give that that ho that application down on Vernon to that duplex

Want to tell your friends that you fucked with A

Do we play ball? Do we move that weight?
All I got for a motherfuckin ho is hate
Bitch want to get drunk and high
Point that booty on to the sky
Square ass bitch go bake a pie
Get a tattoo of a dick in ya eye
Want to be flied call Continental

"Verse one:
Let me get to the point real quick
When ya pockets are thick
Mad chicks be on a brothers tip
When ya sportin jewels and drivin in a groovy car
All the ho's go sweat you like a movie star
To get in ya pockets
Thats what the girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only nock boots when you got loot
You on the map
Cause if you broke youll get a wack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear,long hair and a cute face
And if ya live alone she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then ya start loosin all ya bucks
Soon your brothers a joke a not a rut?
Then she takes off and brakes off
Ya ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
Cause when you on top everythings ok
But when you broke you get no play
Chorus:
If you don't got endz you wont be gettin no skinz
And if you don't got money you wont skoop a honey
If you don't got cash you wont be gettin no ass
And if you don't got loot you wont be knockin no boots
Verse two:
Girls of the 90's ain't nuthin but crooks
Its all about what's in ya pockets not how ya look
That's why you cant talk to just any whore
Leavin brothers for the next man cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but allways askin for a dollar
And if you pushin a fresh benz they'll be ya best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect endz
You think she's all yours
But as soon as your dough go your ho go
Now you solo
But when you was makin papers sucker jumped ho's
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was takin em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke the girls not speakin
Cause nowadays girls want you to crook
The only thing they can get from big l is a big....
Cause when you on top everythings ok
But when you broke you gets no play
Chorus 2x
Verse three:
I tell it how it is cause I'm a goldfigga
And I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. golddigger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me askin me can they get some money
I'm lookin nuthin like ya poppa
I wouldnt give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo showbiz i'ma break it down like this

Outro:
It's like that y'all, and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's big l y'all, I'm livin swell yall

Of happy time I spent so long ago

Have all passed on now like the melted snow
So I'll spend my days in endless roving
Soft is the grass my bed is free

On that long road down to the sea

On marble stone there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her

"She's working at an office
Where nobody ever notices a thing she does
She knows that it's because
She ain't the kind you see in a magazine
The men keep talking about
Basketball and coffee, never bat an eye
Whenever she walks by
But at 5 o' clock in the parking lot
Her husband's waiting by the car
And she can't wait to see his face light up
Everybody's beautiful to someone
Everybody's beautiful to someone
She might not do much for you, son
But you should see what she does for someone else
Saturday morning and your wife says
She's going out to buy some eggs
While she slides her legs
Into her jeans with the ripped up knees
You're thinking to yourself
That she will look a little better
If her hair was long
Just a touch of make up on
When she smiles at you, says, ""Be back soon""
You don't know she's going
Just to hear the sack boy say, ""Hey, here she comes""
Everybody's beautiful to someone
Everybody's beautiful to someone
When she don't do much for you, son
You should see what she does for someone else
She might not do much for you, son
Everybody's beautiful to someone
Oh, everybody's beautiful to someone
She might not do much for you, son
Oh, but everybody is beautiful to someone
Yeah, you got to know
Oh, you got to hold her and kiss her and touch her
'Cause she's beautiful",Pop

Fuck on the couch  BIATCH! BIATCH!

UHHH!
My main batch in the front yard finna fight my other batch
Try'na grab each other by each other hair and pull out a patch
Both of them got Vaseline on they face so they both don't get scratched
My neighbors ain't trippin  cause they use to that
The police don't response cause they know they won't be right back
Togetha, foreva, like that? Yup like that
Never Chris Makin under? even though pressure bust sprits
My bitch got my back whether I'm wrong or I'm right
I'm a gangsta and not no little management psychosanian bad
A lightway part time convenience she like when I make her laugh
The other day we was jsut kickin it at powwowing and shit
Have a breakfast at the waffle house, cheese eggs and grits
Then all of a sudden come rushing some on mysterious bitch
Talking and hooping and hollering bout she pregnant and shit
I reached back as far as I can go I can get
Then I slapped the shit out that hoe with the back of my fist

It's just me 
And my bitch 
She hates my guts 
And makes me sick 
I curse her out 
She cuss me out

Seems like everytime a nigga get home 
A nigga done did sumthin wrong 
Caught me sex texting on the smart phone 
I'm like ""what the fuck is this bitch on? "" 
Her parents don't really like her cause we know we be on that thug love
And they don't get off in our business cause comments thicker than blood
But her brothers be try'na to test me size me up and mean mug
But they know that I pack that iron and I'm glued with the gloves
For the most part we cool and I respects they gangsta
I gotta baby by they sister we family I ain't no stranger
Me and my bitch got one of them love/hate relationships we some fools
Break up to make up then fuck cussing arguing infused
She don't wanna see me with her and I don't wanna she her with you
But the problem with me and her is all we do is accuse
But at the end of the fuckin day, I'm her man not her mouse
She got mo money than me, but I wear the pants in this house 

It's just me 
And my bitch 
She hates my guts 
And makes me sick 
I curse her out 
She cuss me out

"Well the mountain was so beautiful
That this guy built a mall and a pizza shack
Yeah, he built an ugly city because
He wanted the mountain to love him back

When you drop your tools and you stand alone
Hey, what do you love more than love

I held my breath and I packed my bags
And I went to the land of the monastery
And the sunshine children and the prayer flags

Hey, what do you love more than love
When you feel your soul go beyond your skin
When you know that's the way that it's always been
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
Well, I climbed a mountain and I thought about attachment
And I thought about the Buddhist King
He said, ""You can keep your superpower
It just short circuits my country""

Hey, what do you love more than love
When you question what your desire is for
When you don't just figure that you just want more
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
Well, I love the way the world is your garden
And you plant your seeds and you let them grow
And you take things out of the ground just like
You take what comes, but you never know
Yeah, and the mountain is so beautiful
And we don't know if we're any good at all
And we give our love when we think we still need it
Yeah we give and give and fall and fall

"Sie sind ein Pärchen, doch ein schönes
Pärchen sind sie nicht.
Ihn nennen wir Supermann, sie nennen wir
Mondgesicht.
Neulich kriegte ich vom Postboten einen
rostroten Brief
dieser beiden Frosttoten,wo drin die zwei mir mit einer
Wohnungseinweihungsfeier
und freier Kost drohten.
So denn! Ich schenkte irgendein
WC-Accesoire,
weiß schon nicht mehr was es war - ein
Seifenhalter?
Öh, nö 'n Föhn - von wegen nasses Haar.
Das ist zwar nicht schön aber praktisch
und gegen Erkältung prophylaktisch.
Es gab soviel knackfrisches Essen.
Keine Delikatessen hatten sie vergessen
und so fraß ich, und es war an sich ganz
spaßig.
Für den Sinn der meisten Gäste fehlte mir
indes die Klarsicht.
Den Dj machte Burkhard, n' guter
Handballtorwart.
Sein Gesicht zierte ein schokoriegelgrosser
Schnurrbart.
Musikalische Vorfahrt hatte stets Rock 'n'
Roll,und ich hab' ernsthaft überlegt, ob ich ihm
CDs zocken soll.
Toll, auch Supermann und Mondgesicht
präsentierten ihre Künste aus dem
Tanzunterricht.
Ganz unter sich schwoften beide, Backe an
Backe.
Sie kleben halt aneinander,wie die Fliegen an der Windschutzscheibe.
Tja, was man sich einbrockt, hat man auch
auszubaden
und ich zog es daher vor mich jetzt selber
auszuladen.
Supermann und Mondgesicht - anzurufen
lohnt sich nicht!
Ich hab die zwei neulich im Bus getroffen.
Die beiden Hand in Hand - ich die Buddel
und sturzbesoffen.
Ich so: Hi!"". Sie so: Hallo, wie geht's denn
so?"" Und selbst?"" Muß ja!""
Ich wußt ja schon am Start, die Fahrt wird
hart,
doch ich fand's trotzdem amüsant, was
aber daran lag,
daß er, wenn er von sich erzählt hat,
immer in der Mehrzahl sprach.
Er und sie waren einmal zwei Personen,
heute sind sie nur noch eine.
Es gibt sie nur im Doppelpack und keinen
mehr alleine.
Ich hab gehört, einmal im Monat wird das
Treppenhaus gebohnert.Supermann ist der Mann für jede Tonart
und wenn er mal ein Sohn hat wird der
sicher ebenso
....laaangweilig, doch lebensfroh.
Irgendwo ist Mondgesicht ja auch sehr
familiär.
Manchmal denk ich, daß sie gern seine
Mami wär.
Alles geregelt, weil sich beide regelmäßig
sehen,
nur ihre Regel kommt nicht regelmäßig,
und das ist nicht so schön.
Doch ansonsten ist alles echt dufte,vor allem das Paföng, was Supermann für
sie gekauft hat.
Der Bus riecht nach Mondgesicht und sie
wie 'ne Blumenwiese.
Diese Brise - ich krieg hier echt 'ne Krise.
So vollgelabert hab ich kurz mit meinem
Schicksal gehadert,
sagte aus: Ich muß jetzt raus -hier steht
mein Fahrrad.""
Es war gelogen und im nachinein auch kein
kluger Zug,
weil mein Heimweg noch mehrere
Kilometer betrug.

lohnt sich nicht!",Hip-Hop

Is the most precious thing on earth

And I can't help
Livin' that way

Don't want my baby
To hurt for a thing

Playing from the start
And our love's becoming

One day soon, you'll let me go
It's gonna hurt, it's gonna
Hurt me so inside
So if you don't wanna
Don't want to see my cry
Please don't ever, ever say goodbye
Just straighten up your heart

And we can start anew
And if you do this for me
I'll know your loving is true

So straighten up your heart

Over troubled, troubled water
You stood beside me, stood beside me
And your love, did not falter

Gave me the strength to know,
That I will get through,
And that's how I survived, ain't no other reason
And now I know I'll make it, through the miracle of you

But I won't give birth till you insert yourself inside of me
I hear you whining, baby lively

My back wings give the hardest slap that you've ever seen
Figures of 8 around your face
Elaborate, your eternity
You're so fucking fake that it's hurting me
I'm just jealous cause you're more alive than what I'll ever be

Not only on they weak careers but it's a setback on yours
So step back, endure the rain, the suffer and pain
You want a problem?
Here's a death match, it's war
Fuck Horseshit Gang they straight lame, all four suck
I put 500k on this battle, you put yours up?
You poor bums couldn't afford a sweater from Nordstrom's
After this shit is finished, niggas better reward us
My girl's 'gram has more likes than yours does
How does it feel to have never been on a tour bus?
It's probably similar to alcohol on a sore cut
You niggas suck; in other words niggas, you're fucked
You really thought we wouldn't stop you? Please
Fuck you mean? We'll puncture you and watch you bleed
See I patrol the game daily like the cops do streets
I'm too beast, niggas we will rock you; Queen
For real, it's like your buzz is invisible, dang
You don't even have residuals, game
From your predictable lane
Your song sucks so you ain't getting no fame
Nobody even knows you nigga's individual names

Y'all done stepped in some horse shit
I'll turn you horseshoe niggas to corpses
For a dollar and a snack I bet they blow a horse dick
I ain't want to murk them but fuck it, you niggas pushed me
I'd let you fuck my wife but I'm sorry, she don't like pussy
I'm bending corners, let you broke niggas ride along
What bunch of fucking gangsters, but they can't afford a firearm
I know you need guap, take a moment to breathe Doc
Bet they do the drive-by on a bike with a slingshot
Y'all basic, lookin' like you need bathing
Call me cause my grandmama got room in the basement
You could never shit on me, you should lend your bitch to me
We stock you up with canned goods and give you free publicity
500K but we doin' this one for charity
Stackin' bread like I'm Sara Lee, you should be very scared of me
Fire marshall build, you faggots can get extinguished
On Sway lookin' like some broke R&B; singers
What you? Ron, Bobby, Ricky and Mike?
Must be smokin' that hard and sniffin' that white
See this rap shit ain't workin', you niggas should get a fuckin' job
Nah seriously, niggas get a fuckin' job
I feel bad for any man that can't afford a meal
Tell Mike Trampe to learn how to count a half a mil'

Houston to Horseshit, come back down to Earth
Ain't you niggas in your 40s like this rappin' gon' work?
Aye your bitch said she tired of hearin' them lame rap dreams
Pay a bill, nigga, shit is not happening
Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
Fuck happened to you?
Bitch I'm back in the booth and I'm spittin' it for the homeless
Serial killer, I murder all my opponents
Let me break it down, don't think you niggas gon' make it
You got a better chance at gettin' hit by a spaceship
But I'ma pray for 'em, dear Lord, please bless the bum niggas
I know they're starvin', please help 'em out with a lunch, would you?
Drop 'em all, linoleum, who gassed 'em like petroleum?
Get murked by me, Dizz and that nigga from Nickelodeon
Dame said he hirin', we need some custodians
I bet your label fuck you in the ass with no petroleum
Mr. Benton, I'll abort you lames
Can somebody spare some change for the Horseshoe G.A.N.G.?
Bitch

Look man, I didn't wanna do it to y'all niggas, man
I liked y'all niggas, you know what I'm sayin'?
But goddamn, y'all pushed us, man
We didn't even call your name
We know y'all niggas ain't got money
Your goddamn Motown, Philly, suit wearin' ass nigga
Old goddamn Boyz II Men lookin' nigga
MC Brain, goddamn tied shirt wearin' ass nigga
Old goddamn r&b; singer lookin' mothafuckas
Man, aye fuck this shit, Dizzy
You niggas done fucked up
I'ma light the dizzy, OG
I'ma let my lil' nigga get you
Bad career move, nigga
I ain't even wastin' no time, we got canned goods, nigga
We gon' help feed y'all niggas
Let's go!

So you the fuck niggas that want it first
My stomach hurts so somebody finna get shitted on
My vision long and I coulda seen this from a mile away
You niggas is endin' your careers, we comin' up out the gate
Now you can't escape, the nerve of this man
I'm El Chapo sendin' these Donald Trumps their surgery plans
Emergency land
You can tell we the current demand
Y'all ain't hungry, you bitches thirsty, here's a courtesy can
You niggas obviously not hungry enough, it's tough to see it
So how can you believe a crooked eye certainly can?
Yo fuck a Horseshit Gang., this a burglary
We studied niggas thoroughly and I promise y'all won't make it this far
Let me bird, you pussy niggas shoulda just stayed in the car
I'm breakin' laws, jaws 'til faces get taken apart
I'm appalled, you fuckboys done stepped out of your league
Y'all ain't makin' no moves so it's awkward you wanna battle with speed
Now what the game need? Not another offbrand Shady group
Half a mil'? Y'all label got you out here eatin' baby food
Fuck it, now I'm your necks, y'all borin' so you're formin'
Formulatin' checks, I heard the diss, but ain't nobody take the bet
We crowded around the mic, playin' games with your life
All four of y'all sound alike, we blowin' up like dynamite
Nigga that's a high explosion
We gettin' booked for the same shows that y'all was tryna open
Homie knowin' that I'm flowin'
Stop it with the foolishness, middle finger up
I'm screamin' fuck your group of duplicates
I'm on my King Kunta shit
Ready for the battle, Shady nigga better skidaddle
You're in someone else's shadow, guarantee this make 'em fragile
Cause I'm an active activist
Y'all got a platform with no fan base
No hate but how mothafuckin' sad is this?
How's this happenin', aren't you niggas concerned
Y'all sound like every fuckin' fast rapper that I've ever heard
But I ain't mad at all, I checked out y'all catalog
Haters of the trap music but signed a deal with a trap involved
I'm just a nigga that tatted over his battle scars
You niggas fallin' off so you don't got no room to call nobody soft
You not the coldest
You tight, but shit, my tight is claustrophobic
You don't know it, 'til the side effects show you can't control it
Now it's in the open, all this for promotion
Y'all elevator goin' down and everybody knows it
According to the lie detect, who gon' sign the check?
Y'all better hit the streets
Ask your label and they look at y'all niggas in disbelief
Y'all better stick to kissin' feet 'fore I crack your grill
I hate a bitch nigga that'll settle for a Happy Meal
Have your bitch attracted to the daddy skills
Pass it on but I crashed into 'em with the caddy steel
Fuck these niggas
We already won, onto the next round
Y'all stagnant, already paralized from the neck down
Tryna battle us with the tech style
Why try nigga? Bodied by the high nigga
Didn't know I was battlin' the do or die niggas
Fuck Horseshit G.A.N.G. in 20-15, nigga
Yeah y'all buried alive already, fuck y'all
Sleep in your casket tonight, nigga
Don't step out of your league no more, nigga
Get some fans before you try to get in a rap battle, fuckboy

The boy hide his grits, the boy pot ain't grits
Might use a microwave if I'm tryna do it quick
Tryna clock the yay and the fork, that's water whipped
And sit in on the paps, dry it, I lose a pinch
But what the fuck is the point when you're dealing with joints boy
Whole birds, covert with us, so no choice

And if I hurt her feelings who gives a fuck
I'm out for myself, bout to make me a smooth cover
I keep it on the under in a closet on the hush hush
On my way to victories downtown surplus
To get a blend aqua windbreaker
To match blue latchin' vendeta

Yeah, murderism I'm doin' niggas in
So give up the ghost my nigga
Remember me, I used to be your main nigga
But fuck ya, I'm jealous and I hate ya fuckin' guts

I'll take that cartridge out and set it on the range
Prepare for the jack if ya sellin' coke

As long as I got me a strap, I'm never broke

A playa hater starvin' like Somalia
You got some yo-yo
Cause I'm right back chokin' again
Chokin' mo' now before I did when I went in
Tomorrow I got to go take a piss test for real
I'm tryin' to clean out my system with stay clean and golden seals
But I'm gon' be late, I'm on vacation
Because it's too early for me to go back on a violation
Fuck my P.O. I need some M-O
N-E-Y so I can get high and kick in this nigga's door
It's four in the morning I'm on a mission peep
The best time to catch a nigga in his sleep
Wake ya ass motherfucker I know ya rich
Tell me where the fuck is yours, I'ma bust ya bitch
Do dick in ya greasel I tie him up
And made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke
Do dick in ya greasel I tie him up
Then I made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke

I looked at pop and said ""You must got a lil' dick""
Havin' shame he was cryin' like a toddler
Nigga couldn't stand here baby scream and holler
I said ""You got one mo' time nigga where is the minl""
He said ""It's in the den right corner, top vent""
Folks remember that I'm scandalous and anti-fuckless
I carry diseases such as herpes and nut pluckers
Nutted in the bitch, kissed her on her lips
Made her get up and suck a little dick
The bitch had her some play though
Ya know she deep throat my big ol'
I dropped my strap like a sucker would
She said ""How does it feel"" I said ""Good""
She said ""You know this ain't the way to mix business with pleasure""
I said ""I know this ain't the weather to make miserable pleasure""
You know this ain't the weather to mix business and pleasure
Shit, she tried to bite off my pecker
Helped rex loose, I hangin' juice
And after juice you beggin' for this shit
Like you gon' knock it out better
Picked up my tech up off the ground
Pistol whipped, tied up sittin' down
I need a black screwdriver but a butter knife will do
To the vent I went to collect all my due
Struck out the side of boss game steward
Hopped in my hoo-ride made a left on Newark
Through the dark alleys black this black that
As long as I got me a strap look I'm never broke, yeah
I'm never broke

Oh I see
So what you're saying is a girl
Is something like an investment
Keep your revenues up to par
And all you need is a strap
Precisely that's how motherfuckers make them fat lick-backs
See I'm way respected in the rap industry
Cause I skip, spit that real-life type shit
Feel it, so let's hustle up the true motherfuckers

"I was young and I was stupid, I had just turned seventeen
I took my hits on a dumb road trip to Nashville Tennessee
I packed my antihistamines and Tupperware drums
A harmonica and a box guitar
In a canvas covered wagon stuff with apples and with guns
We quietly slipped across the border into Arkansas
But still we couldn't find what it was we were looking for
So we trucked on down to try our luck along the Rio Grande
But I couldn't help but notice how
The little things that used to make us happy, made us sad
But still I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
I never would've got here if I'd followed my heart
I didn't think much of it till I took it apart
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
We never ever made it down to Nashville in the end
And no one ever signed our stupid country disco band
However hard we tried, it never seemed to be enough
We never did get famous
Still it made us kind of happy and it kept me off of drugs
And now I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
I never would've got here if I'd followed my heart
I didn't think much of it till I took it apart
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star

Turned to rust,

Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?

In the forests of eternal dreaming
Old oaks lighted up by the fullmoon's light
The coldness of dungeon touches the inside of wooden maze
From the womb of the mother-wolf I was born
The witches foretold in the hearts of my enemies
In the midnight wilderness I took a pledge
Quickly I fell in love with the taste of steel
For ages waiting for its denudation
The final triumph
The pure barbarity
I howl to the moon for support in my battle
The moon, symbol of purity, the essence of beauty
I damn the sun, rising again and again
In brightness of bloody light, steel holocaust
I received hails from the northern side
of snowcovered Carpathians
The light breath of nightmare, as a sign
I summon the iron powers, cavalry of my brothers
From the land of armageddish fields
I am the bard of eastern lands...
I lead my brothers for death struggle
In glory of victory my armies rise
Barbarian tribes with fury of destruction
With axes reach the sky, hiding usurpator in their wings
Call the clouds, desecrating all the holiness
Hurt bodies on the snow, Pandemonium burns
This battle is a rebellion, rebirth of old traditions
Mythical hell is the paradise to the true warriors
There they attain eternity and sit high on the throne
Pagan nations became united
Mighty bards received their long awaited silence
Slavs returned to their villages and woods
Pagan frights of heavenly hell dispelled
...I opened the door to the higher than stars knowledge
And took a long walk throughout the unknown dimensions
As the sign of fullmoon, in damnation I shall rise",Metal
"If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right
How long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Do you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks, not of kin
People must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation, would make a better society
Now some of us would rather cuss and make a fuss
Than to bring about a little trust
But we shall overcome our beliefs someday
If you'll only listen to what I have to say
And how long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Can you respect your brother's woman friend

"Oh my broken battered body
In the days when I was younger
Used to fix itself quick sharp
After every slip and stumble
But these days I'm collecting scars that don't seem to fade
Cuts and bruises that won't go away
And I used to think that I
Would never live past twenty five
And when you think like that, each day
Is a gift if you survive
But I've survived too long for my side of the deal
And as I reach that shore I'm not sure how to feel
'Cause I keep losing days
That used to take a lifetime
In the blinking of an eye
And all these small ideas
Are suddenly commitments
As greatness slips on by
Greatness slips on by
I remember well the day that I got my first tattoo
I was so scared before and after I was so proud when it was new
But these days I've gone and got me many more
And sometimes I get more when I get bored
One for every year I've lost",Indie

They didn't help

"Cheer up!
'Cause nothing really matters when you look up into outer space
It's a great big world and there's no need to cry
Cheer up!
We're all interconnected to the reaches of the galaxy
And my best friend says he came from the sky
He traveled to the Earth aboard a pink spaceship,
It's hard for him to hide behind those eyes
Cheer up!
The atoms in your body are as old as every dinosaur
You're a special part of one big grand design
Cheer up!
We're all in this together to discover what we're living for
Thirteen billion years and there's still time
Every night I wish upon a star so bright,
Waiting for the others to arrive

Runnin' wild
Watch a while
You see he never smiles
Broken home
Father gone
Mama tired
So he's all alone
Kind of sad
Kind of mad
Ghetto child
Thinkin' he's been had
In the back of his mind he's sayin'
Didn't have to be here
You didn't have to love for me
While I was just a nothin' child
Why couldn't they just let me be
Let me be, let me be, let me be
One room shack
On the alley-back
Control, I'm told
From across the track

Who'll make all things fair
He lives outside

You didn't have to love for me

Why couldn't they just let me be

Runnin' through ma' bones
I'm sorry son
All your money's gone
Painful rip
In my upper hip
I guess it's time
To take another trip
Don't care what nobody say
I got to take the pain away
It's getting worser day by day

"There was a girl I used to know
She was oh so beautiful
But she's not here anymore
She had a college degree
Smart as anyone could be
She had so much to live for
But she fell in love
With the wrong kinda man
He abused her love and treated her so bad
There was not enough education in her world
That could save the life of this little girl
How come, how long
It's not right, it's so wrong
Do we let it just go on
Turn our backs and carry on
Wake up, for it's too late
Right now, we can't wait
She won't have a second try
Open up your hearts
As well as your eyes
She tried to give a cry for help
She even blamed things on herself
But no one came to her aid
Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell
That's what we'd like to tell ourselves",R&B

There's nothing left to do
But move forward,

Right now we are not sure
But I hope it will get better
These times were in together, theyre changing us forever

And now they wont learn a single lesson except how to load a weapon
And right here on this old soil we hope for peace and we pray for joy

Choppin it up with the homies, havin visions of a glock 17
Niggas on my team can't wait to fill clip up
We jumpin out the barrel with my niggas, shootin shit up
See under niner ross, black talon, hollow tips flow
Aim me at the chest, I'm makin sure that vest don't get no love
Ain't even breathin, leave the body shittin like a seagull
See I'm illegal, I got pockets like that ? eagle
Fuckin around with me is danger, I'm talkin shit
Tryin to brainwash the trigger when I'm in the chamber
Don't give a fuck if it's a accident or on purpose
When I'm comin out the chamber, fool it's just inservice
Don't get nervous when you see what I do
I love to hit the target, and when I'm breakin that skin, ooh
Travel through his heart, ricochÃ©t off the nearest bone
Rip his insides up, shatter his spine, now I'm gone
Layin by the body, waitin for the FEDS
Swoop me up for evidence, then I'm just some melted led
It ain't no thang, got me back where I started
In a box, with my homies, waitin for my next target
Ha ha ha, the mothafuckin bullet
Shootin up shit everywhere
Every city in every state
Don't give a fuck about who when the bullet fly
The only thought that's on my mind is ""die nigga, die""

I seen a nigga ask for them black talons and grin
It won't be long 'til they let me loose
Got me in the clip, drinkin Gin with no fuckin juice
It's goin down, I know they ridin on some fools tonight
Hit the lights, squeeze the trigger, send me on my flight
Don't give a fuck about who I hit when I fly
The only thought that's on my mind is ""die nigga, die""
Women and children and babies, I know it's crazy
See I'm a bullet, it's my job, man that shit don't faze me
Even the hand that's on the trigger get shot too
Wherever the barrel aiming at, that's who I end up smokin fool
Don't get it twisted, I got no love for none of y'all
Got to dig a tunnel through your head, and watch the body fall
Just shoot and I'mma do the rest
I love givin young niggas cardiac arrests
Bullet-proof niggas, I go up in 'em quickly
The ambulance picked him up with shit all in his Dickies
Just cock the glock, put your finger on the trigger, pull it
And make a mothafucka feel the bullet
Ha ha ha, yeah
Another victim of these mothafuckin bullets
Once we pull the trigger, don't get nervous
'cause it's instant mothafuckin service
Ha ha ha, yeah
Breakin fools off every-mothafuckin-day

Up out the chamber, it's that sneaky mothafucka creepin
You heard a shot but didn't know until the blood was leakin
Up out your chest, you seen your flesh was a bloody mess
Dropped down on your knees, and ran outta breath
Sentanced to your death
Got hit by the wig splittin, shirt rippin, pistol wippin nigga
Catchin 'em slippin when they set trippin
Dippin and dabbin, you niggas know who I am, and
Can't be fuckin with them faulty heaters that be jammin
I love to fly and when they jam, I can't come out and kick it

Droppin bodies by the dozens, in and out your cousins

Ready to make the hit, talkin long shit, bitch
Hit the floor before I hit the door and split ya with some heat
Take your head and leave your body in the street
As I creep, up on my next mothafuckin victim
Sweep him off his feet, pull the trigger, let me sick him
Hit him high, hit him low, you know how it go
Put your finger on the trigger, pull it, the mothafuckin bullet
Ha ha ha, the mothafuckin bullet
Mobbin through your hood and takin head
Showin no mothafuckin remorse

How Imma sleep when I'm in the streets and I got beef.
On my block it's war; we live like we in Pakistan,
I got the mac in my pants, and I got crack in my hands.
I give it how you want it; I take it how it come.

Starting to all make sense
We began to blossom, so perfect
I'm starting to understand
And you have made this cove for us again
If this was any other day, surely just walk away
If this was any other day, surely just walk away
Working it out so perfect
A picture worth a thousand words
Can't believe we took it, so wasted

And I gather all myself for you
If this was any other day, surely just walk away

Spit it out
The words come out, yeah
it's already
not as heavy as before

"Waiting for a little sign
Seems like to no avail
Strolling down the pavement aimlessly
Waiting for someone to snatch her bag of memories
How come you call it destiny?
When the cross you bear's your only company
Never seen you, I don't even know you're name
But still I believe
That you are gonna save me
Somehow I got a notion
Just a little affection on this cold and windy road
Save me, from a state of un-emotion
Just a little affection on this windy road

Why's growing up hurt so bad?
Seek what we had lost, we get found and go again
I don't know what's gone to me
I won't make any promise I believe
Never seen you, I don't even know you're name

Light sabers my neighbors consist of
Mint cookies bent books keys three tennis balls
Peanut butter a Japanese chicken clock and when it falls
On eight thirty I'm hurting it's early and my hair is dirty
Teeth as if beneath a highlighter, just not pearly
Peeling armhairs harm their relation to the band-aid
The mucas formation is man made
I plan eight minutes more of sleep
I'm in it snorin deep
beep beep beep
When again it roars I keep my eyelids analagous to a succesful venus-fly trap
Tellin my left brain it's Saturday well he must buy that
Wakin up again I look around and find another year has passed
We're discovering
at last near a lover not so fast
here I'm hovering to make time slow down go back to last year
we'll meet again but the characters are never gonna be the same that's clear
I wanna see your name hand written on a letter whether this is planned or not
Life keeps getting better but still I just don't understand a lot
I'm growing up and up up out out damn this spot's
Similar to a ball I saw in a mall it expands and knocks me off course
Of course that's just how it goes
The farther I walk from my house the more my world grows
So I froze
Thinking bout being four years old I'm missing the
Days when I was with everyone I knew just around the Christmas tree
Now there's so many people and so many place s and so many faces that the only way
that I could ever get you all together would be to die
So you could ask what's the point of makin friends
You just end up forsakin them
Well god's given me life, so I'm livin. That's why
That's why I went to the bookstore
To look for a Zodiac sign book
Quick, search, find, look
Wrote it down in my rhymebook
To check and see if we're compatible I had to pull back my left arm
It said a libra plus another one is a double dose of charm

Time this is your time this is your time this is your brain

Fine this is your line this is your mind this is your brain

like bike seats when you spoke you turned my wheels now I can't handle the breaks

course of events every resource sent my brainwaves to the same thought content things
that had mattered before were laughable shattered at the door give it autobiographical
point of pivot week and the weekend before I wanted power but all that changed in an
hour movin over worlds when I met my dream lover the clover girls fell off the magazine

haven't sen you in a while one side left now I gotta walk single file come back soon
please even in a full classroom if you're not there then it feels like a vacuum in fact you
never really heard me attack you with every little word about what makes me attract to
the only girl I every wanna kiss ever throw rice with you're a priceless treasure a living
piece of bliss and pleasure so fuck this weather whatever if I hafta stop rappin I'm a
break into tears my head's ringing from the noises that you make in my ears so I'm stuck
now waitin a year don't give a fuck how I struck out what for goodness sake I'm here
father time patricide need you like an artery hopin that you cried a fraction as hard as me
relax an just pardon the expression but I love yo-no I love attraction, or I love my own
reaction added one to my self and I couldn't help meltin to nothin, subtraction
Been around the world been another year
I recover thoroughly And now I'm here
Like a mother pearl layer top of layer
Met another girl here comes the fear and the sheer joy
And the sheer bliss floating through the universe on a kiss
Lips slippin and I'm trippin grippin drippin doubt
Flippin out over just this? And I stay
Calm recite this song listen
Second verse connects fittin
Her with you and you with me and third verse needs remixin
I need a fifth one to say I keep meetin you under different conditions
Last one made my heart smart shit I wanna start right with this one
Now I'm with you, now I miss you, now I don't know when I'm gonna see you
And I'd like to and I'd love to and I maybe even wanna be you
So I'm thankful and I'm spiteful in the night pullin at you tight
Sank fully into the shadow you left recall
The strength of your bad breath
And the smell of sweat, bet another fella gets jealous me well it's not yet
I'd picture maybe we could get together in another place, another time signature
Hey hope you didn't mind this is your
Face painted in my rhyme

This is yours this is yours this is mine

Standing alone
With all the hopes we were floatin'
On the ground now, crushed and broken
And the sorrys left unspoken
To never be known
Red light, green light, go
Reaching out for the comfort of another soul Reaching out from a feeling that I've often known
All I want is a lover who will share the road Better get used to it
Speak from the truth of it
Stop watching red lights as they're fadin'

Be enough for me
See the man, understand, what he's all about
Take my hand, no demands
Only living in harmony

Not watching red lights as they're fadin'

Somebody help me cause I could hear the voices in the tube
To get me through anything I do and anything will do good by me
A little pill, a little thrill, should I take it I think I will
And anything will do good so as long as it's always too good

Watching the lake turn the sky into blue green smoke
The sun was setting to the left of the plane
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow
In 27D I was behind the wing
Watching the landscape roll out
Like credits on a screen
I said look, look to your left passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend that you're here from outer space
And this, this is your very first sight
The earth looked like it was lit from within
Like a big man-made electrical ball
Out of the farmlands and into the gri
The plan of a city was all that you saw
And all of these people sitting totally still
As the ground raced beneath them thirty thousand feet down
I said look, look to your left passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend that you're here from the fifth century
And this, this is your very first flight
Then I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video
The stewardess came back and checked on my drink
And I swear that she looked just like Brigitte Bardot
As I had on my walkman and I had on those eyes
That you get when your circumstance is movie size
And I said look, look to your left passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend the plane's going to crash in 5 minutes
And this, this is your very last sight
You better look, look to your left passengers
Look, look to your right
Cause I'm going to take this plane out in less than 5 minutes
And this, this is your very last sight",Indie
"When I was sixteen I cut myself a Mohawk,
Because I wanted to walk the walk,
And not just talk the talk,
But it was a bit of a disaster because
I did the sides with kitchen scissors,
Because I didn't have any clippers,
And I didn't want to use a beard-trimmer
I'd made that mistake before.
When you got home you didn't want to talk about what I'd done.
You said I'd let you down, I'd fucked around, when I was only having fun.
With the way that you've been lately, you've no right to scream and shout.
You and I, we've got a lot that we need to talk about.
What's the point in making vows that you're never going to keep?
A lifetime lying awake means you'll never get to sleep.
And all the promises you made, that were painful and untrue,
Of all the things you do they reflect worst on you.
We all have our own devices
For handling mid-life crises
Usually involves a motorbike and
Suspicious fashion decisions.
But you choose to stave off grey hairs by
Lamely hacking at the sides
With lies and flimsy alibis
For your suspicious expeditions.
When I get home I don't want to talk about what you've done.
Yes you've let me down, you've fucked around, but I guess you were having fun.
With the way that I've been lately, I've no right to scream and shout.
You and I, we've got a lot that we need to talk about.
You always told me Father's Day was just another way
Of selling Hallmark greeting cards
Twenty Years of waking sleep, of lying through your teeth,
Meant every Father's Day spent wondering who the hell you are.
What's the point in us making vows that we're never going to keep?

Long ago, from the wonderland
Was a girl named Eve
She came to Earth from the mermaid sea
That is when love began.
Speak of love inside you
With a mystic smile
Let us be beside you
Showed us how to be
But she's just here to stay with us awhile
There is much more to see
I'll be seeing you
Climb into the skyride for a better view
Let's make connection get on back in style
While we are here in the Venus Isle
Then Eve said, ""I miss you""
Now it's time to go
And, ""I love you""
This is not my home
A from her isle she said her goodbyes
And blasted off to the stars
So it starts with you
Let there be no secrets, all that we can do
Let's make a symphony of a thousand smiles

Get on the wagon and off of them damn cigarettes
But they ain't killed me yet
Doc you probably wonder why I don't care
Why I don't change, why I ain't scared
'Cause I thought her leavin'
Would stop my heart from beatin'
And gettin' over her would be my death
It hurts every night when she dances through my mind
I still feel the sting of loneliness
But it ain't killed me yet
She turned this house into a tomb
Ghosts rattle in every room, they're doin' their best
But they ain't killed me yet
So I lean on the bottle more every night
I'm probably past the point where I should give it a rest
But it ain't killed me yet
No I ain't sayin' I'll never die
But till I do, I'm on borrowed time
'Cause I thought her leavin'
Would stop my heart from beatin'
And gettin' over her would be my death

Positions run fluid honey ribbons create a quiver shiversdelivers
Ooh wee sweet haromony synchronicity the simplicity
Seven day kisses slide in you and me me me 
You messin' up my mind in the right way I'm ready to play and lay with you
Been savin' all my love for a lotta days I'm ready to spend what I saved on you

I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain 
I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain 
Don't know if rain drops or lust swellin' in my eyes
Want to stroke you and soak you but not just between your thighs
Your hips plus the way roll grips gets me swervin'
Job site visit exquisite lunch time excursions
Kitty cats purrin' wet lips get near then...
Skin parts start disappearin'
Earlobes get chewed up Hennessy poured in two cups
Downtown is looking delicious audio schooled up
Let's heat the mood up say what's on your mind
When bones grind, lips to ??? sippin on wine
Rhythmic tussles but not the struggle
Ever juggle raindrops strawberry snuggles?
Do what you want to
Let's take it outdoors with out your
There's no one without beds without floors
Plays our body softly like piano keys
Together explore, makin' the stormy breeze
I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain 
I wanna do it outside
I wanna do it in the rain
Erotic beads of rolling water tricklin'
And ticklin' swarms of moonlight kisses
Hips and thighs aligned in perfect nines and soft wet sixes
Wine and candy rain drop hor's devoures
To be dined from deep within your curves
We merge devinely on liquid missions
Climbing grinding finding climax with each position
Naked skin chills hair filled with rain
Caressing erect body tips next to me
It's ectasy when we play
Easing winds bring mounds of lust whisper three words we love to say
Dripping black laces, hidden places
Manicured hands around joysticks of passion
Splashing seeds of new beginning swimming on naked skin
Or trapped within thin lambskin walls
Windchimes and bells, erotic smells
Breath becomes deep, desire swells, desire swells
You messin' up my mind in the right way I wanna play and lay with you
Been savin' all my love for right one, I wanna spend it on you
I wanna do it outside 
I wanna do it in the rain

All of her heartbreak

Stand tall but above it all

I've found her not, not far from home
I should better get away from here
She's on her way to be another one
Playing with fire
She can read my thoughts
It's too late
Playing with her life
Tommyknockers brought her trouble
The ship in the earth I touch
A vibration is filling me
And music in my head
Nose is bleeding
And my fall down
Filled me up with pain

Ey! Oh! I'll get by, I'm not that other guy...
..who's probably been wondering where is it that you go
when you show up at 3 am with no explanation
another way another day another lifetime
well I might have been yours and well you might have been mine...
but I had you, I had you, I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed nibbling your ear
I had you, I had you, I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
it's not the best day, it's not the worst day
just a day that I knew would always come day
Such a shame that I'll never meet your mother
a part of me will miss you more than another
Ey! Oh! It was fun, you'll always be my number one
Ey! Oh! Sad but true, I guess I'm number two
another way another day another lifetime
well I might have been yours and well you might have been mine...
and still I had you, I had you, I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed nibbling your ear
I had you, I had you, I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
and everytime you used to smile at me, well it would set me free, and I could only be for you

we clearly never shared the same point of view

what's this? what can this be? 5 seats back on a flight to miami
there you are with a look of shock, you just can't wait for this boat to dock
call it coincidence or call it fate, I finally see you with your true soul mate
now I see the reason you wouldn't commit, you couldn't love me cuz you married a hobbit
still I had you, I had you, I had you my dear
not in your head but in your bed sucking on your ear
I had you, I had you, I had you in every way
though you were never mine you were my personal buffet
I had you, I had you, I had you even more
I fell in love with you, you just wanted to screw and walk out the door
I had you, I had you, something like 50 times

so coin poor

what can i say? i ask

"Far beyond the walls of all safety in a land
Disgusting as the highest of God's heavens
Starved hands keep appearing - clawing
Tearing shreds out of the flesh and mind
And as the sands crawl their unchanging path
All means seemingly focus towards the end
There is no reason to live anymore when the reason cannot be attained
But the solace lay beyond the darkness
In a land where light and life dwell
Yet soon will come death and the numbing fires
Only then will my mind lie to rest
For I am alone on this world
Enslaved and surrounded by the living dead
Yet still I stand tall as I bleed
Deep from within the cuts upon my skin",Metal

When hours have gone by, I'll close my eyes

But now hear my song about the dawn of the night
Let's sing the bards' song
Tomorrow will take us away far from home
No one will ever know our names but the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow will take it away the fear of today
It will be gone due to our magic songs
There's only one song left in my mind
Tales of a brave man who lived far from here
Now the bards' songs are over and it's time to leave
No one should ask you for the name of the one
Who tells the story
Tomorrow will take us away far from home
No one will ever know our names but the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow all will be known and you're not alone

"Stealing souls for an urge that was kept a secret
Fade in this memory, as these curses exit lips
Digesting the power of dead space filled with betrayal
This evolution has passed down these genetics of evil
This message woes, ripped of emotion
Conspiracy of poison, the target of bloodlust
Black veiled whisperers, touched by the wicked
Grey twilight of this might, a return from hell
As the bloodstained vision engulfs this purpose
Awaken in the eclipse of self consuming rebirth
Peeling back the skin of flame to rise up from this fire
These layers of apocalypse cover the sky in hatred
Memories washed away in corridors lined with decay
Demands by oblivious parasites of cradled fear
Fluids drained in this task of a souls devourment
Not a ray of light that breathes in this lack of hope
Unleash the morbid, hear the call of wounds
This misfortune rules with a plague of rot
Executing ritual mutilations of tradition
Personal damage of bitter movements in staggered thought
Scarification of entrance to this chaos
Swine of forever, butchering the ageless
Suffocate them with this fire
In strikes of rage flesh is torn by thorns that crown kings
Effigy of a frozen vision severed of limbs, cast from the bone of angels
Distinct venomous behavior, placed on this pedestal of the revealing terror
This evocation of wrath
These words that will take all life
A mouthful of revenge
Choke on the virus spreading within, soaring deeper into the solar burn
Entwined in the lateral movement above,
Flesh covered grounds of massacre
Only the most deviant of these supplicants,
Will have forged the new worlds vision",Metal
"Turn the bars into cars
And wait for the lights to change
And take shape of people we used to know
'Til they grow less fond of knowing
And we can ride in the night
And discard all the facts on our backs
Remembering the thoughts we thought
Since we got over our parents
And if we go where we go
And don't tell anyone where we're from
We can cut and paste the stars to our hearts
And understand their language
And we won't spit with our mouths
Or draw lines in the dirt with our heels
And every single day we'll just wait
And hope to see the next one
If we go down too easy my dear
We'll still be the heart of envy of all our friends and peers
So I get home to my home
The thoughts are in my head
And my bed is full of things I left
When I left her here
And the light through the blinds
And through the windowpane in the lane
Where the fire is getting cold
For they have burned all of their belongings
And up the stairs there's a pair
Who like to be made sure
That they were everything they are
For they are sadly mistaken
Now I forget how we met
Those days have all passed
Now the cast is filing to the stage
In a rage and taking their places
If we go down too easy my dear
We'll still be the heart of envy of all our peers and friends my dear
To them we'll be has-beens
To them be rouge waves
To them be lost trains
Just posers posing
We'll leat with our eyes
And weep our goodbyes
And if that's what it takes
We'll both drink the Kool-Aid again

Thrown from the heavens like discharged light

Inviting this disaster to the gardens of Eden
Sink these teeth of blasphemy into the skin of faith

Upon a throne of suffering with visions of hateful awakening

Yo, Don P
Why all these fake poeple getting a pass around here?
We ain't letting that happen
*tag* The weight is over
 Ouuuu

Lets get one thing clear
We are not alike, you are not my peer
Why every nigga gettin play, ain't really from round here?
How homie get found here? you ain't never moved a pound here
I really been down here, they knew my name before rap
Fatal the don, I been on, fuck your contract
In a big body, roll, put holes in your compact
In all black, or fatigue for the combat
I heard you a crip, why you rollin with bloods
Asked him why.. all he could reply was BCUZZ!!
Real do real and i see what you duzz
Everybody know you out there gettin pipped for a buzz
 Ouuuu

Oohhhh... he got you after the club
Yo T these kats fake, we gonn jack up um what?
I mean really never head of um, who backin um up??
I hang with millionaires, then im right back in the cut
With a cup.. my dawgs hungry, will kill for a plate'
You ain't never had a dime, had a 9, or ever ate
So if you lookin like dinner, know your fate
Look ma im ballin, i dont even need the weight
Been gettin rap money, make rappers, act funny
I already know you front, thats why you got your back to me
Been turnin down deals, had your label ask for me
You could let um take a cut, i want it all.... Cash Money
 Ouuuu


The weight is over.. but i dont go without
I could flood the block if the rap game a drought
Tell me how you run the town, you only run your mouth
I make one phone call, your album never come out
Uncless you come out, your team rockin a blouse
You ain't doin it right, I gotta clean the house
Clean um out, with killas that you read about
Got um out and put um on a different route
Always kept it real, I couldn't leave um out
No doubt gettin money... but I need more
We ain't goin poor, all is fair in love and war
Got ya girl in my DM, bring her to the top floor
Let her go around.. like we put her on tour
Encore, ya i bet you want more
Condoms and a gun.... got um right in the top drawer
We dont even talk, know exactly what i called her for
Always down to fuck, in her gut, while i call her whore

"As the days go by
I remember we was sitting on the aisle
Wish I could take it back to the days we lost
But it's easier said then done, someone had to pay the cost
I know nothing lasts forever, no nothing at all
Sometimes you don't ever get up after you fall
Every day's a gamble
I know you can't win 'em all
But that don't stop the hurt at all
One time for my fallen soldiers that were lost in war
Two times for my gangstas who ain't here with us no more
Three times for them fathers that ain't tryna do for they kids
Never thought that missing you would ever feel like this
I hope I see you on the other side
So we can kick it like we did before
I hope you leave a little room on the other side
So I know I got somewhere that I can go
I hope I'm not banging at the door saying let me in
And I pray that I'm forgiven for my sins
And I see you on the other side
Hope I see you on the other side
Real niggas don't cry 'til I seen real niggas who died
I ain't gon' lie, I had real tears in these eyes
Made me feel something inside, seem like I'm gon' lose myself
If I knew somebody else, I'm gon' need somebody else
One time for my fallen soldiers that were lost in war
Two times for my gangstas who ain't here with us no more
Three times for them fathers that ain't tryna do for they kids
Never thought that missing you would ever feel like this
I hope I see you on the other side
So we can kick it like we did before
I hope you leave a little room on the other side
So I know I got somewhere that I can go
I hope I'm not banging at the door saying let me in
And I pray that I'm forgiven for my sins
And I see you on the other side
Hope I see you on the other side
Remember all the good times we had
It's so sad 'cause we can't go back
Now all we got are old times, throwbacks
Know you stay forever on my mind, see you on the other side
Remember all the good times we had
It's so sad 'cause we can't go back
Now all we got are old times, throwbacks
Know you stay forever on my mind, see you on the other side

I put a box of tissues by my bed
'cause I knew that I'd be up forever
waiting for...you...
I left the light on in the hall
'cause I knew that you'd be fallin'
when you finally come home
And anybody with a heart
would've been alone
but you brought her
And anybody with a brain
would've left you then
but I stayed...I stayed...
I gathered all the photographs
in the hope of takin' one long
steamy bath alone
All the water on my skin
could not wash away the years of
tryin' to get in
Even though my love life was
fast asleep and my heart was
breakin' to a million pieces, I stayed
I stayed awake, I stayed awake
Even though my love life was
fast asleep and my heart was
breakin' to a million pieces",Folk
"These tire tracks
zigzag your torso like the devil's self portrait
the car accident, the skin graft treatment, the flower baskets, the wincing relatives
You bid her farewell then you got in your car
and that's the last thing that you can recall
and when they pulled you out, you didn't know your name, exploding semi truck blurred your face with flame
You met Jane four years ago today, dancing at some vomit stained frat party
her newspaper gown, her flashing headline brown, her violent gypsy dance, her tired underpants

Jane let you touch her and feel her and she was so free like a pineapple in a tree but
You said it's dangerous to be so intimate, you know it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous
Jane said when she laid on her back the sun hit her body like an ugly landscape but
Some things never get better,
Like used cars and bad livers,
So you traded her in for a better looking brand
One with fake porno tits,
A padlock on her lips
A disposable tan
Biodegradable hands
And back at the hospital you got no visitors at all, but she visits you in your sleep, and that Newspaper gown is always on fire 
She met him a week after you left her
When you tossed out her touch to the garbage collector.
He talked her out of her skirt in his beer-soaked apartment
And then they did all the things
You never said that you wanted.
And the sirens are laughing underneath your skull
And your thoughts are turning dull, callous and cold
Yesterday you gave your burden a name
Yesterday you gave your burden a face
And that burden, looks an awful lot like her

Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that beamer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped

Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears something Titanic
This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it

Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing
Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in

Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
I'm the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for my sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, raw Stacy delight
Can't deny my Jesus piece that's so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A combo she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow

"We, together
Change the world forever
What a cheerful sound
Synchronize me
Supervise me, mother
No more fooling around
Whatever may come
It shall be from the ashes
He shall rise, I know
And though it hurts me
Don't be surprised, dear mother
Longing to see his end
Don't call it
Hopelessly insane
I go and grasp the grail
But in a graceful way
Illegally, my aim
The grail will cross the border now
Don't tell me that you're innocent
Don't tell me it's divinely ordained by the saints
My demons, my saviors
I weep for all of them
Suffered in vain
My wayward son, you might disturb me
Carry the flame
Till dying embers will stop gleaming
There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Do as it's foreseen
Come and meet the king
There's no choice
For the word it must be
Real, my righteous brother
Fear you soon will know
So, on the fourteenth day passover
He took the firstborn sons
Execute him and now act as
Judas, the chosen one
So after all, in vain
I've met him and found the grail
Cause in a skillful way
I'll change to keep alive
Eternal lie, I'll be the one
Key to life, be the eclipse
Voices from the river Styx
Come to be the Nemesis
Kiss of death
Crucifix and the grail
I've traveled far on hidden pathways
The Holy Grail
Who would have thought that I will hold it
The Holy Grail
There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Don't tell me that you're innocent
Don't tell me that there is a chance to be free
The grail's sent, my way ends
I creep along with the shadows
And resurrected
He comes marching in
There he is
Good lord forgive my sins
Once I've crossed the river Styx
At Sheol's gate, I know
Key to the apocalypse
I have sealed it with a kiss
Nothing that I want to do
Hades is calling
Wake the witch, who'll be the brave one?
Don't say what he's like
Full of voices comes the ninth wave
Don't say what it's like
Beyond the door
There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Well it looked so green and fair
When I built my shanty there
Now my Oklahoma home is blown away

Got some chickens and some shoats
Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face
Got a mule to pull the plow
Got an old red muley cow

Why must we fall in love to find out how to cry?
Build up trust, then tear it down, oh tell me why
When it takes so long to make it
And no time at all to break it off
Then you walked away I just stood there numb
I had nothing to say
Into the night you walked away with my life
And feeling almost half my size
I looked up and the heaven''s eyes
Smile was gone we used to see
She knew that you were standing there with me

You both tried night and day from the start
To keep your love from falling apart

1 and 1 is 2, its just as simple as Blue's Clues
The nine will get most of you, turn yourself around
For he who want to run up and earn himself a crown
Meanwhile study something nigga, this Gucci, Parker
From France where the kids sing Frere Jacques
If not there, I'm somewhere mixing vodkas
In a far off land, where they shake maracas and shit
Keep it moving like in KIs of coke
You the 100th motherfucker and I'm ?
Not Tommy Lee, see we never involve the law
If it seems the walls are closing in it's only 'cause they are

That hug the diamonds that kiss for you haters
Rimoldi is so gaudy
But its just so picture-perfect as I lean in that six forty-five CI
I'm on them blades likes T.I.
The niggas hate to measure cause they knee high
Still slanging that P-I, E what I bring by
Me 50 cal, pretty desert up my sleeve, I
Still hugging that corner so tight it can't breath, I
Can't let it go, cause a nigga got to eat, I
Came to conquer the game, the flame and the powder
And the pot, stirred it crazy, I'm a lead-a
Still in the game, tipping the scale like Libra

Put the flame on a nigga, take chains from a nigga

Are faded and gone.
No flowerer of her kindred
No rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes

To pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping
Go sleep thou with them;
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.

When friendships decay
And from loves' shining circle
The gems drop away!

How do you do?
I think you're lookin good, like your style
I want to get down on you
She took me home
She got me stoned
We rocked all night
I said honey now that's what I like
Decision - I don't know what to do
I think that I'm in love with both of you
I know I must decide which one it will be
But I want you both - I want you with me
So come on I want you both with me
I met another her name was Sil
You know that she looked so fine
I saw her walkin' on up ahead
Wow, she blew my mind
I want to hold her tight

"They all reach to touch him
As he walks out on the stage
They came to see the legend
And to hear the legend sing
While the men sit there applauding
Ladies love him with their eyes
And he looks just like a legend should
Up there in all those lights
But they don't know, after the show
How fast the legend fades
How he reaches for the bottle
When guitars are put away
And the photograph of the love he had
Fills his trembling hand
There's a lonely world of difference
Between the legend and the man
He's won all the shiny statues
All the records pressed in gold
But he lost what really matters
What he really wanted most
And tonight in some big city
Lord, he'll drive the crowd insane
They'll feel the pleasure of his songs
But they won't feel his pain
'Cause they don't know after the show
How fast the legend fades
How he reaches for the bottle
When guitars are put away
And the photograph of the love he had
Fills his trembling hand

One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever lasting light,
So alone, so lost inside, to the ending paradise,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.
In the dark December morning light,
Far strong to the burning winds, the fires of Hell will forsake me,
Shattering the chains that ever bind us,
Suffering their pain eternally.
For strong, smash the silence, carry on like before,
Fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away,
Storm with hail fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,
Lost in times and long forgotten, governing miles away.
Tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by,
Still alive we feel the pain tonight,
Stars fall through blackened clouds, and dreams that miss rains,
A twilight star in the thousand lights for me.

And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.
One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever lasting light

And still we save a breath for the world,

The day I opened up
You shut me out for good

So take what you want and leave
You'll never get another part of me
I remember the day that
I thought I would be free
I poured out my soul to you,
Exposed everything,
Next thing I know
My hearts broke
My hand it's much the same
I did my best to drink you away

So take what you want and leave
You'll never get another part of
You are poison on man's lips
Lured in by the curves of your hips
Come here boy, stand by me
Look my way, have another drink
I should have got up
I should have got up and left you
And I will never ever be you're lover again

Cause today's just scares him.
Thinks of yesterday's blues,
Cause today's are just far too grim.

Lying blind without no warning.
Seen him running through the night,
Through the fall lead his enemies inside.
And it grows, on it grows.
And I'm learning how to walk,
Learning how to take my time,
Or the angels take him away and,
Lay his body six feet 'neath clay,
And it grows, on it grows.
And I see him burning to dust,
Seen him falling through the shadows,
Shed a tear and his cheek rusts,
Seen him falling through the shadows,
And it grows, on it grows.
And I'm learning how to walk,
Learning how to turn my back,
Or the angels take him away and,
Lay his body six feet 'neath clay,

If a bitch don't like me
somethin's wrong with the bitch...

Why...oh why...why..you wanna fuck with me now?

Yo Dave, that shit come with the game baby, the money, you know,
thats how this shit works, you know?
they supposed to love me now baby,
I'm hot now baby, I'm doin' it now.
Chorus 
Girl, what makes you wanna fuck with me now?
I've been wantin' to fuck wit' you for quite a while
is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?
Whoa...if money's gonna make me slam these hoes..then alright.
Verse 1:
Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons,
talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope, y
ou got a smile that only a fool would forget
and a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
there I was, kickin' my game
pickin' her brain
buggin' 'cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
she wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we ain't play games
we exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' ""I know that nigga, he rich""
she think I got six whips 'cause me and my Man switch
anyway, her name is CeCe
she said she go to BMCC
push a '98 328 with chrome BB's
she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
she liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me.

Verse 2:
It's hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya
type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya
they into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls
these trick niggas fucked up, they done gave 'em the World
Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?
nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?
platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it
know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends
probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not
long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop
it goes on and on and on and it don't stop.
Chorus
Verse 3:
One thing you can always count on is change
and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
while we on the 900 double R Hondas
watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
all these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
you can find a material Girl
I sip Dom 'till I earl
take 'em two at a time
quick I get in they mind
have 'em thinkin' they mine
bust off then tell 'em ""Bust a Uey, on mo' time""
I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year
got your bitch breakin' her neck to peep this here
c'mon..uh huh...c'mon.

Fuck you bitch! leave me alone, walk on...get the fuck on...

All the things come to an end
Yes that means we'll never love again
The end of our love the end of my dreams
The end of almost everything it seems

On and on and on as if there were no tomorrow
As if the night had come to stay and there would be no dawn

Everything on this earth has stopped
Except these heartaches these teardrops
And this loneliness goes on and on and on

"I lift my mind to the sky,
and I let it take flight.
The wind carries to my ears
precious sounds of life.
Soon I break all ties
which bind me to this earth.
All that surrounds me seems to melt
into blue eternal.
Higher, higher,
far away.
And the glare of this world
is small and humbled.
Now the warmth of the sun
has refreshed my soul.
She takes her leave, and she bows
to the dreams of the night.
This deepest sapphire,
this feast for open ears.
The clouds have drifted away,
and everything becomes so clear.
Higher, higher,
I must go.
And the glare of this world
is small and humbled.
I lift my mind to the sky,
and I let it take flight.
The wind carries to my ears
precious sounds of life.
Soon I break all ties
which bind me to this earth.
All that surrounds me seems to melt
into blue eternal.
And later when
the sun shines down,
deepest sapphire
feast for the ears.
I lift my mind
up to the sky.

From the slow gumming death at the office orifice.
Ambulance why imprisons the sigh of the recent amputee
And dumps her in the xylophone trees.
Ambulance X scours the tanning complex for Repunzels
Rotting in their skin cooking coffins.
Ambulance why drops the body off at the door step.
Ambulance X pulls you out of the party
And rubs your freckles like a DJ to his records
But Ambulance why teaches you the word goodbye
And cuts your hands to show you where you stand,
Under the monolith of what is love and what is scam, what is sun and what is tan.
The Ambulance Angels pull up to your doorstep
The sirens flash emergency,
""You'd better come quick.""
The Ambulance Angels chisel a crack in your mouth,
And then they paint a landscape with your regret and shouts.
Roll tape and decode the moans,
Ventilate the scandal from these locked up mouth holes.
You'll never see your wife
And children again so tell us what it was going Through your head,
When you looked into their eyes
And said ""no thanks i'll take the hooker instead""
You'll never see that office again
so when the nurse amputates both of your thighs
come a little bit closer to the mic
and tell us what you miss more your desk or the hungry sky.
The Ambulance Angels pull up to the graveyard,
and leave you there bubbling broken sonnets and shards.
The Ambulance Angels notify your next of kin
and show them the scrap book of your operation:

All his secret wishes, all his world famous sighs.

"You've got a full time job, with a minimal pay
You do all of the work, but you don't get no say
You never raise your voice, or try to run the show
You always get there first, you're always last to go
You always take your share, no more no less
And when you've had your turn, there's always something left
For whoever's next, behind you in the line
When there's work to do, you always spare some time
you work your hands to the bone, but you don't complain
You never push up front, just for your personal gain
This goes out to all the zeros, to my personal heros
All the losers and zeros, you're my personal heroes,
This goes out to all the zeros
You never do no wrong, you never hurt no one
You always tell yourself, the best is yet to come
No matter how things look, How bad it all may seem
You always stand your ground, and live by your means
you work your hands to the bone, but you don't complain
You never push up front, just for your personal gain

We're all heros, we're all zeros.......

"""Nothing is for certain""
That's what the showman said
First you must open the curtain
And stand 'em on their heads
There can be no inhibitions
No prima donna ways
If you want to pass the audition
And times is tough these days
Remember when Mr. Barnum
Presented Jenny Lind
They named a candy after her
A circus after him
End of my story
The rest is history
She in all of her glory
He lived quietly
He needed her, she needed him
As sure as the skies above
In a way it was for them
A lesson in love, a lesson in love
You look like the moon glow
That follows me home
Always makes me turn around
Won't leave me alone
First to come are the midgets
A monkey and a kid
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers
The ego and the id
Songs of the season
Apples of the sun
There is no rhyme or reason
Just a time for each and every one
Hang on Mr. Barnum
Hang on Jenny Lind
We will meet you in streets of gold
Where eternity begins
We will let it all hangout
Go hand in glove
Life was meant to live and learn
A lesson in love, a lesson in love",Folk

flames roaring over shatter the silence

two soldiers die from opposite sides
under the same sun
sworn to allegiance proudly they march
pawns of the system
spent rounds hit the ground as you fall to your knees

your hopes and dreams are carried away
like many before you

won't upset the system

Can you imagine goin' through life ashamed of who you are?
Hope seems so fuckin' far.
Every TV is tellin' me we don't exist.
Every church is makin' me dismiss faith, faith in what?! Faith in what I'm doin' is sin and that I'm going to hell and that I can't tell anybody or anyone who I really am.

Trapped in closets 'cause comin' out is to scaryyy.

It's the pain, of datin' a girl who's ashamed of me.
Hides it from her family who's embarrassed of me.
Angy! We can't get married, live normally. That her friends are talkin' about gettin' rings and havin' babies.
And it's makin' us crazy thinkin' we have to live this life, so painfully.
Always doubting that it's okay to be in love with eachother, couldn't fathom life without the other.
But the stress of being hated by this ignorance makes us scared to kiss.
We wish that it was different, BUT IT'S NOT.
So we take what we got, we love eachother a lot, but were smart and we recognize this plot. passin' laws that prevent us from adoptin kids.

Reach the mountain top so I can better see
Step back and see the whole mighty picture

When I was a child
Someone was walking through the pillow that night
The snow muted
The pitch of night
A shadow approached across a field in white
It's only me
It's only me
And the sound of my heart it startled me
As I drifted
From the dark room
Face lifted from the paper moon
Reflected in the orbit bath
He manages to say before he starts to laugh
You can't always trust
The darkness and the dust
But me, I'm just a man
It's more than I can understand
It's only me

Falls away
To reveal the perfect day
Where roses bloomed
Out of thin air
And music rose from down the buried stairs
It's only mine
It's only mine
I grew it in the shade
When the sun couldn't shine
And at times I don't know why
The tears come to my eyes
And what if I go blind
As they flow out of my mind
It worries me
It worries me
That there's someone on my mind
Who I don't see
I close my eyes to disappear
Into the fields of stars between my ears
The dark
As they overlap
We follow one another
As we fade to black
It's only night
It's only night
An ultrasound when I was alive
The shadows go spying on the ones in the wild
They dip their arrows
Into the sea
They wash their arms

And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.
Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.",Pop
"Pull the rag off the six-fo'
Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go
The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone
The D's is chrome, the frame is black

Till the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me, go taste my rims
Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass hypnotic down

If you feel the same way
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA

Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back

Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass

Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch

Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
Somebody tell me where the drinks at
Where the bitches at
You fucking on the first night, meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protÃ©gÃ© of the D R E
You take a picture with him, and you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve
Got something in my waist that you can't touch either
That's â my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I'm in the club on some gangsta shit

Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club
Ain't nothing but a g-thing, baby it's a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat

Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back

Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass

Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch

Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath
Niggas thought I wasn't coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo' with the motherfucking top down
I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre
You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion 'till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down

Tell 'em you came with me

In the V.I.P
It's a new day, and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke

Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back

Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass

Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch

Roll up chronic and hash

Think before you play your silly games
Think before you scream at me
Think before you call me out my name

That you do to me
Cause a stone'll happen to you

Think before you cheat on me
Think before you take her home tonight
Think before you say your sorry
Think before it's too late, stop wasting time

What kind of Spirit or Trinity
What kind of God? What kind of friend?
Did God let Jesus die again?

Can't somebody's God fix this?
Can't any body's God fix this?

Breaking me open in my heart

What kind of Spirit or Holy Ghost
What kind of God?
What kind of friend?
Maybe, God let Jesus die
'Cause we wouldn't get it otherwise
In canyons and in purple skies
That's how you get to the big reprise
Not like He's some guy
Sitting up there thinking this is why
But, maybe everything let's everything die

To love one another and be really present

Fifty cents would buy us popcorn for two

Wouldn't wake up 'till noon

Another friend to say goodbye
And another time to sit and cry

You know, he gave my poor heart rest
He was my world, my heart, my dear

Oh, it's many a mile

The only difference is in a name
And the only home I ever known
Was a suitcase and the open road

She took a likin' to me
Said she loved me
But she didn't know the meaning of the word
She imagined love to be grand
Me holdin' her hand and
Whisperin' sweet things and
Cooin' softly like a song bird
Then one mornin' she came to me
With a tear in her eye and a
Sigh on her breath Lord she said
""Hon I'm heavy with child""
I said ""god damn girl can't you see
That I'm breakin'my back
Just tryin' to keep my head above water
And it's turnin' me wild""

My homie used to rap, he was about to get put on
At his funeral, listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming, I hurt for 'em
A cold world that's why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
I'mma need to go back, I gots to get 'em
Back and forth in these streets, that's the rhythm
Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch, cost my man his life, I can't afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his true religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him, his life is over then

Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end

My whole life I had to worry about eatin'
I ain't have time to think about what I believe in

And I don't want my waves following him, the streets swallowing him
And I don't want no hollows in him, his momma said she see his father in him
Hope it's the good things, 'til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates 'cause I know you've forgiven what I've done
I'm your son, do I have the keys to get in?
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom  ooh 
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom  ooh
Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever's on your plate
Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven 'cause I couldn't get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back 'cause these stripes ain't free
We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water
Lean and took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse, they wasn't for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, been phased giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain't from around here you get gunned down here

Didn't wanna be your boyfriend

But then Jamie, I thought she was the one

Then Katie, I couldn't get enough
She was just like pumpkin pie
And then Katie she kinda had a thing with Stacy
And that was pretty fun
But lately I wanna go to sleep with the same girl
The same girl every night
Some girls should come with a warning
And a dose of penicillin first thing in the morning
But last night that never really crossed my mind
Always one girl after the other

I was flirting with your mother

"I don't give a fuck
They done push me to the limit the more I live
I might blow up any minute, did it again
Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga he's jackin
I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watch the hurst past
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snippe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hoes
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I ain't goin' nowhere no how
Better bring your guns pal
Cuz this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with my A-K
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
So step but you better step quick
from the mutha-fuckin' underground
Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a physco-path
The truth didn't last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do yah figure!?
A mutha-fuckin night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I don't give a fuck
Niggas!, isn't just the blacks
also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city
They say niggas like to do niggas,
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge
I had to shoot yah and the pass for the blast take his cash
And that's just his luck
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
Cause a nigga like me
don't really give a fuck
Walked in the store what's everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a mutha fucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business else where
But where?
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than
His pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
while he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as casanova
And count another quick meal
I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
AS strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Usta come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just don't give a fuck
They just don't give a fuck
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San FranCisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the F.B.I

"Man this is god's poetry, vibe and roll with me, rocking all on this beat
I used to complain about not having shoes, until I seen a man with no feet
Now I feel rich
Money don't make me who I am I never looked down on someone that need a lift
Kindness is a gift
Kinda can smell success, I'm just, I'm just trying to get a whiff
You could say that I'm glad that I had me a childhood 
'Cause now I'm living out my dreams
Nowadays kids not even living they life, they just staring in they iPhone screens
By any means necessary
Rhyming all that's left in you
Better love the ones next to you
I see a lot of young niggas looking for a sex symbol
Technology is taking over
Feed off these real vibes as you make it older
Young soldier, we all gotta grow
And when you think that you got life figured all out, you realize how much you don't know
Look, after Moms threw me out on the curb
Back when the vibes was louder than words
Yo, I told myself I was gon' get it and god is my witness
My focus was how to be heard
Now I'm here, I see the smiles and tears
I hope this live for a thousand years 
True leaders create more leaders, so tell them haters they ain't never gonna be allowed in here
'Cause we characterize 
People by actions I see when I stare in your eyes
Forever surprised 
See, everything better whenever I'm high
Break it down
I wanna let out all my frustrations
But I ask myself can I feel this way
Ay, ay, ay, ay 
Can I feel this way?
Is it wrong that I feel this way?
Can I feel this way?
Because
Look, I don't know y'all trying to be
I'm creating my dynasty
Inspire these kids every time I speak 
I guess they believing us
Like Martin when they tried to black out the black folks and white America mistreated us
My momma said ""too bad they needed us""
It's only one race and that's the human race
So that's what I plan to teach my kids
Respond to these fools with silence
As I'm giving y'all the growing process
You can tell me what's next
I ain't heard nothing like it

From living in positive energy without ever having a doubt?
Or praying for my enemies,  by the hate
'Cause I ain't never take the easy way out
S'till I pray
Can I feel this way, Lord tell me can I feel this way
Real man always trying to make a play, just a thought
Got me working at my craft every day

W-w-w-wake up, get right, look in the mirror and I hope you see yourself
I honestly don't want you to be like me
I wanna, inspire you to go and be yourself
We call that love and awareness
The shit that you get for free but don't cherish
Y-you have a beautiful soul, it's no reason to be so embarassed
'Cause we just gon' characterize
These people by actions I see when I stare in your eyes
Forever surprised
See, everything better whenever I'm high

Demonios hambrientos de sangre malvada y cruel

Hombres endiablados condenados por el Juez

Take the michael,
Hear my recital
While I hold the title
Quite vital
We get high on the opposite of Nytol
It was all to stay awake for the longest time
It was long, it was wrong
But it felt so right
See you at the finish line
See you at the finish line
If you got the heart to join us
If we don't kill ourselves we'll be the leaders of a messed-up generation
If we don't kid ourselves will they believe us if we tell them the reasons why
Do we take it too far, take it too far?
Did we chase the rabbit into wonderland?
Lose a hundred grand
Will they understand
It was all to stay awake for the longest
March on, always after us
Lost troops, half the class of us
You might not see the last of us
Stick around yeah like Elastoplast
Not half mast,
Raise the flag, kick the sand
To let them know that we're coming
And we're nasty men
Don't need sleeping beauty
No, it's what you did to me
Come midnight and daybreak
Yes please go find me a name sake
We got faith, but don't need bibles
Take the Michael,
Hear my recital
While I hold the title
Quite vital
We get high on the opposite of Nytol
We just grow, if it's late
Then we'll show, we don't wait
We just grow, if you hate
We don't show, we don't wait
We just grow, if it's late
Then we'll show, we don't wait
We just grow
If we don't
If we don't kill ourselves we'll be the leaders of a messed-up generation
If we don't kid ourselves will they believe us if we tell them the reasons why

Am I the only one that you make feel this way?
Where did you learn from?
Nothin' you were doing can be taught these days

Tell me how you doing it to me, showing off
Let 'em see you show it off, with the whole world going off
I don't think you know you're that fine
Making 'em all beg falling to their knees
You know you're blowing my mind
Make 'em all die fall to their knees
Where that walk come from?
How you do it keep me so mesmerized
You may be that one
With a body like that you would start a riot

Deux jolis yeux qui s'ennuyaient,
Pourtant les hommes j'imagine
A San Cristina leur souriaient
On aurait dit qu'Ã  San Cristina
Sous le ciel rose de juillet,
CachÃ©s dans l'ombre des colines
De San Cristina ils m'attendaient
C'Ã©tait la fin de mes vacances,
Mais quand ils ont croisÃ© les liens
Dans ces yeux lÃ  j'ai vu d'avance
Que le bonheur me disait : viens?
Et le soir mÃªme Ã  San Cristina
On a pu voir sous le ciel bleu,
BercÃ©s par la brise marine
De San Cristina, deux amoureux !

De ne sonner que les mÃ¢tines

En la tenant entre mes bras?

I hear your voice
I feel you whispering
In my ear
I close my eyes

Reflecting upon our desire to dwell and feign
Liberate me
If ever believing in higher ground
To seize the water
We'll master before we drown
Liberate me

Yo no puedo volver a darle un equilibrio a mi vida
Me siento tranquilo con mi pero simplemente...
Calling on me
I hope I will
remember you
And how you pulled me
into the truth
I still hear you
Whispering

With no cussing and shit
I tried

It don't matter 'cause I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas why'all too whack to dance
Why'all need to ease up off that now before why'all splint why'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down you and I niggas don't try niggas
I changed my mind I don't want your bitch

You could keep her
I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for NL

And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper
So pass the reefer
And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches
But if you paid nigga pat your pockets

And for sure
You've got yours
I've got mine's and we're balling
So call up everybody
Let's pitch in on a party for sure
Alright
Somebody play the potato
Let's take a ballad
On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid
'Cause we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again
And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing they banging jacky chicken in they mouth
And time to shine pitching a fit
'Cause somebody rolled her bud in a heeny blunt and won't pass the shit
Who keeps turning the lights on?
Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?
I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted
Five hundred dollars worth of white star
About to hide it
'Cause why'all ain't drinking mine up
You better drink that Anj and Palmason and the rest of that wine up
You party haters need to stop it
I think we really about to pat your pockets

Hey baby
My girlfriend left me today
So which one of you old ragedy ass bitches want to come in here and play?
That's what my homie told and try to cop the Cancun
Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom
And in the kitchen and up in there on the dance floor
By the big screen t.v. where your pants go?
Some of you niggas I swear
I try to throw why'all a ragedy ass party
And why'all don't even care
Cigarette burns in my plush
Empty beer bottles in the brush
And my bitch acting like a lush
Boy what else could go wrong?
Somebody kick the extension cord out
Move!
Why'all gotta be some of the clumsiest muthafuckas
To the sounds, now some
Why'all done fucked up

Pretty boy, my faithless fallen angel
Took me completely in his arms
In his eyes, I saw Eden?s garden
But the serpent lay hidden in his charms
Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair
Til that fateful day when I followed him there
He said, climb, little Sadie higher
Spread them downy wings and fly
You will find your crown of gilded glory next to mine
Climb, little Sadie, climb
Icy winds up on Lookout Mountain
Chilled two bodies to the bone
But for that man, I did gladly lay down my back
Upon a bed of stone

I can't help thinking hard about,
What's really gonna happen,
And what's in store for

And if we're gonna make it work

And see this too the end, see it to the end

It'll take some time to fix it up
But that is something we must do,
With solid hearts and clearer minds,
We'll raise our voice and blast right through.
We'll stop the ones who fuck it up,
And show the world that they can't stop the crew.
The crew is me, the crew is you, yeah we're the crew!
The threat of war ain't over,
And yes I fear it's getting near,

It all may just start.

And watched the sun rise in the dawn
I walked by aside a cold cold river and heard the nightingale song
I once saw the king of a mighty nation the princess and I had a conversation
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
I salied many times in a deep deep ocean watched waters roll on many sands
Spent a night just a looking at a high high heaven and marvel that God's mighty hand
I tremble like a baby when I see a snowfall
Or standing in the forrest where the trees're so tall
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
Through the small port window of a big main whiner I watched the cities rush by
And the gay shining wings of a great steel eagle were just aburn in the sky
Well I walked by myself in the low low valley that every man could do

Nobody else could miss her, not half as much as me
She cried, so when I left her it'd like to broke my heart

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds; they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about, Clementine, and sing of Rosalee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me
Where the Rio Grande is flowing and the skies are bright
She walks along the river in the quiet summer night
I know that she remembers when we parted long ago
I promised that I'll return and not to leave her so
She's the sweetest little rosebud
Now I'm going back to find her, for my heart is full of vow
We'll do the things together we did so long ago
We'll play the banjo gaily; she'll love me like before
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine for ever more

Plus with the Zapp, super-slumping

Bumping, hella drunken
But we always into something
>From doing doughnuts, making hoes go nuts
Our names should be Dunkin

It ain't no function
We chose today to holla and spread love, folks
We talk to each other like we was brothers
We have more pull than tugboats

But like them cutthroats
That cash flows up and down like a teeter-totter
Instead of their doggs
They check for their Lexus and their Movados

I don't know why cause
Who they checking for ain't even ridahs
We keep our doggs beside us
That's why we the survivors

BOTTLES UP!

Toss up your Hennessy, Mo'-mo' and Alize
Ain't no player hating this way
It's a holla holiday

Move on, move, move on


So go on, na!
Doggonit, everybody get your love on
Everybody be getting they hug on
Forgetting to put they doggs on

Ladi-dadi, nothing but a party
Toast this up, let's make it happen
Holla if you need me, pass me the beadie
We through rapping
Holla at me, holla at your doggs
Take me high, lace me
Make love to my intellect
Sprinkle me, mayne, sprinkle me
Cause the people over the stairs
They ain't sweating me

"Runnin' through this business of life
Raisin' sand if I'm needed to
Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right
Then daddy's hand helps to see me through
Sweet as sugar, love won't wash away
Rain or shine, it's always here to stay
All these years you and I spent together
All these winters, couldn't stand the weather
Like a train that stops at every station,
We all deal with trials and tribulations
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years
Entangled in yellow and cries all his tears
Changes come before we can go
Learn to see them before we're too old
Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy

They say Alton had a gun, we ain't see it in his hands though

All these murders on the news
Every week it's another one, DJ Khaled
How we gon' respect the badge if you don't protect and serve?
They say life ain't a movie but it's feelin' like The Purge
And this rag in my pocket match the blood in the curb
Hear the shots in the hood but can they feel it in the 'burbs?
Turn on the news, get seduced by the words
And the noose on the black man's neck sounds absurd
Summer 16 look like more than a Drake song
And that's just this year, y'all forgot about Trayvon?

Trump and Hillary both cons
Backstab us like the bullets in the back of LaQuan
This ain't The Game, I come to you as Jayceon
With both of my hands up, don't shoot on my palms
Tamir Rice was just a kid and unarmed
Them cops was Cleveland fans, you just killed the next Lebron
We just need a resolution
When did being detained become a fuckin' execution?
Turn on the news, my stomach turnin' to knots
As the world keep turnin', I'm about to turn into Pac
I'm so determined, I promise to sing a sermon
Every night a mother dreads like Busta in Higher Learnin'
Candles burnin' so we marchin' up the blocks
Moment of silence every time a body drops
When the killin' gon' stop?
If they stop killin' us will we stop killin' cops?

You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me, can you stand up?
Knowin' everybody can't stand us?
Don't they know that hate is a cancer?
Ask around, nobody got the answers
Now tell me, can you stand up?
Knowin' everybody can't stand us?
Didn't know we was livin' in Orlando
People dyin' with their hands up
Now I hope the whole world

"Many months have come and gone since I wandered from my home
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born
Though a page of life has turned then a lesson I have learned
Well I feel like in those hills I still belong
Way down yonder in the Indian nation ride my pony on reservation
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation a cowboy's life is my occupation
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born

But as I sit here today many miles I am away
From the place I rode my pony through the drove
Where the oak and black jack trees kiss the playful prairie breeze

Outside the reindeer flying
So I just watch them disappear

Around the world
But what do you get up to
With all those other girls?
Tell them you'll give them
Anything they wish
And then you move on
To someone else's list

The one that you took north
And now I'm stuck here on my own
Don't call me Christmas, I don't love you anymore

and our ships all gliding Gently through the foam

there'll be singing in the town
when the boys of killybegs come rollin home

and you cast your nets as rain begins to fall
and the clouds are riding high and the wind will soon blow by
and today you'll amybe get your bumper haul

Well the weather's very rough and the work gets plenty touth
and the ropes will raise the welts upon your hands

And filled it with some dirt, planted a chrysanthemum
And you should've seen how it turned my mood to yellow
It turned my mood to yellow in a day
I read about a boy who suffered depression
His parents hung a mirror inside his bedroom
And they made him smile at it three times a day
'Til it took his depression away
And it goes to show that there's a natural way
Of healing what we're feeling inside
It goes to show that before we prescribe
We should first try a simple smile
So I drive out to the middle of nowhere
And I turn little as I stare up at the stars in the sky
And these heavens erase any worries I face
If I look up once in a while
And it goes to show that there's a natural way
Of healing what we're feeling inside

wishing I could have the moment to grab the trophy and glass of champagne
my locker rooms a cold place, LA got no gates
you mighta seen this man cry, that was just my old face
my soul waits redemption and intervention from a higher dimension
inspire mission, no more hoping or wishing, conditions'll change

In the time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shore
On the blackest plains in Hell's domain
We watch them as they go
Through the fire and pain and once again we know!
So now we're flying we're free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness
Our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown
Far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls!
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on!
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the midmorning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny is time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight!
And on the wings of a dream
So far beyond reality
All alone in desperation
Now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find
Lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on!
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on!
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard, now can we understand
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man!

Get it runnin' drag me in and put the spittle on my chin

Has broken my trusting heart in two

You had me fooled for a while cause I thought that you meant it

For money had to get it cause a nigga was struggling

"Well how do you do, young Willy McBride,
Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside,
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun,
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.
I see by your gravestone you were only 19,
You joined the great fallin' in 1916.
Well I hope you died quick, and I hope you died clean.
Willy McBride, was it slow and obscene?

Did they beat the drums slowly,
Did they play the fife lowly?
Did they sound a death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?
Did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind,
In some faithful heart, is your memory in shrine?
And though you died back in 1916,
In that faithful heart, you're forever 19.
Or are you a stranger without even a name,
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane.
In an old photograph, torn and battered and stained,
And faded to yellow in a brown yellow frame.

Now Willy McBride, I can't help wondering why
Do those who lie here know why they died.
Did they really believe when they answered the cause,
Did they really believe that this war would end wars?
But the sorrow, the sufferin', the glory, the pain
The killing and dying were all done in vain.
But, Willy McBride, it all happened again, and again, and again, and again, and again.

Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?",Pop

Beneath the TV was a secret door
There was a ladder down to a tunnel
And I was walking underneath my floor
I walked for miles in the darkness
Until I popped up in my local gym
The lights were bright for working out
And then I saw you, you were talking to him
But he was talking to me
While he was looking at you
And he was mouthing his words

Just not the kind you think
And though my scenes deliver
Now my ship is beginning to sink
I put my love into every part
And have you ever seen
The arrows from my quiver
Piercing the golden queen?
Back in the tunnel I heard the voices
Coming down from yesterday
I drank my bottle of sugar water
And headed out through the city's decay
Fell through a vent in a warehouse
Landed on a Van Nuys sound stage
You helped me up, you in your glasses
A cold, naked California sage
And though I knew it was you
It was so hard to believe
The written words that you spoke
Were true
I'm just a kind of a cinema star
Just not the kind you think
And though my scenes deliver
Now my ship is beginning to sink
I put my love into every part

My body starts to shiver
When I fill up your TV screen?

"Like mighty ships that sail the Atlantic foam
The Skellig Isles parade the Kerry Coast
It's a strange place with the needle's eye
Where shipwrecks lie
Where the king of the world rested for a while
And a place for the pilgrim, a sanctuary of time
Fourteen steps to nowhere, out of solid stone
Don't lead us to the Heavens or lead us to the sea
The Vikings came to plunder and destroy
But to this day the holy relics stand
In a blind mans cove, where the wailing woman sigh
And the seagulls cry
Where the king of the world rested for a while
And a place for the pilgrim, a sanctuary of time
Fourteen steps to nowhere, out of solid stone
Don't lead us to the Heavens or lead us to the sea
A journey to these islands, so rare
The sound of screaming souls that fill the air
A thousand wings, against the sky
And gray seals disguised
Where the king of the world rested for a while
And a place for the pilgrim, a sanctuary of time
Fourteen steps to nowhere, out of solid stone
Don't lead us to the Heavens or lead us to the sea",Folk

Leave behind a man in pain and sorrow
Silly me, who thought we'd be together
But tonight we'll say goodbye forever
Only for the night
Take me to the moonlit sky
Only for the night.
Even though I do respect your wishes
All we had in a whiff has turned to ashes
You and I were perfect for each other
Can't you see, you and I must be together.. but!
Only for the night
Take me to the moonlit sky

"When you a G, niggaz wanna be like you
Because a G has images what they look up to
But some don't make it, so they takin' the funk
They get hot and they be poppin' that gangsta junk
But that ain't G, that ain't even close, nah that ain't shit
It ain't about who can bang or slang the most 'caine
And ki's or O's, sport new clothes
Or about who can fuck the most hoes
'Cause it's a mind state, it's playin' it's manipulatin'
It's winnin' from the freakin' and maneuverin' and then captivatin'
Livin' the life that make the bitches wanna fiend and dream
And all the jealous niggaz mean and scheme
And weak minor suckaz they wanna show they ass
But a nigga like Quik'll check 'em real fast
They don't know the real and so they quick to assume
That's why they shut up when I enter the room 'cause I'm a G
Playin' tough
But them niggaz ain't really rough
Creampuffs is a better word than tough
When you a G, attention is yours
When you demonstrate power
And game the untrues imitate
They get frustrated, they sock girls and slam doors
But when you're a G you just check yours
Takin' up the slack, all the way around
And then my back got yours, then we ain't goin' down
Like Playa Hamm said, it's the thing that I pray for
And play for, that I slay for
'Cause I'm the G when it comes to a funky track
I'm the G when it comes to the whole sack
I'm the G when it comes to decision makin'
I'm the G that got all these niggaz blinkin'
I'm the G that's young and intimidatin'
I'm the G never sprung got the bitches waitin'
I'm the G suckaz fear because I'm strong
And I'm the G, never standin' alone
Fadin' 'em, left to right, front back to center
I'm a natural born winner
I got connects on a quest to be true
So I won't teach you what I know
I'ma teach you what you know, yo
My game is tight so if you're lookin' and listenin' and learnin'
Apply it to yours and you'll earn respect in abundance
And you can never be checked see
When you're a motherfuckin' G
y'all better get hip
And come off this trip
Wit'cho  killin' asses
The G-ness, when you a G it's the description
The suckaz are fearin' it
'Cause in the mack they keep on hearin' it
They wish they could neglect it
But they can't so they disrespect it
And when they run up, yeah they get chin checked
When you a G, backs to backs never duckin'
Suckaz freakin' yo' bitches though, dismissin' the hoes
Before a bigga nigga, when you a G you're the teacher
Any other way that I coulda come just might not reach ya
The G-ness, such as my gangsta mentality
The G-ness, such is the greatness of my pals and me
Destiny's testin', trueness of character
Since I'm a G, fuck with my brothers that fucks with me
Come to the Penthouse if you want if you aren't true
And journey through the mind of a G since he ain't you
It ain't just the mack or the sack or the strong back
It ain't just the plain simple fact we got all that
It ain't just the dead weight, that we droppin' daily
Crews I don't forget, 'cause my memory don't fail me
Those that know, know I know that they do
Those who are wondering?

I only owe to P.P.C. a chosen few
I got players all around me, doin' what they want to
The rise of the wise got suckaz droppin' like flies
When you a G nigga, peepin' the prize from these eyes
Low down, niggaz, what?
Low down, niggaz, what?
Low down, niggaz, what?
Niggaz, what?

"A box full of groceries
Rotten clothes, she's torn her knees
In the main street chill
She sleeps at night in broke-down cars
Squirts the dreams into her arms
She says, ""Junkie-man, have your fill.""
Well, she had friends that went abroad and do not write
She says the hardest ones are those who stay behind
CHORUS:
In the valley of the dead cars
they would end it all if they could start
They sent out their kids to wander the world
Now they can rest at last
You're out scootin' by the graveyard
and you're looking for a brave heart
Could've been your lover but you said you never gave
You have to be home early
or you'll get smacked 'round the head till bedtime
Now you hike the roads on your half-shod feet
You hump the devil, you hump the police
Criss-cross Harlem playing hide-and-seek with death
And now she lurches off as haughty as a queen
to take the waters in old Skibbereen--CHORUS
So I took her back with me to my own true place
which was a mildewed and disintegrating cottage
overlooking a disused waterfall
and we lay there in silence, fruitless silence
until just before dawn when she rolled over onto me
They come withal in their Japanese cars
They know where the good meal bargains are
and they spy by the side of the road
in the twilight, rain and storm
She juts her thumb in futile haste
Contempt to her is sweet to taste
The nuns told her, ""Do not waste sensation.""
When the towns are all just smoking empty shells
she will still be here doing what she does well
In the valley of the dead cars
at the mouth of a flooded mine
I will embrace you hard
and we'll wait for the sun to shine
in the valley of the dead cars
The valley of the dead cars",Rock

Get hit with a K round, ya ass ain't gon' make it

That house party off the hook, until the shots go off
Well that's what you get for stuntin' on my block show off
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin'
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin'
Shorty down there, on the Queens track takin' a whippin'
Shit, bitch get out a pocket, she needs some discipline
Peep the fiends, shootin' diesel in his arm in the alley
Look at the chrome spinners spinnin' on that black DeNali

Who shall we praise now

Woman don't pay no mind
Forgotten like a hotel Bible
Phone keeps ringing and I'm trying to keep my mind off it
And if you walk by my window
I'll open the blinds to watch you
Walk by like you didn't know

Heard you're doing fine on the outside
Smelling like a fresh picked rose
Me, I'm still mothballs and lost minds
Down on the pavement praying, trying to make some sense of it

Or would you walk by never knowing
That I'm cigarette smoke floating in the glow of the TV
What would you expect from me?
I'm right back where I started
I never lost that first touch dreaming
Of that one first feeling that convinced me you were leaving
And how would you expect to breathe
With all of this around you?
Now I'm in this old empty room
Tracing back my steps to the place where I found you
Ring twice never come in so
People don't change like time
I'm sticky like the front door's deadbolt, the side door exit,
Wish I could've learned to let go
And if I came knocking on Sunday
Would you wear your white dress for me?
Or would you watch love through the peephole,
Talk through the chain blindfolded so that you never see me
I heard you like picking at wounds girl
Open up and let this one bleed
I never thought that you'd be the scalpel
To open up my doubtful and leave me in the backseat
And if I pull up from the attic
Would you wipe the dust off your dreams?
Or would you buy back what you gave up,
Open up fact to your nature and admit you were human
What would you expect from me?
I'm right back where I started
I never lost that first touch dreaming
Of that one first feeling that convinced me you were leaving

Remembering the image I was trying to project to you
Cast an illusion, think I'm losing my head

Be what you want, I can be what you want
Be what you want, I can be what you want

I'm drowning in the pit of my stomach

While you're busy diving down I find I feel fine
Feel a little out of my mind
Oh I'm stuck, I've said too much
I'm going, much
I can check and wait
I'm waiting for some kind of response from you
Let me know
I haven't opened up
The floodgates again, to another man
Who controls the pain and never says anything
Anything
Anything
I don't owe you much
But I miss you such
I'm missing you

Lose my eyes in the bathroom,

Bite my lip in the car, midnight ringing,

Search for the lighter in my pocket,

And I only eat fruit out of tins.

When I close my eyes.
I've got nothing to be afraid of,
So I'm afraid of nothing.

Because I think the sky is gonna fall in.

Mess so soon in my life?

Was comfortable and kind.

"Let's begin at the beginning:
We're lovers and we're losers,
We're heroes and we're pioneers,
And we're beggars and we're choosers.
We're skirting round the edges
Of the ideal demographic.
We're almost on the guestlist,
But we're always stuck in traffic.
We've watched our close associates
Up and play their parts;
They're chatting up the it girls,
And they're tearing up the charts,
While we were paying with coppers
To get our round in at the bar.
We're the see-Team, we're the almost famous
Old friends of the stars.
Justin is the last
Of the great romantic poets,
And he's the only one among us
Who is ever going to make it.
We planned a revolution
From a cheap Southampton bistro.
I don't remember details
But there were English boys with banjos.
Jay is our St George, and he's standing on a wooden chair,
And he sings songs and he slays dragons, and he's losing all his hair.
Adam is the resurrected spirit of Gram Parsons, In plaid instead of rhinestone and living in South London.
And no one's really clear about Tommy's job description,
But it's pretty clear he's vital to the whole damn operation.
Dave Danger smiles at strangers, Tre's the safest girl I know,
Zo and Harps will skamper up to victory in the city we call home.
We won't change our ways, we will proud remain when the glory fades.
I am sick and tired of people
Who are living on the be-list.
They're waiting to be famous
And they're wondering why they do this.
And I know I'm not the one who is habitually optimistic,
But I'm the one who's got the microphone here so just remember this:
Life is about love, last minutes and lost evenings,
About fire in our bellies and furtive little feelings,
And the aching amplitudes that set our needles all a-flickering,
And help us with remembering that the only thing that's left to do is live.
After all the loving and the losing,
For the heroes and the pioneers,
The only thing that's left to do
Is get another round in at the bar.",Indie

"You speak of love
But you ain't no lover
You were a friend
More like a brother
As the miles pass beneath me
The sounds made so
Sweetly came to an end
And no man can deny her
But now you're a liar
And you've no room left to defend
When I left I should have known better
Of the kind of man that you are
You'd have to get her
And I know you got a lot of pain
That's born inside you
But instead of growing stronger
You let it divide you, oh
How could you be so careless
How could you be so careless
And the waves that are crashing
True lives of passion
Washing on your shore
Yes sir, life has been costing
A true love's been lost
And I can't get back anymore
And I'm sure
That we both still both love her
And it's a shame we both lost her
And in time lost each other
But a trust has been broken
And words have been spoken
But you can mend
And no man can deny her
And as you laid beside her
I hope it felt good my friend
How could you be so careless
How could you be so careless",Folk

A soothing tune
To wake the dead and let life back in...aahhh

Death before dishonor
Ride with weap' up, cause niggaz tryin to dent my armor
Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
Cause I play for the Bucks, and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back, like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

Steppin out of Chevies with heat that's heavy - that's president
Bullets flyin for them dead guys - that's president
Led meltin inside your wig - that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin - it's all president

Aiyyo I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block
High-tech collaborations with the Gamblaz and Blacksox
Drillin 'em killin 'em if we ain't feelin 'em nigga
If Sticky Fingaz need some music straight stealin it nigga
Shinin, in big trucks, big will in it nigga we climbin
To the top and we sealin it nigga
So back the fuck up, my niggaz act the fuck up
So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the fuck up
Jacked the fuck up, beat up bad and clapped the fuck up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line, and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin
Roll in 600's, Beemers and 'llacs
We a team of cats, with the pens and gats
That fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached
We fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached


It's Telly and young Game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin
Lle or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop

I'll stay in the spot, wearin a crop and coppin ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth

And you don't want it when the stainless out, what the game about
The bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggaz can't stop us dawg

So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards and y'all really the niggaz that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack

For a girl just like you
When I saw you, I could tell then
All my dreams had come true
You came a-cruisin' into my life
I was ready for a change
I knew you were a hot girl
So I asked your name
You said it don't matter
Take me with you tonight
We'll hit the town and we'll party
Make sure I'm home before light
So we went cruisin' together
We had one hell of a time
That lady and I tore up the town
You know she blew my mind
We hit all the night spots
You know the music was intense
Lights reflected in her eyes
In the room the smoke was dense
I took her back to my place
You know she felt just fine
I started coming on to her
In seconds she was mine
Morning sun shone in her hair
You know she sure looked wild
I could really tell then
She was a Hot Child",Metal

You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry

Trying to find a way to write my confession down
Seems every line I writes amiss
At least this I'll admit
I never hear that perfect sound

Boy you can't pretend, You've got to be honest now
My verdict has come in
It says I'm guilty for my sins this time
I thought I could escape
But then I finally felt the weight
Of my crimes
This is passion, it's not love
Infatuation never ends up right
At least I won't be alone tonight
'Cause I don't want to be alone tonight

They had convincing evidence
It seems I've been deceived
So now I stand alone and wait for the first stone
To be cast upon me

"City lights burning so brightly, they beckon me home
The tales of the past, lie under the surfaces cold
They taunt me with memories beyond the Zanzibar high
Drown me in sorrows that led me so close I could die
Take me inside
I'll step off the ride
Lead me to home
To things I have known
And I'm fading
Watching that resevoir fading
Leaving that resevoir high
Leaving that resevoir dry
These city streets change, but their essence is still just the same
And Zanzibar stands like a vision of torment, now tame
The victims' are healed, and the scars have all recently dried
The blood now flows freely within, and has nothing to hide",Indie

Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
Well, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way
Well, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
I've been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Well, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

Got us some P, runnin' the D's so we gon' smoke this weekend

Bullets commense to skeetin'

Why we shouldn't slang crack and cocaine, nigga my pockets weak and
So I'ma bring in everythang, then my G's ain't eatin'
So the result is layin' you down with them Tec-9 bullets skeetin'
That's all we know so that's how we go grab the ski mask for disguisin'
Can't let him see me cause he gon' know me and it'll be too surprisin'
Fuck this nigga cause I'm ridin'
Tryin' to come up so quickly
No time to stall, lickin' 'em all, got a whole team that's strictly
Ready to ball, stand up tall and they all move so swiftly
Them niggaz ain't scared, they do it for bread
See they gon' come go with me
Bustin' up heads and lettin' loose lead
And what do yo rhyme even matter
After you licked you ain't worth shit we get what we got and we scatter
Back to the crib, divide this here, my pockets is gettin' fatter
Yours getting flatter
When you heard the glass shatter
That means me and my niggaz done gathered
Now you bout to feel the wrath of
Somethin' that you wished you hadn't of
And all I can say is back up because I'm bout to act up
I get the stash from the back from the move
I got a good alibi we could use
We took the dead bodies off in the pool
And put the gloves that we used in the stool
Shit, you gon' have to flush that too
Make sure that you see what you do
Cause if the PIG find out then we through
Then it's off to the County for a few
But that's not how the story is told
Shit, one of us gon' have to go
Cause if them PIG's find out that we stole
We gon' have to bust back at them hoes
So get yo glock ready to reload
Haul ass real fast not slow
Cause on the block is 3rd patrol and they'll beat ya till yo body swole
We need to find somewhere to hide this dough
Shit, what about behind the school
We can come get it later on man just wait for the spot to cool
Got back get the money any way

Comin' from Texas through New Orleans it gets thin and I'm lickin'
Mack 'em and leave, they gotta eat, either it's grindin' or pimpin'
Never get caught slippin'
Need a Cadillac to dip in
Do you niggaz wanna pitch in on a gallon of beer or hard gin
Getting drunk before we start lickin'
I know a nigga we can hit for 10 10 ki's in his grandma den
The back door finna get kicked in
It's another way we can get in
Cut the roof cause it's made out of tin
4 niggaz jumpin' out the shit then
2 niggaz in the car waitin'
Pitch black so we can't see in
Get off my hip nigga stop pushin'
We get caught, we goin' straight to the Pen
One fluke, then we all turned in
Getting life for this Devilish sin
Move slow nigga so we can hear 'em
Where the flashlight so we can see 'em
If they woke then we gon' have to kill 'em
That ain't the reason my folks came here
The old lady came out on the porch
Took her in the house, sit on the flo'
Man, what you came out here fo'
Now I'm gon' have to tie you with rope
We hit the safe then we up out the do'
We done got what we came here fo'
Crank up the car, move nigga, let's go

Move slow, cut the clutch, let's roll
I grab the dough then I hit the back road
I was high but now it's low man somethin' told me to kill that hoe
Runnin' through the woods, my feet got so'
Too damn dark, don't know where to go
Smelled barbecue by Cassy's store
Hit the train track by Smiley Co.
Tryin' to get to my grandma's house
Way on ? Street, man that's out
? think we look suspicious, man we need to spray it out
Me and T runnin' side by side
Me and he, both of us so tired
Fly wide open through Cedar Park tryin' to see if we can find us a ride
Ain't nobody standin' outside
Whole damn neighborhood too quiet
See the police so we still tryin' to hide
Cross Mobley Highway when they ride by
I need somethin' I can try
I see a nigga right now
Standin' up at Domino's waitin' for his food outside

"As I went out walking through Austin's fair city
Through Austin's fair city one morning in May
Was there I spoke to a handsome cowboy
All wrapped in white linen and cold as the clay
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did speak as I boldly stepped by
Come sit done beside me and hear my sad fortune
For I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die
Was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Was once in the saddle I used to ride on
But then turned to drink and then to card playing
Was shot by a gambler and now I must die
Oh Beat the drum slowly, oh play the fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the graveyard and throw the sod o'er me
For I'm just a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong
Go break the news gently to my gray haired mother
Whisper it softly to my sister so dear
But there is yet one far dearer than mother
Who'd fairly weep if she knew I were here
Come gather round me that set of jolly cowboys
To listen to me softly as I live my sad fate
And each of you ride and take warning
And quit the wild roving before it's too late
Six jolly cowboys to balance my coffin
Six pretty girls Lord to sing me a song
Take me to the graveyard and throw the sod o'er me
For I'm just a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Play the dead march as you carry me along

"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",R&B
"Abused, confused
Fought the blues, no shoes
Still I walk
No place, no face
Broken grin, hollow within
Still I walk
Abandoned my friend
Lost hold pot of gold
Left out cold
Compromise to mend
My demise, my end
Despised again
Standing on the edge of time
Looking down I realize
I am here one final footstep forward
Again seemed right
Follow the light it dimmed
No surprise
Somehow tricked perfect fit
Alibi, two-faced lie
No surprise
By the heels
Suddenly I'm pinned
Forced to kneel choked to heal
Failure failed
This rhyme picked my mind
Out of time
Standing on the edge of time
Looking down I realize
I am here one final footstep forward
End of my speech now is clear
What it is I'm doing here
I am here one final footstep forward
Abused, confused
Fought the blues, no shoes
Still I walk
No place, no face
Broken grin, hollow within
Still I walk
Abandoned my friend
Lost hold pot of gold
Left out cold
Detached, fucking wacked
Needle in, story ends
All depends
Standing on the edge of time
Looking down I realize
I am here one final footstep forward
End of my speech now is clear
What it is I'm doing here
Now I'm here one final footstep forward
Standing on the edge of time
Looking down I realize
I am here one final footstep forward
Standing on the edge of time

Get up and wash my ass, and dash, she was just another one night stand for big dick daddy 'case you heard!
Remember when you're all alone,
my cellular phone,
was turned off.
Smokin' burners with my dog, and it's all good, baby.
Everyone who steal the flow,
all y'all some hoes.
Shermed out, let's make some mo' money.
I'm kinda hungry, it's all good. Haters
I don't wanna rock 'em if they study another Bone role.
Will they do the run and when they're comin' when I'm rollin' in my hummer.
A son of a bitch, I got 'em cuffed. Tough in the summer.
Love a thug Nigga from the pinnacle,
I felt like losin' my mind.
There was some other kind.
Really wanna smoke the weed after you swallow me. And try not to follow me blind, find me 69. Real lit,
smokin' the finest vintage wine, talkin' bout time with me
and you wanna to be something more than just a dime to me.
fine with me
  
Get up and wash my ass, and dash, she was just another one night stand for big dick daddy 'case you heard!
'Cause she was just another one night stand, 
'cause she was just another one. 
Get up and wash my ass, and dash, she was just another one night stand for big dick daddy 'case you heard!  Now a bitch can cut me, fuck my homies, be a dyke and spike my Hennessy. Have babies by one of my enemies then, then come and pretend she wanna befriend.
They probably wanna send me to the edge of the cliff,
inherit all of my chips and then go spend it with another nigga. Rubbin' my shit, and lickin' my lick,
nobody does it better than the Rip!
That's the shit, welcome the widow keeping the pistol gripped
under my pillow. Well, when you peep out the window, it's so cold. Get in 'fore the wind blow.
No hoes allowed,-lowed,-lowed.
Get in 'fore the wind blow.
No hoes allowed, no hoes allowed, no hoes allowed.
Now that bitch can cut and fuck my homies, be a dyke and spike my Hennessy. Have babies by one of my enemies then, then, then.
Man, the chicks can cut me. Fuck my homies. Be a dyke and spike my Hennessy. Have babies by one of my enemies then, then, then, then...
 'Cause she was just another one night stand,  'cause she was just another one.  
Get up and wash my ass, and dash, she was just another one night stand for big dick daddy 'case you heard! Get up and wash my ass, and dash, she was just another one night stand for big dick daddy 'case you heard! 
'Cause she was just another one night stand,  'cause she was just another one.
I woke up early in the mornin' with my concubine yawnin'.
Smellin' like last night's Henn'.
'Til the crack of dawn, we get it on.
Then again, nigga reel it down from me
just 'cause we're T-H-U-Gs.
But the money was abundant,
start up my family tree.
Eager to move, we leavin' we got in in Cleveland that same week
or sell speakers, bid for insurance.
And that ass won't free my people with warrants.
Over there, come call us.
All this over a hoe.
My homeboy has no dough and wants to force it,
let me know. What a crazy ass life.
Play me right, don't play me twice.
Damn, I'm a grown man, gettin' in big fights.
It'd be nice to settle down.
Yeah right, yeah right, yeah right.
Yeah right, yeah right, yeah right.
Man, a bitch can cut me. Fuck my homies, homies, homies, homies.  And be a dyke and spike my Hennessey, then, then, then 
Have babies by one of my enemies, have babies by one of my enemies. 
Hung jury 'cause the police, they can never hold me. 
Eventually you're gonna remember me! 
Get up and wash my ass, and dash, she was just another one night stand for big dick daddy 'case you heard!

I can't understand why them other girls mad at me
Take a look around me, nobody's there to see

Don't frown baby, I know you're a fan of me

Want me to talk a flick like they're paparazzi

Setting your night gear and after that follow me
Stay by the switch I'mma beat your high-nee
I see you over there with your man eyeing me
You can understand why you man wanna handle me
Take a look at me and look at you, you's a casualty

So delicate it shatters round my feet,
And my hands they bleed,
A stain I'll always remember,
A stain that stays with me,
But this changes you,
Its harder now we're breaking,
And I should know its never right for me to say,
That I wanted this,
I know I cant but I can still recall,
I gave it all,
Given up on luck my heads above the dust,
This love you broke,
Come closer darling don't forget to fake,
A smile you had,
You tried so hard to fool yourself instead,
You gave it all,
Given up on luck your heads above the dust,
You gave it all,
I waited by the other side my friend,
I've waited by the other side my friend,
You'll find it funny when you're looking back some day.

"A beautiful transformation
Not enough
Woe oh

Let's go
The older I get
The more I get feelings I can't explain
Can't explain
Mostly in the city of the 99% I did not say
I've suddenly evolved
From nothing at all
To somewhat ladylike
My clothes began to fit
And jeans they hug my hips
To catch the young boys eyes

I feel suppression
Many questions
Still I'm guessin'
The pressure's on

Like a butterfly
Changin' into my old skin
Where the tears I cry
Got a lighter side to it
It's a beautiful transformation
It's gettin' harder to reject
Opportunities
I meant to take it further now
I'm feelin' wonderful sensations
It's my body's revelation
It's another world

I can't keep hold of what's inside anymore
It's never in the day
But always late at night
That these feelings occur
That these feelings occur

I feel suppression

Still I'm guessin'
The pressure's on

Like a butterfly
Changin' into my old skin
Where the tears I cry
Got a lighter side to it

Knowin' that I control what I got
Is priceless
Every little part that I have of me
Is precious

Sonic boom to the head of a dread cause he's tread
Upon the Flatline  niggas so now he's dead
Straight out the door, dirty dungeon graveyard
I broadcast and watch Sport Center, Ahmad Rashad
Tic tac toe we smack in theAnnotate back, oh shit
I seem to catch a vic' if a nigga think he slick
I eat a rapper appetizer
Shady like a visor
Punch you in your mouth with my ring the high riser
Kitty cat kitty cat there's a mouse for you to house
But the kitty cat was dead when the dog bit off his head
On the contrary, it's legendary
So I bury
Your punk pussy ass in the pet cemetery
When it's a hit
I'm bringing the Tec-9 mad quick
Flipping the script and ripping your shit up so never slip
Jesus Christ, should think twice before the crucifix
Dip dip diver I'm coming liver than the full clip
Dig up the grave violate your resting place
Rest in peace, pieces, believe that I'ma chase
A nigga through the graveyard, the 100 yard dash
Passionately stash your cash you're out of gas
Don't try to flinch I got the itchy trigger finger
Ringing the neck and bringing the thing a ling a ling and run your check nigga
Open up a womb from a looney tune soon
All of the goons  bust 'em down sonic boom

BOOM to the head, you're dead now it's sonic 
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BAM!

Torture with a grip made out of tombstones
With a Flatline  broken bone and broken dome
I'm a rebel so I catch up with the devil
Put my status on his level with the treble, you're a pebble
The ink pen is sinking, the motherfucking king pin
It's the Gravedigger so I doubt when I'm creeping
Hit you when you're sleeping, I'll lug you down like a log to the morgue
Get you  put one in the spinal cord
I'm shooting , I'm shooting  a motherfuck
I buck like a truck
One, two press your luck
Three crazy motherfuckers, insane with mental problems
In my dreams, I'm busting Glocks down to goblins
And monsters, under my bed go get the sledge
Hammer, mack a framalama, mad niggas dead
So let's play freeze tag upon the burial ground
Stop 
Everybody, what's that sound?
One, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Eleven, twelve
I'm ready to pop a dozen shells


Gravedigger the nigga behind the trigger so you figure
It's time to hold your own cause you feel you're getting bigger
You once was my son 
I'm Flatline freaking, some Glock gonna burst
And all my enemies bodies are in a hearse
Let's visit the graveyard like the rabbit and the turtle
Jumping over tombstones like jumping over hurdles
I loaded the pump like the back of my hand
I'm like  mortuary van
God damn, it's fitting 
I got a gun I never run I never will I never ran
I'm coming six feet deep
I went into the crypt without your grave
A peaceful nigga
Six or seven bullets to his brain
What's my name?

And where I'm from?

I'm from the Flatline Massive, gun in the darkness
Sparking a fucking philly in the casket
You wanna puff? The plant is rough...tough guy
You coming dead, never live 
All I wanna do is zooma zooma zooma zoom
Bust a .44 and put your ass in a tomb

Livin' peace so it can beat like a drum from the ghetto
Give all peace wont let is go
Say we wouldn't make it
Now we some of the greatest
Bumpin' through the trunk and yo ra yo radioooo

Yo don't love me now
And you'll never love me again
 you cant say it
You would never
?

For tru thugs from the double glock
A nigga ready to rumble
When trouble nocks
Two one way tickets straight off the block
We gonna this pay
Yall niggaz jus watch
'All eyes on me'
Like my name is Pac
Fuckin' hip hop clock
Gotta pass the glock
Takin' drastic shots
Till these bastards stop
When the casket drop
I be mashin' out
In brand new drop top flyin'nigga


Killin' them niggaz witta automatic weapon
When they step up
They get hit up wit the AK-47
Anybody tryna git the muthafuckin' blessin'
They betta not mess wit mine cuz I'm tellin'
Any you niggaz run up again
That it ain't no pretendin' go for sin u gonna git in
Boy you betta listen listen listen


If you get a change of foot
Inch for inch
You betta do it do it
Grab the game
Do it to it
Chase to chase
But still hood
Live it or love it
Dummies of the rocks
Duck up out of my hood hood hood

 mo murder them all 

? The wind blow
Never see me cuz I get ghost
So a nigga neva get close
I go fast or slow
No matter the tempo
Murda the instrumental
Murda the rhythm
I ride to the rhythm of murda
Its murda
This lyrical venom I serve a
Gone kill 'um at minimal murda
Nigga burn some some
Stick wit rans dats' that cash

We got the hood hot lock
Even got the burbs bumpin' bumpin'
They probably tryna get in
Don't nobody wanna be left in the wind

Uh-oh
Niggaz that's not tryna listen to Bone
The early bird get the worm
Take the game by the throat and squeeze
Till the muthafucka broke believe
Its murda we wrote
Its dope that we serve on the curb to the booth
These niggaz don't feel it cuz we spit the truth
Aint never no fake and they got me to prove
Haters just hate and we do what we do
Let 'um talk to you in the face
Only because we blew up in they face
If was Bone hurtin'
If that was the case
I'll probably go loco and catch me a case
Nigga jus move and give me some space
When I let the wind blow in my face
Nigga don't quit till I finish the race
Number one is the place

 I mean yeah, it's all up to you. You gotta be determined to bring this vision into your life bro'! If God has put something on your heart, it's up to you to take the faith and bring this thing into reality.  I mean you gotta be determined by all means necessary! You gotta bring the unseen to the scene. You know what I mean? 

You need your basic information before you can leave earth.
And the B-I-B-L-E is the source of the true words.
Some choices they do hurt, faith is dead without works.
From the minute you was birthed, you only find it when you search.
I'm prepared for the worst, but strive for the best.
It's survival of the fittest. I'm alive, so I'm blessed.
With my eyes bare witness, while I'm praying for forgiveness.
I'm a give it all I got, from the start to the finish... finish.

Oooh, every day we pray,  yes we pray!  Oooh, every day we pray,  yes we pray!  You must need determination, determination. Don't let distractions replace it - you can make it! You must be strong and be patient!  'Cause it must be determination, determination.

I'm tryin' to make it to the finish line, 
but I'm cursed in the worst way, Satan was a friend of mine. 
'Til I woke up and I realized  association with the fakers and haters I had to minimize.
Have you seen the bad side of a Gemini? Its' been a really bad vibe between him and I.
Nigga die, I'm trying to rise to the occasion.
Determined that I make it, no matter what I'm facin'!


We are born with God given purpose and that's certain,
Everybody got work to put in for the lord,
See we nothing but servants,
What goes to move toward,
gotta be strong, and determined to march forward,
Every now and then I slip and go backwards,
But I refuse to loose heart, and that's a fact.
Life is like a war we probably loose a few battles
If you let them they send you up the creek with out a paddle.

If you dream it you can reach fam.
Determination is a hustle with a good plan, understand?
Set some goals, grab a hold of your toes,
cause rest only comes to the dead and gone
and a nigga leaves every time the sun comes up
life is hard filled with deeds and trials you can overcome
Destiny is coming is not a face you can run from
Listen to the wise you can make it past phase one
Ignorance will have you stuck out in the cold


Once in your heart then there's nothing can stand in your way...  determination! 

Determination. We Pray.
But what am I giving away
But what am I giving away
Laying the rhythm with Lay
And did the chorus with Kray
Hanging with Wish
You had Flesh out of the penitentiary
Ride for the desire 
Give me the strength God I got whipped,
Look upon, load up a clip, and go get it,
Never confuse, better to move, ride and do it,
She really ain't nothin' to it,
Me & Cupid never cool with, ooohh baby never cool with
 ~~ don't stress I got you.... been a bone fan since they came out.... great job tho! )

Three wheel motion around the corner on these niggaz mayne
Smashin down the block, Charlie O beat in the deck
Game, what it do? 

They love the way a nigga hop them six-fours and shit
The way I, push buttons make them Diablo doors lift
The way I, stick and move, when I'm behind the wheel
of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
The way I, peel back niggaz jerseys
It ain't your life, I'm just not a big fan of James Worthy
So wait 'til I see y'all, I'm real surgical with the Ruger
But you won't catch my face on E.R.
But you might catch them dudes from the ambulance
Squattin on top of ya mans givin 'em each CPR
Tryin to get 'em to ""Breathe Again"" like Toni Braxton
Told y'all 'bout comin to Cali, with them phony accents
Hollywood got movies, but it ain't no actin
So wear that bling to them awards like it ain't no jackers
We chain snatchers 

When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive
When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive
Fuckin with this cash - eat ya beats alive
Cause it's all about math - eat ya beats alive
When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive
When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive
All about this cash - eat ya beats alive
Nigga all about math - eat ya beats alive

It ain't nuttin to spray you faggots
Or have your moms get you a Burberry suit so you look good in that casket
It's  you faggots, desperado in tact
June, Drago, The Game and D-Mac 
Come through in a grim reaper black Cadillac
Seven-three, ooh-wee, you see, who he
With the ugliest, flows, money hungriest
Oh, the kid got hoes, you ain't know?
Head is never optional, get my whistle, blizzow
Carry pistols, to your Sources and your Grammys
Of course it's that nigga that kick down doors
And leave rooms filled with corpses, Jordan and bloody Air Forces
To get my dough I come back like Air Jordan
Same shot, lil' older, still no nigga can hold him
Stepped back, sold crack let the Compton streets mold him
Big face said I could it, he'll bet you a G


See I'm the nigga with the most flow
Figgaro from killer Cali, reppin Get Low, niggaz know
Independent with my hustle
Couldn't give a fuck money or muscle it's time to bubble
West coast is the place where we holdin it down
Bay area thuggin, they knowin it now
I'm from the home of the Get Low, home of the get dough
Home where they want mo' so niggaz get they pistol
Run up in yo' back do', lookin for the cheddar cheese
Canary wristwatch on celebrities
Diamond bezelled iced out with hella cheese
And every fuckin link is like a masterpiece
Catch 'em slippin comin out the Burger King
Parkin lot project life, we like to spark a lot
Better known as a bandit, niggaz cain't stand it
My whole block gets hard like granite

And now that, that is all over
All we've got is the silence

When I touched you
I felt that you still had your baby fat
And a little taste of baby's breath

"You come alive behind closed doors
You've got a problem you can't ignore
So drive your car, light a cigarette
Too young to die, too old to regret
You're tired bloodshot eyes
Rip through my insides every time
Be thankful you're alive
Life's far worse when you have to hide
Blood runs from your pulsing soars
Soaks into your open pores
Your hair fell out onto your plate
You can't believe what you just ate
You're vicious, terrified,
Here and gone at the same time
Your kisses, like drive-bys
I hate it when you say goodbye
Hammer in the rest of your nails
Load the ships and set the sails
You can't hide inside the cold
Will find it's way into your bones
Woah
I guess this is goodbye
I told myself I wouldn't cry
She screams hold me as we lie
I love it when you say goodnight",R&B

When devil was every woman
Remember this dirty unbelievers

Covered with crusades blood
Murdered for the holy cause

Maybe something magical
Would come my way!
Maybe something magical
Would come my way!
I'm fed up, drained out,
Take a bullet, blow my brains out.
Let me end it, let me stop it,
Take my body on the roof and drop it!
I'm in a mess, I'm in a state,
My situation is far from great.
I'm on the downer,
I'm at the bottom,
To be honest, I'm feeling rotten.
I'm on the floor, I'm on the tiles.
I've lost my touch, I've lost my style.
I'm on the edge, I'm on the brink
Imagining blood dripping down the sink.
I miss my girl, I miss my family,
Too much cocaine, too much brandy.
Where's all the romance to this life style,
I need a rain dance, I need a war cry.
Chorus:
Maybe something magical
Would come my way!
I need to rise out of this gloom,
And escape the underlying doom.
I need the Gods, I need the spirit,
I need the people, that really wanna live it!
So set me free out my cage,
Let me run away from the burning rage!
I'm on my own, yet again.
It's just me, the T.V. and my pen.
I've pissed away everything I have,
Yesterday I rolled off the track.
All the beauty I've created
Turned me into everything I hated.
But I won't let it drown me,
No I won't leave this party.
Cause it's early and I'll do it!
Any problem, I'll have to chew it.
I won't be broken,
The words were spoken!
Hold their meaning.
I'm still dreaming,
I'm in hell, I'm in a trap.
I feel the punch, I feel the slap!
I feel the sting. I feel the pain.
I see my whole life dripping down the drain.",Hip-Hop

"Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
And was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartace
I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith
Kept my faith
And the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
I don't regret a single moment
Looking back, when I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh, I just laugh
And the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we share was meant to be
It's only love",R&B
"When we came to the station all the trains were rusty
The doors were open and the windows broken in
There was grass in all the cracks and the air hung musty
The travel posters were flapping in the wind
So we moved through the dust and gloom
Playing waiting games in the waiting-room
Lay our sleeping-bags out on the floor
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go
If I followed the coast road, I'd be home by evening
The harbor lights still cut across the bay
From the slot machine arcade the lights go streaming
To the bikes outside the rock 'n' roll cafe
Ah but you know those small town blues
Are really too much to lose
There's nothing really there to go back for
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go
Any railway station would be just fine, fine, fine
To settle down and wash the cobwebs from your head
Oh, if your situation's running dry, dry, dry
Find a waiting-room beneath the stars to make your bed'
Cause you know London can make your brain stall
The streets get cold and empty on a rainy night
So you duck into the subway station, you can hear the trains call
They want to take you to the Earl's Court Road, but it don't seem right
Cause it's na, na, na noowah
On the juke-box, singing in the burger bar
See the people's faces in the passing cars don't want to know
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go
You have the most appealing surface I have seen
Bring it over here, lay it down by me
Don't mean to make you nervous, I just mean
To make you see, this is the place to be
When we came to the station all the trains were rusty
The air was empty and the platforms overgrown
There were old tin cans and cats and the doors were crusted
With mud and leaves and names carved long ago
And the rails go on for ever in a silver trail to the setting sun
You can follow them anywhere you want to go
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a need to know",Rock
"A Hello like before
I'd never come here
If I'd known that you were here
I must admit though
That's it's nice to see you, dear
You look like you've been doing well
A Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again, that's kiss and tell
Hello like before
I guess it's different
'Cause we know each other now
I guess I've always known
We'd meet again somehow
So that it might as well be now

I saw your picture in the paper today girl
All 'a sudden it hit me
You're someone that should know me
Possibly drive me crazy
In the pages and all over the magazine covers
People gossip about you and your long list of lovers
You don't girl you don't know about me
But you will, that's for sure

Take a little sip with some conversation

I'll show you that I'm not the same
I swear to you I'm not the same, oooh

I've got this question I keep asking myself
Are you my cure for addiction?
Are you love's definition?
Or just bad for my health?
There's only one way to find out
What we need is each other
Make our own little story
We could start it today

I want you to know my name
Girl, I just ain't got no shame
Them other guys causing you pain?
I'll show you that I'm not the same

This is how it's gonna look, just like this

"The sun came up and five years gone
Life goes on, yeah life goes on
I wonder how you're gettin' by
The sun goes down and I feel blue
Now I toss 'cause my mind's on you
And I kind of miss your broken smile
Save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me
I remember you and me
Lost and young and dumb and free
And unaware of years to come
Just a whisper in the dark
On the pavement in the park
You taught me how to love someone
So save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me
When we walk into the sun
Or burn below for what we've done
Will you still call out for me
Turn to light or fade to black
You don't look back, no you don't look back
And what you meant now born a sea
So save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me
The sun goes down and five years gone
Life goes on, yes life goes on
I hope you caught up with your dreams
I hope you saved part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me

Ignore the fear, show no mercy

I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a 
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Cause Martin Luther King had a 
Aaliyah had a , Left Eye had a 
So I reached out to Kanye and 

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B; bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open

Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed

Pierce my heart if you please,

Though you sneer, and crack wise
I won't waver, but

Now slip that gown off your head,

Will fashion a day when you'd be tender,
When you'd be kind.

Gave you cold-hearted pride,
You look down on your mother who loves you;
You take without grace - though it smarts -
I don't mind.

Slipped as you gripped his gun
And found yourself o'er his
Lifeless body.

Claim that it was my sin,

"Summer, summer and the sun is settin' later than late
I try to stop you but you say it isn't worth the wait
If I could give away the keys to the kingdom I would
I'm sorry, sorry but I think you may have misunderstood
If you wanna burn it down
If you wanna start again
If you wanna turn around then go ahead
If you wanna go alone
If you wanna see it through
If you really need to know I'm tellin' you
I could tell it was too late to take it back
Play the song or the credits, let it fade to black
Out of script, out of time and the scene is done
Call a car, call a friend if you can call anyone
If you wanna burn it down
If you wanna start again
If you wanna turn around then go ahead
If you wanna go alone
If you wanna see it through
If you really need to know I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you
If we never meet again
If we only seem to lose
If you had to turn it in, what would you choose?
If we have a chance tonight
If you wanna wait to see
If you wanna get it right, what's stoppin' me?

If you wanna start again

She ain't trippin' off you, she got your whole crew in love
Your day dreamin' of getting her in the bedroom alone
Straight feedin', You's beg like a dog for the bone
And she's peepin', and the reason is she knows
Theres a demon in between your legs with a mind of its own
Now, you're a weakling, overwhelmed with hormones
Y'all start speakin', she grabs the number to your phone
And next weekend you invite her to your home
You weren't even thinking. You got played by a pro
She's a big shot. Thick lips, nice legs, green eyes
Took advantage of a thousand. Only slept with three guys
Ain't a hoe or a groupie. Jane Doe or a Lucy
Her innocent looks are deceving, so I'm telling you to be wise
I know she's a cutie, but there's power in that coochie
Underneath those booty tight, cutoff, daisy-dooksy Levi's

She's a big shot. You know your dream girl
She knows how to use her looks to take advantage of the world
She's a big shot. You thought you could school her
She dissed you like you were neutered, and told you to go get a sexual tutor
She's a big shot. She wouldn't touch your ruler
She's so beutiful. A cute but cruel looter, user and abuser
She's a big shot. Your eyes are glued to her behind
You know her steeze, but you fall for it every time
Now, what about that popular school kid?
The always have been, always will be cool kid?
The class president valedictorian. ""A plus"", star quaterback
Cadillac convertible drivin', signin' cheerleaders autorgraphs
The letter on the jacket. Medal around the neck
Pin on his chest, and mind on his rep
He only dates models. Drinks his Summit from the bottle
When he walks he waddles, and he ain't never lost a squabble
He put you in the locker, and took your girlfriend to prom
He's in your life everyday, and you can't wait 'til he's gone
But daddy owns a business, so it won't be long
Before he inherits it, makes carats, and sings a rich man's song
He's got the most expensive clothes and jewerly to wear
While your looking for a job, he's looking in the mirror
He walks the halls surrounded by is fan club
Starts fads, ends trends, and hits the ceiling when he stands up
He's a preppy, fame hoggin', pig headed fool
When he has a party, everyone's invited except you
And your crew. And there really ain't nothin' y'all can do
He's in every state, city, and town, as long as they got a school

He's a big shot. Thick knot in his wallet
Parents got enough money to send your whole family to college
He's a big shot. Testosterone thirsty
Hallway fahter figure with his masculianity stained on his jersey
He's a big shot. I.B. class whiz-kid
Braggin' about a big dick, that chick and this chick
He's a big shot..
My favorites are rappers, the egoistical bastards
The people that never clap for your set, they think you're whacker
Than them 'cause they're the masters
I bet disaster is caused in their mind when you rhyme
and plaster their jaws shut with a fat verse
To him you're a hazard. Weak matter. A reason for laughter
He's preachin' he's live. But he's only that word backwards
After he dies, you can climb the ladder, start a chapter
Art you'll capture finally.
But while he breathes, m.c.'s don;t even flatter him
Add a tad if his acrobatical arrogance
To his genteically engineered emotional pattern of tearin' kids in battles
That'll explain why he mean mugs. He told ya' your team sucks
Said you dream of choking him with that mic cord
Instead, he blows your mind straight out your head
He says, ""Fuck You!"" with clarity. You cry hysterically
As it makes a parody of your passion
You tell friends you think he's tight
but secretly, you hope his career won't be lasting
'Cause he's an asshole. But you know he's got nice sound
You know what else? Your looking at him right now

I'm a big shot. Don't front, you know you love me
Girls never wash their hands after they get a chance to touch me
I'm a big shot. Hey, you can say I'm a creep
But put me in a room with your idols and I'll make 'em look weak
I'm a big shot. Shit, can nobody fade me
The only way we can do a song is if somebody pays me
I'm a big shot. Big Shot. Big Props

"One day you're happy the next day you're blue
You feel like the whole world's comin' right down on you
There ain't nothin' wrong but then there ain't nothin' right
It's just the kind of thing that keeps you up all night
Heavy tears in your eyes
Lord don't they hurt you when you cry
Heavy tears in your eyes
And when they hit the ground don't they make a terrible sound
Maybe she loves you and maybe it's a joke
And maybe that fire was just a whole lot of smoke
You don't feel warm but then you don't feel cold
You're just gettin' weary you're just gettin' old
Heavy tears in your eyes
And your mind can't take this worry and your heart feels underfed
Maybe you'll wake up tomorrow or maybe you'll just stay in bed
Don't call the doctor and ask his advice
Cause he's felt the same way himself once or twice
And there ain't no cure for the tear in your eye
You just gotta sit there you just gotta cry
Heavy tears in your eyes",Rock
"In an unheard dream you're the pantomime
Your footsteps creep in the doorway
Blue eyes that burn their way through mine
A silk temptress fading
My memory knows the reasons why you cannot stay with me
You're gonna leave the world behind
As you walk out that door I tremble
As you turn I scream ""leave the light on""
I am a fool for you
I'm sure I don't have all the answers
You're a dreamchaser...
Moving faster now in the hopes to find
A fire that will ignite you
The chance to breathe, to open your eyes

I FIND MYSELF AT THE END OF THE EARTH
LOOKING BACK AT WHAT I LEFT BEHIND
WAS IT WORTH LEAVING ALL THAT I LOVE
JUST TO SEARCH FOR MY OWN PEACE OF MIND?
Moving on, yes it was me in that picture
Leaning on your shoulder
You said I meant the world, you said we'd have it all
Clearly I was wrong
How many nights did I beg you
""Take me with you. Take me away""
You said ""I'm coming back""
But you never came back for me...

"Take them from us, the pitiful ones
Pleading for bleak light's return... betrayed by impending dusk
Finding no solace in the deeply lowering gloom
They travel the path of the condemned in silent horror
Onward into the unspeakable, no savior awaits in forgiveness
Lead us unto ruin, devourer of hope
In night's solemn presence
The accursed procession approaches their destiny
Fields in neglect; unconsecrated by blood and monumental agony
Behold, crosses for the dead
Their distorted shadows forewarn the tragedy
The lurking fear tightens with each labored breath
May we curse the gods in our final hour; the ones they have abandoned
The dead and the dying; all sought in vain their own divine rescue
Begin the mortification of flesh, limbs transfixed upon wooded stakes
Extinction of thy very being;
Hammerfalls resound through the gently sloping hills...
Burn the dead now; let the ashes scatter without remembrance
As those without hope, forgotten in eternity",Metal
"As I came down through Dublin City
At the hour of twelve at night
Who should I spy but a Spanish lady
Washing her feet by the candlelight
First she washed them, then she dried them
Over a fire of amber coals

A maid so sweet about the soul
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye
As I came back through Dublin City
At the hour of half past eight
Who should I spy but the Spanish lady
Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
First she brushed it, then she tossed it
On her lap was a silver comb
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so fair since I did roam
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye
As I returned to Dublin City
As the sun began to set
Who should I spy but a Spanish lady
Catching a moth, in a golden net
First she saw me, then she fled me
Lifted her petticoats o'er her knee
In all me life I ne'er did see
A maid so fair as the Spanish lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Ray lady
Whack for the Too Rye, ooh, Rye aye
I've wandered north and I have wonder south
Through Stoney Barter and Patrick's close
Up and around, by the Gloucester Diamond
And back by Napper Tandys' house
Auld age has laid her hands on me
Cold as a fire of ashy coals
But there is the love of me Spanish lady

Just having something very special now, can it last very long?
Do you doubt just how I feel, can you tell that it's for real?
Just sharing certain feelings we all know,
The truth down from within

Listen, but I can only show you, at times it's so hard with life,
We've gone this far and made it work,
You've got to know, that part is true,
Can you tell, that what I say, comes from my heart, it's taken time,
To make me find your heart, I don't mind
You seem to doubt my sincerity, I'm hoping that you see,
Just try to look much deeper, then you'll know just how I feel,
Will you try to understand, sometimes I may get out of hand,

And I want you here with me

I'm painting it homesick 'cause all that I love is behind me
I hope you still find me
Soon I'll be paying for taxis and riding in backseats
On my way back to hotels when I want my own bed

Yeah E-40 and the muthafuckin see-l-I-see-k in this muthafucka, you know

We fin to spit some of this old flamboyant shit, check game-
It`s another one of them drought spots, a ha-bin cost is like fuck it
Niggaz taken loses that they can`t make up
Gettin gaffled for some of that shit call cake-up
Strechin the crap, making a bad batch
The screen from a trweekers pipe turns black
So they go crazy, get hot-headed, start actin` a fool yellin`
But ya`ll know there ain`t no refunds in the shit that I`m sellin
'cause during the drought season niggaz be lookin` for a reason to rush ya
So I suggest you put up your bootsees man and pull out your buckets

Here`s another part of this shit that a niggaz up lift about the game
The drought season main, 'cause this shit here never remains the same
And a brother ain`t about to let his muthafuckin capital go mein
So instead he gots to get scandlous
'cause he can`t keep up and handle hisbuisness
Like he use to and he ain`t really wit being through, get to it dude
Gotta pull a straight come-up, lick
Catchin` muthafuckas outta bounds swerv,
Breakin they punk ass leavin scared
'cause this is the type of shit that occur
So don`t get caught loose on perv

I gots meals, wheels, and about 5 thousand dollars worth of bills
Bank account way on the red, fuckin with the highest overhead
Jackin off my money yo ass is out boy and I promise you that
I`m a money hungry muthafucka and I`m so serious about my scratch
So you`re best bet is
To check yourself before you wreck yourself punk botch
I gets down and dirty like Dr. Ruth and I put that on the Gooch
Droppin muthafuckas just like a bad habit, Dag nab it
Tricks want to get outta line I let `em have it
Now bag it, I gots Ice Cream Candy
And all kinds of things of that flavor
And maybe later I might be willing to go low as long as you buyer before
'cause I`m the only muthafucka with A-1 Yola,
None of that ol caken with baking soda
It gets released, ceased, and then the prices rises like yeast
Those who gots leftovers will become obese,
Triplin` my mail off the triple beam scale
I even got enemies with envy askin` me for yayo
Chorus -
The Drought Season niggaz lookin` for a reason
It`s like Thanksgiving without the feast -n 

A niggaz tryin to work hard on a meal ticket so I can`t stand to be dry
'cause after the stronger man supply
But in the drought season it`s too hard to get by
Niggaz be runnin` off with D gafflin muthafuckas, startin at chances
'cause a niggaz mail ain`t to muthafucka fancy,
Rollin around with a duece and a quarter
Can`t get caught lose on the border, sittin on them thangs like 40
Stay fuckin with a bitches brain

Can`t be affected by the great depression
This country is in a recession, I reckon
So let me give yo ass a funky lesson-
Never let a muthafucka know what you got or what you buyin
It`s dem bootsee muthafuckas in your town that`s always dyin`
Stay low, play the background, keep your shit on a hush mate
Hit it hard one time and then hibernate

Now check game I`m tryin to do my own muthafuckin` thang
But shit just ain`t right
For heaters that just got way to tight, Jackin muthafucka`s on sight
But I`m a nigga that don`t give a fuck
When I`m tryin to get my cashflow up
And render them seasons what ever the reason may be, niggaz comin up
Short tye, Gag, Watch em short out from sea,
For sale signs on a nigga`s shit
'cause he ain`t got no muthafuckin` D,
Sellin` up everything made of material G

I`m really not all sure about them thangs that fin to mature
But let me find me a nigga with a grip and hit his ass quick with a lick
What`s your definition of a lick?
Takin` a niggas shit
Hey, put that on sumptin
I put that on the click,
If you consider yourself a hustla can`t be no busta brown
Stackin mail, straight come upin`, when funk come around be down

A nigga`s gotta have some type of hustle
Whether it be sellin` Dank or robbin banks
Snitches can`t go to the pen 'cause they fuck around and wind up shanked
In the presence of drought season shit gets hectic
Niggaz losin they lives when they least expect it

It`s E-40 and my cousin Kaveo lettin` muthafuckas know main
Spittin that ol shit that muthafuckas don`t understand an
Tardy to the crazy ass game, never gotta be clever

"
Sleeping in the night it hears a sound
It gets up to take a look around
It finds there's no one there
It falls into a Black tears nightmare
Darkness surrounding, hells breaking loose
Tries to get out but its no use
Faster and faster it starts to turn
Better slow down or it will burn
Schizophrenia passes into the mind
Thinking that it will painfully die
Clasping and grasping for a breath
It learns that it is near death

"A barbaric land where the sword is the law,
and killing is the way of life.
An infernal wasteland and down a barren plain;
A warrior stands the test of fate.
His face is cracked from the wicked hands of time,
and scars from war have past,
Taking the reins from a shadowy steed,
I shall kill the foyus at it's layer!
Morbid Scream!
Skulls and bones lie relics in the sand;
Remembrance of men that came before.
The ground is scorched from the dragon's breath,
and corpses burned to stench and ash.
I awake in fury when the dragon attacks;
Advancing in anger - spitting fire.
Our barbarous laws, my thundering axe,
yet we'll fight the beast to it's death!",Metal
"i can feel a pull from the outside world
a lonely shadow in the moonlit night
i can feel a pull from the outside world
please pull me up with the oceans
music is seen colors are heard
a dark vision of senses
is this tasting the world?
to ruin the illusion
is this primal or futile?
is this instinct or evil?
is this right or wrong?
i can feel a change
yes i can feel a change inside me
inside you
gnash's through each stranger in the night
your eyes will be opened
it will be too bright to see reality
when i wake up
in the morning
the taste lingers
on my lips
a love lost a lovers breath
whats best for me tonight is to let my coat fill in
a swift killer at each bite
people change when the pleasure starts to spoil
to my touch vivid colors appear
dark visions it was all too bright to see
reality what if this is all there is?
so sad to hear
oblivious to the obvious thats you
thats you
a love lost a lovers breath
whats best for me tonight is to let my coat fill in
i'll be on my way in flight",Metal

"JEFF CANADY

'63 Cedarwood Publishing
Hurry hurry children you better get a runnin'
Jeff Canady's comin' and he eats little youngin's
His wife is a witch and Jeff can switch
From a snake To a frog or an old mad dog
So you better leave him alone
My sister was a backward child she never walked a step
She crawled around the old home place and always needed help
At eight years old she never walked and never went to school
The teacher said she couldn't help she'd grow to be a fool
We took her to a fine surgeon he said dear folks I dread
The body's strong but her mind won't go it's something in her head
Now there was a bum who walked around way back in those days
And momma would say we'd better be good or he'd take us kids away
Hurry hurry children you better get a runnin'...
We sheltered Sis from snakes and frogs and when the mad dogs came
But the one thing that she feared the most was old Jeff Canady's name
One day old Jeff came down the road when sister played alone
She screamed and squirmed and then decided she was there alone
She jumped and ran to momma's arms as Jeff went on his way
But thank the Lord my sister walks until this very day
Guess old Jeff is walking yet down heavens lonesome mile
But beneath his beard I swear I bet he wears a great big smile
Hurry hurry children you better get a runnin'...",Country

Some will turn to white lies just as well

Always watching your watch
You're always right on time

Will someone put me out?
Reaching for the stars above the clouds
I'm burning
Come clean

"You say you came to save the day
But now it's evening
And all your victims have gone home
You claimed to take nothing away
But you kept stealing
These things you could never own
Last night I drove to go nowhere at all
And came to the saddest thing I ever saw
A pretty girl all strapped up in an ugly car
Driving through a shady crowd of criminals
Truth comes in waves leaving no trace
Or any meaning
To all the bad things we've done
True hate won't wait and love comes too late
Into this evening
Into this night so dark and cold
Last night I drove to go nowhere at all
And came to the saddest thing I ever saw
Another pretty girl inside an ugly car
Driving through a shady crowd of criminals
A little bleeding
A sinking feeling
The victim I would never know",Rock
"When you're young and so in love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people get a soul
Ony those in love would know
What a town without pity can do
If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how ""bad"" we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do
The young have problems
Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us
Before this plain granted planet falls apart
Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do",Rock
"Removal of the eyes gives my heart a saddened chill
I preserve them in formaldehyde to gaze upon at will
How their greenish flecks befell me that starlit winter's night
I lost all that I ever was while locked within their sight
Before you sits a broken man, your fragile pinkish heart in hand
Peculiar how it can hurt so bad while love is only in the mind
I sew the gaping chest work, each thread is made with love
The bosom where I would rest my face is covered in your blood
No, this is not the end
You'll live on eternally
Oh Lord, it's not the end
My secret you'll forever be
I interrupt this transformation, a familiar lust swelling in me
A long and soulful kiss, the shades are drawn, the living world can't see
The coil of entrails, how curious the smell
So pungent to my eager nostrils, hands further compelled
No, it's not the end
Forever you'll be in my arms
I could never let you go, my darling, cold and blue
I wonder, are you dreaming still, spread eagled, blood removed
I weave the sucking trocar beneath your bruising skin
Tonight I'll lay beside you, darling, in necromantic sin
Pinned to the bed sheets like a prized butterfly, you're mine
I hear your voice so precious, echoing deeply inside
I did my best to love you while you did live and breathe
This tender taxidermy, trophy of the bereaved
I could never let you go, my darling, cold and blue
I wonder, are you dreaming still, spread eagled, blood removed
I weave the sucking trocar beneath your bruising skin
Tonight I'll lay beside you, darling, in necromantic sin",Metal

Where I'd hoped to aim for is not what fate saw fit to bring

But if life's just killing time
With no reason and no rhyme let the peace and grace and light of sunday

In twisted tongues that taunt for evil deeds

Beyond control - unveil my pain

In a reflecting eye I see them die
Heartbeat that silently decays
Sinking deep into the Earth's hungry soil

With a new mask
Trying to hide
From the guilt
Of my killing hand

Folds her hands and...

Can you tell that you drive me crazy?

When I wake up think of ya again
You are my homie, lover and friend

"Outside the battle ragin' death upon us
No surrender unchained and free
Insanity will lead to blind destruction
Crush the evil, the foul disease
Our final destination reborn in darkness
Watching and waiting destroying with ease
The judgement day upon us as dawn is breaking
Mankind will fall to the spineless deceived

Fly through the storm, power of the steel
Striking with vengeance, force them to kneel
Soldiers unite, force of the world
Fight till the end we will die by the sword
Fight on in foreign fields of mass destruction
Stand as one, no man left behind
Our final victory, tonight awaits us
Slain in darkness behind the lines
Raise the dead, ride beside of me
Fallen heroes, of a thousand moons
Blaze ahead the price that they now pay
On the march to their doom

Fight till the end we will die by the sword
Light the fires of freedom, on the shores of endless seas
Wings of glory guide us, on the path to victory
Light the fires of freedom, on the shores of endless seas
Wings of glory guide us, on the path to victory
Outside the battle raging death upon us
No surrender unchained and free

again you break,

and bleeding a luxury.

every person, every eye stare,
but they'll never see through,
the walls built around you.
So tired and so weak,
whisper, scream and speak,
words is just a symbol of,
the dream of a life above.
Again you shake,
again you break,
your life feels like misery,
and bleeding a luxury.
You're not gonna make it this way,

"So there goes my life
Passing by with every exit sign
It's been so long
Sometimes I wonder how I will stay strong
No sleep tonight
I'll keep on driving these dark highway lines
And as the moon fades
One more night gone, only twenty more days
But I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now
And there goes my life
Passing by with every departing flight
And its been so hard
So much time so far apart
And she walks the night
How many hearts will die tonight
And when things have changed
I guess I'll find out in seventeen days
But I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now
My body aches
And it hurts to say
No one is moving
And I wish that I weren't here tonight
But this is my life.
And I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now

Holds the golden key to my inspiration

To make it loud, make it clear
All the distance disappears
Street felony, instigation
It's inner city heat across every station
Beat melody combinations
In every word I say
Of my conversation
I use it now, I used it then
When discotheque was my best friend
I boomed it loud, I made it clear
I rearranged my atmosphere

It permeates your atmosphere

Come alone
I wish I would have listened when I figured out
You knew me from the inside
Your eyes on mine, on mine, and I'm
I'm afraid and alone with your eternal love in my hands
And this bread, your body
I know, I know, I know, you know
Come alone
From the garden to the hill
Come my love
I have fallen
I have betrayed
So irresolute in my mind
I can't stop pacing, anticipating
Could this be my fate in the end?
Cause I'm afraid in the light of the look in your eyes when they're locked on mine
I turn away, cause I know you see right through me
Come alone
From the garden to the hill
Come my love
I have fallen
I have betrayed you
Here I lie
My guilt is my sentence
You have been my life
I will end it with a kiss
Come alone, my love
My love, my love

"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

"In het hart van de nacht
Toonde hij zijn ware gezicht
Hij zei wat hij dacht
Tegen schimmen in het schemerlicht
Maar al zijn goedbedoelde woorden gingen verloren
Door het toeval gebracht
Onnodig en onverwacht
Want hij kwam op voor het goede
Waarom moest hij bloeden
In die donkere nacht
Chorus:
Hij was zo jong, zo jong, maar nooit bang
Voor wat de toekomst brengen zou
Hij was zo jong, zo jong, 't is zo wrang
Omdat hij iemand helpen wou
Wat zijn dag had moeten zijn
Werd met een harde dreun geveld
't Werd een dag van stilte en pijn
Omdat elk mensenleven telt
Vanwaar die blinde woede
Waarom moest hij bloeden
Door dat zinloos geweld
Chorus
Er blijven mensen achter, achter in de tijd
Die niets meer kunnen doen
Die moeten leven met het feit
Ik schrik van de berichten, ze grijpen me aan
Ik kijk naar de gezichten, er zijn teveel gegaan

"""Welcome Home""
-Eric Bogle
Now when the boys came home, Annie cried and Annie cheered
She'd been on her own for a long and lonely year
Living for his letters from far away Vietnam
And dreading the official telegram
So she was waiting at the station when his train came rolling in
She ached with anticipation of holding him again
And suddenly he was standing there in his crumpled uniform
In a heartbeat she was in his arms
Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
Did you wonder, over there,
When you were tired, when you were scared,
If your country really cared, welcome home
When a nation goes to war, everyone's a casualty
Some are maimed and scarred, most have wounds you cannot see
So in place of the man that she had known,
Annie found instead, a sick and troubled stranger in her bed
But she was stubborn, she was lovin', so she stayed all through the years
The hard times and the drinking, the nightmares and the tears
For where hate is muddy quicksand, love is tempered steel
Annie waited for his wounds to heal
Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
We're just so glad that you're alive
And only you will wonder why
You lived when others died, welcome home
So on a sunny Sydney morning, I heard old war drums beat
And watched the boys come marching, down the city street*
To claim their place in the nation's heart
That their blood and pain had earned
A nation that rejoiced in their return
And if the day helped to heal some wounds is a matter of debate
For some it had come none too soon, for others far too late
But I found myself hoping, as the boys went marching past
That for them the war was over, at last
Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
What you went through in Vietnam, we can't begin to understand
But to each and every man, welcome home
Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
May the years bring you release, as the memories decrease
May you find some kind of peace, welcome home
May you find some kind of peace, welcome home

"I feel you
To every girl who ain't never had a daddy
And every boy who ain't never have a mother
To that pretty woman lost in the world
Who seem to think another man won't love her
All the homies locked up in the pen
Who can never seem to dodge that trouble
Hold your head up high 'cause there's better days,
hard times I was praying for them better ways
I don't know a niggas struggle but I know pain
Cold world but a nigga trying to maintain
Still praying for a little change
Bills due and I can't pay
Or when your money low when your rent late
And doc say granny gone after thirty days
You don't even know the half of my heartache
Too many I done lost is a heartbreak
And they wonder why this young nigga goin' hard
I done came too far from my boulevard
Couple war wounds, few battle scars,
But I'm still here living gotta thank God.
Its a cold world, it don't love you
Funny what a little faith and a hope do
Lord
And I know my momma praying for me,
And my granny praying for me,
I'm hustling for my family and thats every day and night,
And the day I witnessed my daughter born
It was the greatest day of my life, my life.
Yeah take a look in my eyes, look how far a nigga came
You can search my soul, you understand my pain
Nigga trust nobody, and that probably never change
With a little bit of hope, you can reach your dreams
For anybody who done ever had a dream,
You are just like me
Still believing in myself even when them niggas hated
And they told me that it could not be
You's a muhfuckin' lie,
motivate a nigga when you see him on the block
Tell me how it feel when you struggle with the bills,
And your momma take pills, and you never seen your pop.
That put a dent right into my childhood,
Still praying that I want to live good.
Selling dope get you hoes and them nice cars,
I'm just thinking if I really should.
Small city young nigga with a mindset
Ain't never trying to be another convict
See I can't lose, and I won't quit
As long as God in my heart then I'm conscious
Remember when they said I wouldn't be shit?
People doubted that I ever had a gift
Who the fuck are you to judge me nigga?
I will never let them sink my ship
Through the trials and tribulations,
Nigga still I stand, thank God in advance
And I know my momma praying for me,
And my granny praying for me,
I'm hustling for my family and thats every day and night,
And the day I witnessed my daughter born
It was the greatest day of my life, my life.
Yeah take a look in my eyes, look how far a nigga came
You can search my soul, you understand my pain
Nigga trust nobody, and that probably never change
With a little bit of hope, you can reach your dreams
Growing up I wanted to be like Jordan,
Even though I couldn't really afford it.
Who's to say I can't be an Obama,
A Tiger Woods worth about a billion dollars?
Everybody wanna sell a little coke,
'Cause its cool to them niggas you know.
Don't nobody wanna be another judge.
Young niggas only looking for the plug 
Watch your momma doing dope
Daddy locked in the pen
And you on your own
Gotta keep your head up
When you're tired and fed up
Better days gon' come
Better days gon' come
And I know my momma praying for me,
And my granny praying for me,
I'm hustling for my family and thats every day and night,
And the day I witnessed my daughter born
It was the greatest day of my life, my life.

Wild as a fox who be runnin' with rabies
Wild as that pedo that's scopin' your block out for months
Cause he's plannin' to eat all your babies

I mean poppin' them bars can turn blues into greys
And I say what I mean and I do what I say
Do you know all the things I could do in a day?
I'm prohibited, nigga, I usually stay
With bitches whose daddies keep two in the safe
 'til they're blue in the face
Hop on the jet then I flew out the states
Label  a view of my face
Considered suicide, I do that these days
I thought about what I could do with my grave
Google search how to make a grenade
Toggle my aim, scribble some names
Took a few breaths, blew out some steam
And I sent that shit out and I blew up the game

I am a little bit out of my brain
Man this shit's a problem, man this shit's a problem, man
I just threw, do you not understand?

I know the devil, man I am his handler
You should not try it, man I have your soul
I really show you the realm of disaster
I am a junkie for fuckin' some antics
I smoke all the flowers, I fill out the pasture
I got my middle finger up to white America
But tryin' to whitewash my blackness
Fuck you, you could never break me
What you mean, my nigga?
Thought I told you I'm not human
I'm machine, my nigga
Go brrratata, boom, bop, bop, bang, bang, my nigga
Think these honkies here don't got us on no genes, my nigga
When it all falls down, I'm a free soul
Now can't nobody take that from me
Not a price in the world, not a diamond or pearl
Ain't a lot that could take that for free
I am wild in the jungle with Tarzan and George
Chillin' high in the trees with a bundle of whores
And I only come back home for fun when I'm bored
I'm made from the flowers, I just raised from the thorns

Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clat
Push your ma'fucka wig back, I did that

She was a good girl till she knew me
Now she is in the drop bussin' U'e

Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights

Just sneak out and meet me, bring me a box of L's

What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's you and me against the world, then so be it

I get all my life from you

There you sit alone and there you shed a solitary tear
Listening to a song you think that no one else would ever hear

Turn life out of any dream

Without you
Warming like the sand
Upon the land

Dark to me the night
And dim the morning light tomorrow

Oh, to see them through
Those days when we think you are gone
They are so lonesome and so long
What shall we do?
Parting comes to soon

Has lost its pleasure
Waiting for the time
This lonely wine
Has lost its treasure

I won't, I won't let it gravel me
But I transgress
Born into sin, born into current
I can't comply to a compliment

And the current still drags me in
Slow down, slow down, down, down

Show me in to permanent sleep, but ohh

Rain washing over me cleaning up my brain
Till I question all my thoughts
And clean 'em up from stains
Clean 'em up from stains
Clean 'em up from stains, yeah
Die free, yeah!
Welcome to the circle of those who know their way
Welcome to those who've realized their needs
Who don't need fear to pray and betray
But they don't accept us living free
Believing what we need
Haven't heard anything about poetry
They only know their painful greed
Don't ever trust those who say they know
Those who show and force you to bow
I've done no wrong but to ask my brain
To be free from pain built up by those who reign

A mind in disguise now I know
It's better to hide my belief than feeding the crow
A life on the run now I know
The kingdom of disguise is the last place to go
In the eyes of the world I'm a master of heresy
Swimming against the tide - endangering democracy
I remember the day when I was young and bold
When I thought that my mind was free
Until the time that I was told
Out in the night they laugh about me and my Knowledge and
Speak prayers our god don't want to hear. But listen:
Wherever you are, I will get you! Well, you don't know who
I am? I am the inquisition and I am your heretics
Barbarian end!
Beware and be silent and follow the sign
Keep the mission as a secret of your mind
One out of a million is a friend of your line
Don't forget there are evil eyes behind
Holding the candle she was found in the rain
Bright eyes and blissful but they thought
That she went astray
Too late to escape, she seemed to be insane
She got imprisoned because she got her own way
Now can't you remember?
What have you done?
Believe me, I'm innocent. I've done no wrong!
But you are strange! You are guilty I guess!
And after the torture you will confess and burn!
Ending in the flames, burning down her fame
Prayers to the saints, their end of an evil game
Run to your last refuge
Maybe the silence of your voice
Lie but be true to yourself
Sometimes you've got no choice
Follow a king called silence
Live in his kingdom of disguise
There is a temple of shelter
Where God forgives you your lies.
Run to your last refuge
Maybe the silence of your voice
Lie but be true to yourself

You motivated us at the shows we see too
And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song
You might have through somethin' hopin' nothin' like Bone

O si tienes novio quizÃ¡ por eso es que ni te consigo
Que yo sigo y no es que este syko quiero ser tu amigo
Yo quisiera hablarte a veces me miro al espejo
Y lo practico por si conversamos no lucir pendejo
Pero a quien yo engaÃ±o?
Yo se que esto me hace daÃ±o
Ya te eh cantado cuatro conciertos de Cristian castro en el baÃ±o
Bajo la lluvia inclusive le agua frÃ­a de mi ducha
Eh llegado hasta el nivel que mis vecinos me escuchan
Me gritan Coscu deja el enfango brother ya no sigas!
Esa gata esta muy dura 'pa ti esta fuera de tu liga
Y todo el mundo dice que tu estas fuera de mi presupuesto
Sin saber que siempre sueÃ±o contigo cuando me acuesto
Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad 
Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad
Estas barras que yo tire 'pa ver si te impresiono y quizÃ¡s me mires
Con los ojos que hacen que todo el dÃ­a el melÃ³n me gire
Yo me esmero le pido a tu prima que me acomode pero ella tira la mala
Ese Coscu que mucho jode !
Madrugada y de noche esta en un cuento de hadas
Yo me pregunto como duermes si con cuantas almohadas
Si tu te arropas o te gusta que te arropen primero
Dime que pensarÃ­as si olleras mis voces de Homero
Yo a ti te espero la noche son largas
Y a veces pienso que no hay otra como tu
En este planeta tan inmenso quiero llegar a conocerte
Y a veces le pido a dios 'pa por si el llega a convencerte
Que te explique de bajas y altas que tengo un mundo para ti
Y tu eres la que falta!
Pero por el momento yo sigo matando las horas
DejÃ¡ndote todo estos mensajes en tu grabadora baby!
La noche no es la misma si no estas aquÃ­
Y en mi mente tu siempre estarÃ¡s
Si es mi alma que no quiere gritar
Solo me siento yo solo recuerdos del amor
I don't know if you're another love
Pienso pienso pienso en ti en ti
Tu amor me saca de la oscuridad
Me lleva hasta la eternidad

"Papa was a simple man papa loved his farming land
Guess I didn't understand please forgive me papa
You can't paint a picture of a man like papa with something as empty as words
'Cause there's no way to measure the thoughness of timber
And compare it to the softness of birds
Papa was both and yet he was neither just a hard working God fearing soul
He gave what he had to the ones that he loved and I guess he loved me best of all
For I was the oldest and we were the closest we worked that old farm side by side
I guess that's the reason it hit me the hardest the morning that my papa died
All I could think of was how hard he'd worked and what little comfort he'd found
I guess that's the reason I hitched up the mule and drove the old buggy to town
I picked out a lot in the big cemetery in the shade of a tall maple tree
Figured it's the least I could do for my papa
After all the things that he's done for me
We gave him a funeral fit for a king and then we laid him to rest in the sod
Somehow I thought that in that big pretty place he just might feel closer to God
The women were crying as they passed by papa the men stopped and all shook my hand
Most of the mourness had gone when I looked up and noticed this white haired old man
He was dressed kinda shabby and he walked with a cane his voice was shaky and low
I had to look twice before I rocognized him he used to work for us a long time ago
They told me this morning that the big boss had died
And I thought that I should come around
I went out to the homeplace to tell him goodbye
They told me that you done brought him to town
I remember your papa used to say that when he died he didn't have but one request
He wanted to be burried out dare on that farm
He said there wadn't nowhere else that he could rest
When I heard what you'd done I fatched me a shovel found me an old paper sack
I scooped up some dirt from up near the farmhouse
And thought that I'd just bring it back
I hope you don't mind if I just sorta scatter these few little pieces of clay
It ain't gonna mess up your pretty green grass he just might sleep better this way

Closed doors. I remember, though memories serve no
Purpose anymore. Wrong direction. I now see what

How I will win every war and the battlefield is all

To say you're devoid of sympathy.
Your forced opression is one thing that I can

Surprise keeps my hatred alive. Be thankful to survive
Because I'm just getting started now...
See how you've gone too far? Attempts to put
Me down won't succed anymore. But, your actions
Will leave a scar.

And maybe if I asked him to
He's sit and talk to me man to man

And it's taking over
rolling me over
seems like it won't stop
. . .
When I feel your touch
then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you!
In my life it's been so uncertain
Ties were broken and it left me hurting
Maybe now I can trust again with you.
And it's taking over
rolling me over
seems like it won't stop
. . .
When I feel your touch
then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you !
'Cause when I see your eyes
then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
that's when I know I want you.
When I feel your touch
then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you !",Pop

"As the they stand in ruins of cities
the children play in ashes
knee deep
in our neglect
our bags in overhead compartments
so secure
we walk with the world underneath our feet
inside these cocoons made of band-aids and foam
to stop the noises from bleeding in
we like our music loud and different to alienate the masses
run into the nightmare of self absorption
we are what it takes to survive
into the night we fall as pilots in paper planes
we race against this coming rain
out running this chance
to prove that we are alive and we're here to stay
we let this go
our only chance to say
our lives meant something more
the air our fists are beating
inside our hearts are bleeding
we race to the end
tonight we're dancing on the edge of reason
pushing envelopes
as if the postman could be tried for treason
our canopy's covered in graffiti
with no parachute we'll crash and burn
baby burn
without your calming fire we'll burn
brilliantly without a cause...",Metal
"
Now see I'm cockrrring up my nine
I'm poprrring in the clip and cap
And let you know what's really happening
With that son of an assassin 
Feelin' this killin' and peelin' caps cause I can't stop
My gangsta attitude comes from my muthafuckin pops kickin' ass
And the #1 Assassin blastin' niggas for nothin'
Peelin caps with a passion
Now, I can remember when I was just a little niggero
Rollin' through the hood with my pops
I watched him kill a ho
Boom  was the sound
Of the nine when they kill ya
So you didn't pay your debt
But you had to pay the consequence

He hit the gas, and we was tickets with the quickness
""G, she tried to play me out
That's the way it gotta be
Yeah,"" that's what he said
""Don't tell a soul, if you love me son""
He gave me a hug. I said, ""I won't
'Cause I know how it's done.""
And now I lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I don't dream
'Cause every night I get a vision of that
Same thing 
And like a fool I'm on a block
We're sellin' mo' dope, fuckin' wit my cash flow
Like pops I let my gun smoke
I made a promise
I won't tell if your askin'
I'm just that muthafuckin son of an assassin

Ever since I was seven I've been a troubled-ass nigga
Used to sneak my father's guns just to play with that triggas

One day I'm playin' with the nine
I get a flashback, and get to thinkin' about
The muthafuckin' bullies in my class
That's always fuckin with me, but this shit's has to stop
The next morning I snuck
And I stuck my father's nine in my lunchbox
I'm on my way to school, that's when I spotted the faggot
Removed the nine from the lunchbox
And slipped the bitch my jacket
Now I'm lookin' for a reason just
To straight let the trigger click
I walked over to him and said
""What's up now, bitch?""
The fucka-sucka started steppin'
And it swung but he missed
I knew the nigga felt pissed
'Cause it was the nine that he kissed
I socked the bitch in the face
And to the ground with this sucka
And this boy didn't hesitate
He broke off quicker than a muthafucka 
Ran inside the building thinking that was gonna save him
But I caught up with the nigga
Pulled out the nine, and I sprayed him
Tossed the gun to the pavement
I'm heading straight for the hizzy
No more will Krayzie be bullied
Cause Krayzie Bone just got busy
Then ran home, told my father
He said ""I know why you did it, son
The punk was fuckin' with ya, so ya had to get rid of him""
Heard a knock on the door, he thought
""Yo, what the fuck is this?!""
Police surrounded my hizzy with reporters and psychologists
My father grabbed his gun and started pullin' the trigger

Now you know why I'm labeled a little crazy-ass nigga
I watched while my Pops continued blastin'
My attitude is hereditary, nigga
'Cause I'm the son of an assassin

My father went in the pen when I was 'bout two or three
They had caught him 
For manslaughter and murder in the first degree
I haven't heard from him in about a month or two
Until one night when I was watchin the eleven'oclock news
'Cause I guess there's some insane inmate
Just now broke out the pen
And he can either be in Lorain
Columbus, or Cleveland
Right then it dawned upon me I'm like
""What in the Hell?!""
And then I heard a ""ring-ring"" on my doorbell
So when I opened the door, and much more to my surprise
Me and my pops was face to face
Lookin' eye to eye 
He said, ""Son I'm on the run
And I don't wanna be alone""
I said, ""Don't say another word
'Cause me and you is gone""
I went upstairs and got the gauge
The pump, the nine's legit
Until holice got in the yard and cold stormed the shit
We jumped up into the hizzy
I threw my daddy the nine
I shot one cop in the chest;
He shot two cops in the spine
You know I'm pullin' the trigger, right
My bullets steadily hittin'
I go to pull it again, shit 
I ran out of ammunition

I reach up for the pump
And in a flash I got dumped and turned around
Holice gonna smoke my ass
I can feel my life  passin'
I know I'm bout to die too
And just before I left I said ""Dad, I love you
""",Hip-Hop

Sorrow and tears

"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
Then maybe at the closing of your day,
You can sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh,
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay.
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadow making hay,
Just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin,
And watch the barefoot gosoons as they play.
Ooh
For the breezes blowing o'er the sea's from Ireland,
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow,
And the women in the uplands digging praties,
Speak a language that the strangers do not know.
Yet the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,
And they scorned us just for being what we are,
But they might as well go chasin' after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star.
And if there's gonna be a life here after,
And faith somehow I'm sure there's gonna be,
I will ask my God to let me make my Heaven,
In that dear land across the Irish sea.
I will ask my God to let me make my Heaven,
In my dear land across the Irish sea.

"With a crime of passion lie those dreams of yesterday
Broken like the snows of January
Silence will fall on those masters of shame
When the family garden wakes to spring again
Under the moon and over land
Make the shadows of the chosen one
With words of mercy in his hand
He walks the path of peace a wounded man
Out of sight and out of mind
The devil`s staircase winding high
Make it secret make it sudden
And the family garden wakes to frosty ground
In Europe's towns tonight
They lie awake again to fear the dawn
An endless story of empty glory",Folk

I've got an appetite for deceit

Cover me in apathy, discreetly and distinctable

My thoughts are just a little sun burnt, dismantle all that ever was,
Strip it down; withdraw the blood
Something's going to break real soon, who's covering those eyes?
Safety in knowing others lies pulled by the strings of time
Hold me back; I'm going to throw it all down on the table
Do you expect us to believe in these fables?
Oh, what to do with you?
With you, with you, with you?
Hold me tight, it seems all I really have is in front of me

A throw back to all those 80's slasher flicks
You're a cheap killer, and I'm getting sick of it
God's dead, and all bets have waived their rights
All is fair in love and time, who will win the game of war?
Illusion, delusion, a terrible secret,
What one does see is another's lost prophet
Hold me close, I can see right through you
Challenge all you've ever heard, incite the search and motivate
Something's going to break real soon, who's covering those eyes?
Safety in knowing others lies pulled by the strings of time

On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say
Take my breath away

Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Through the hourglass I saw you in time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today, I am unafraid
Take my breath away
Take my breath away, oh oh
Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames

I can be Hans Solo and you can be Leia

You're the only girl that makes my floppy disk hard
I can hack in a mainframe but not in your heart
If I could be with you, I'd treat you with kindness
And protect you from harm, like Norton anti-virus
But you are like Hollywood and I'm like Bit Torrent
My love for you is steady like gravitational constants
That doesn't really rhyme
Oh yeah, like Leia and Slater does
Well at least I didn't dress up like Yoda at my star TREK themed birthday party
Well, I was 4 years old
Shut up you are such a nerd
Im just a nerd in love and I feel out of place
Ill have to specialize in gynecology so I can get to 2nd base
Unless she finds sarcasm appealing and greasy hair sexy
I still think she's leet, but she doesn't notice me
I want to be with girl and not get any rejection
Who will dress like a hot alien at star trek conventions
Whos as precious to me as a rare Pokemon
And who knows the difference between and a Warlock and a Shaman

Cause were too much like Steve Urkel and not enough like Stefan

Pearls a droppin from her windowsill
Tears burn and gather in brown eyes

Now young Coreys waitin down by the gate
Cant call the preacher

Try to leave, but I can't stand
Start to think that I'm better off dead

Under the influence, I'll take the consequence
Well if it's poisonous, let it take my last breath

Temptation, creeping up on me
Gets under my skin, won't let me be
Haunt my days and haunt my sleep, viciously unrelenting
Oh, lay down again
Oh, give in again
And oh, feel good again
Begging for another beautiful sin
It's dangerous, the things we do
Under the influence, I got no defense
It might be criminal, but still I just can't quit

Now we've had enough, everybody wants to be tough

Instead of trying to be above
'Cause I see nothin' feminine about givin' your brother some love

I figure still I hustle, tussle with the fool at school
The one that Momma sold my sneakers, thought she says he's freakin' her
Had the doubt until I caught 'em, then I fought 'em, then she slapped me
Hollered at me talkin' 'bout I messed up her ten dollars
Goddamn! Drug dealers dealin' to the kiddies
Livin' in the city ain't no pity on the itty-bitty
We try to cry, but still they all die
I try to speak to the youth, and the truth is they all high
What can I say but watch your back, youngster

It's like a curse, and it hurts 'cause it's worse
Momma's crazy 'cause her baby's in a hearse

I come to you tonight not to scare you or to give you fright
But to make sure that we're still an item and possible spend the night
Perhaps you sure you wern't sleeping in gives me a feeling deep within
I just come up from the ground if we fooled around would it be sin
But wait, you know it almost seems that your not happy to see me
My love that's brought me back to you so please tell me that you've been true
It seems that I've been gone so long my dear my love for you is strong
Death can't keep me away from you in your hands my heart belongs
And I can see that you don't see the sparkle on my face
And I notice that you don't notice that my heart is still in place
So you're upset and you're crying and you're walking out the door
And I'm fine that you don't like me anymore
Now days have passed and so am I, no matter how I try and try
I just can't seem to win you back, maybe it's because lack of hair
It's been falling out, I just can't get rid of this smell
No more hours of making out, why couldn't I've just have gone to Hell
Sex used to be so good and so was hanging out
Now your obviously sickened by me and I'm starting to doubt your love is true
Even though I'm dead I missed you every day
But my skin is rotting off my body I'm starting to decay
And I can see that you don't see the sparkle on my face
And I notice that you notice that my heart is out of place
So you're upset and you're crying and you're walking out the door

No one is wrong and no one's right
I'm in the ring but I don't want to fight
I wanna know, are you doing well?
'cause baby from this distance it's hard to tell
I wanna know, did you let it go?
'cause I can't stop my mind from doin' prison time
I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know",Indie

Yo I'm hoping out a Phantom with a' iced out medallion
Stallions on both arms, rocks on both charms
My Dominican chick looking like Scarface sister
Red and curly and she wake me up early
Cause hustlers hit the block when police change shifts
New York, California different toilet, same shit
In Brooklyn I rock Timberlands
Still toast cinnamon
Been gangster way before he dropped many men
Liquor in my system, voice raspy who I sound like?
Don't ask me that's my nigga we classy
Him and Montega Jada our style superior to haters
You can catch me in the latest Marvin Gaters
Ralph Lauren suit tape it up fly cause I'm papered up
Why these niggas keep hating on my Phantom
I be out in Atlanta and body tapping I'm probably strapped
Toast it up niggas

All my hoods on the real dark side of the track
No sunny sky's just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live
No playing around here, Lord let us live
Don't hate my hood just hate my shine
We coming out we on our grind
We live real down here, Lord let us live
We coming outta here, Lord let us live

Now who the fuck want war with the human gun store?
Gangsta rap is where I live just knock on the front door
Niggas stunt more than Jackie Chan
What the fuck them faggots saying?
Nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand
Take 'em back to '94 shooing out a Astro van
Banging was the blueprint money was the master plan
Duffel bag full of Grants and Franklins
Rob niggas take they money shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up
Fuck niggas in Black Wall Street I trust
Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money nigga get paid quick
And don't save shit

Lord knows that money don't matter
Lord knows that status is badder
Lord knows about the hood I live in
He's taking away but he's giving
Now don't give me these cars
Don't give me these mansions
Don't hate me just let me ride, Lord just give me light

I don't hate Mobb Deep or M.O.P
That was a phase I was caught up in the beef like a rat in a maze
And my legacy will never be that of a hater
Lyrical rhyme slayer wack niggas say your prayers
It's the return of Gandhi
Criminal minded city behind me
Put it on my face to remind me
Of all the shit I been through my physical presence, my pen too nice
My first album sent you life
I should of put down the mic when Rakim left Dre
No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base
I had to steal third motherfucker that's my word
There's some Queens niggas try to put me back on the curb
I was ultimate warrior to you bully ass niggas
I will come through the hood with the fully axe niggas
Like Snoop or Suge I'm in the coupe I'm good
Mothafuckas make way

"I see that look in your eyes, girl,
I might cross the room, that you're leading,
And I can't deny that I want you.
So I make my way up to you,
No, I see that ring on your finger.
Telling me that I shouldn't linger.
It's such a shame, a disaster,
That it has to be this way,
But if it was cool.
It would be me and you.
Think of all the nasty things we could do.
That would something, but only,
""If"" it was cool, but it ain't though,
Tell me, would he mind,
If I kissed ya,
Now he's at home, watching E-S-P-N
If I took you home, would he miss you?
But it don't' matter, 'cause I don't get down that way.
No, if you were mine, would you do this to me?
While I'm at home, watching reruns of Drag
Net with a bottle of Hennesey.
Would you be ashamed when you saw,
And what would you say?
But if it was cool.
It would be me and you.
Think of all the nasty things we could do.
That would something, but only,
""If"" it was cool, but it ain't though,
Whoa, so nice to meet,
Oh, I try to teach you the best I could,
Like a true gentleman should.
Girl, I've gots to meet to him,
He right there, might just see it,
I'll be around, same bat time, same bat channel,
You know the station, whoa.
But if it was cool.
It would be me and you.
Think of all the nasty things we could do.
That would something, but only,
""If"" it was cool, but it ain't though,
If it was cool.
If it was cool.
If it was cool.
That would something, but only,
""If"" it was cool, but it ain't though,
We meet and everything was fine,
We were so young, everybody drove a Mercedes,
We got, so high, so low, wasn't so long ago,
We coulda fell in love, but your girl got in the mix,
Made you sick, drove you crazy,
Then one day came out your face with a pack of lies.
When other people get into your business,
They should really shut the hell up and take five,
And now you're sorry, you say baby I'm sorry.
I might be able to forgive you and forget, but I dunno yet.",R&B
"If you and I were meant to be
You wouldn't test my sanity
Corrective lenses in my brain
Twist my thoughts so I can see
It's all about who's wrong or right
To see who's words have got more bite
1,000 ways to kill the light
Frustration taking over
Too many pictures all at once
Too many shadows in the rain
And I see a crack up in the sun
Calling out your name
It's everything
Everything you wanted
But if what we had got lost along the way
It's everything
Everything you needed
And I'm reaching out
For all the things we lost along the way
Should I turn and walk away
When other paths may lie ahead
Too many feelings in my heart
Try to search for what you said
I try to be in tune with you
I try to symbolize your dreams
You wouldn't let me take you there
Frustration taking over
Too many pictures all at once
Too many shadows in the rain
And I see a crack up in the sun
Calling out your name
It's everything
Everything you wanted
But if what we had got lost along the way
It's everything
Everything you needed
And I'm reaching out
For all the things we lost along the way
Too many pictures all at once
Too many shadows in the rain
And I see a crack up in the sun
Someone calling out your name
I can't believe in everything
I can't foresee where I begin
And there's nothing left to understand
And so I just give in
It's everything
Everything you wanted
But it's what we had
Got lost along the way
It's everything
Everything you needed
And I'm reaching out
For all the things we lost along the way
It?s everything
Everything you wanted

Got lost along the way
It's everything
Everything you needed

"Yeah I see you over there makin' eyes at me
Like you don't wanna get caught
Where'd you get the cowboy on your arm
And where you want me to drop him off
I see you tryin' to hide that fire inside
But your hold me back's almost gone
Yeah it's about time I let cowboy know
That I'm a gonna take you home
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can tell you what I got here on my mind
But I think you already know
Yeah and now's the time for you to turn around
If you want me to walk away
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
Yeah I can tell by the way I took your hand
And then asked you to dance
He went all John Wayne in front of his friends
And said I don't think so man
Yeah all blowed up like a loud mouth pup
Never been in a junkyard fight
But if you're gonna bark at the big dog boy
Then you're gonna get to feel the bite
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can tell you what I got here on my mind
But I think you already know
Yeah and now's the time for you to turn around
If you want me to walk away
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can finish sweepin' her off her pretty little feet
And your buddies can carry you home
You can back off and let her dance with me
And live to fight another day
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
Yeah I love the way the sun's comin' through
And bouncin' off the small of your back
Yeah I know if I call in sick today
Boss man will have a heart attack
Yeah I knew it was over when she rolled over
And said baby why don't you stay
And keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
And keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that,
Lookin' at me that, lookin' at me that way",Country
"One, two, three, four
Oh, somewhere down the road, there's a ditch where there's a hole
Which marks the spot where you will lie when you are cold
And you can run, you can hide, you can bitch and you can whine
But you will never save your life
When you meet death
Be out of breath
And say you're pleased to see him 'cause you're tired
Now you can go down with the wreck or you can scurry from the deck
But there's no way to save your skinny little neck
And you can pray to who you please, and you can fall down on your knees
But your feet will still get wet
When you meet death
Be out of breath
And say you're pleased to see him 'cause you're tired
Of wondering how much time you've got left
Of worrying that you're no good at chess
It's your funeral anyway
Choose your game
Then let's play
When you meet death
Be out of breath
And say you're pleased to see him
In fact you're waiting for this meeting
And quite frankly his timekeeping leaves a lot to be desired
So tell that  bastard that he's fired",Indie
"As the door over left behind to
Stand wide open for us to see
There is one thing in life I told you
I can see you but you can't see me, yeah
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way it is
As my Father up in heaven above
Shining star that is full of love
And He is a big surprise that just open your hearts
And if that's one thing that I'm mighty proud of
You see now
There are sometimes when you make me happy
There are sometimes when you make me sad
But that's a part of life give it what you have
To all I ask is forget the bad
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way it is
All your smiles and your all your lies won't
Oh, erase the pain inside, yeah
Hold your self and your serenity
'Cause I can see you this evening
And can't you see me, well?
That's the way, that's the way it is, yeah
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way, let me say that's the way it is
That's the way
And you must believe all the things I tell you
You won't believe all the words I say
Now one little thing in life I'm rest assured of
Heavenly father's gonna make a way in 
I will, yeah, I wanna clap my hands
Wanna clap my hands
Let me, let me clap my hands",R&B
"The vulgar eyes of a mindless Crime
Are looking at you till the end of time
Your mind is filled with hate
You are your own slave, can't escape
When you're all alone you feel the same old pain
in your brain falls a deadly rain
You have no choice, you've to play game with
The mothafuckin' death is the only exit
To kill somebody
it's not worth the money
To kill somebody
it's not worth the trouble
Lobotomy they are not on your side
Chemical will change your mind
When they get you it means your death
Your freedom is a weapon, don't forget
It was just a minute, the pain lasts forever
The last smile of the death, you won't forget it never
deep in your souls resounds the silent scream
You'll see the dirty blood in your every dream",Metal
"I sparkle,
Loving the way that I do
 I feel so good
Just having you
Breathlessly and Eager
Submission isn't easy for me

I always known it could be
Don't want to do nothing
Tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill
You got to know just how it feel
And if you think your going to fall
All you have to do is call
I have nothing in my self
And I give my self to you
Say child tingle sparkle
I hope the love never breaks away
Keep the fire burning everyday
Save all the warmth for you
Just want you to know
When your jealousy shows
Understand there will be no other man
But you baby
You can believe
This love in me
As I believe in you",R&B
"You may find her in a tavern in the cheap part of town
With bright lights and music and a crowd gathered round
It may be too late now to tell her but I love her more today
But I didn't lose her I threw her away
She stood by me looked for the good in me when she knew I was wrong
I would love her just enough to keep her hanging on
She stayed much longer than she should then she walked out one day
But I didn't lose her I threw her away
She only wanted me to love her and to tell her so each day
Now she's somewhere in a tavern wasting her life away
But don't be too fast to condemn her for what she might do or say
For I didn't lose her I threw her away",Rock
"Who can tell just how it starts
Angry words and broken hearts
Till silently we sit apart
You and I
But in awhile the anger's gone
And we forget who's right or wrong
Then one of us will end it all
With just a smile
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe happy endings
You and I
Just a word is all it takes
And so it pass
The silence breaks
And looking back it makes us ache
For what we've done
And so we cling together now
And wonder why we're oh so proud
When all that matters anyhow
Is our love
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings

I smoke and get high like Project Pat
Leave a nigga in the trap like a project rat
You wanna fuck with my money bust a hole through ya hat
And leave you rotting in the sewer, you the water on tap
Cause me and my bitches don't play no more
Bum rush a nigga while he picks the juice at the store
Get him for his Christian Diors and Mauri gators
Niggas called the cops so we said ""Come in, chase us""
Jesting every fucking skater for his skateboard
Wearing BBC denim, nigga, I'mma take yours
I'mma shake floors in my dry denim jeans
Black tee, black hair, and my lip gloss clean
I move like scene when I dip across the abstract
Got makeup leave the ticket on the dash
I'm looking for the cash cause I'm tryna' cop the double-trunks
Boys act stupid so you know I've got to double-bump

You're a woman like no other
You lift me when I'm down and blue
You make me care for you every day
There's no other in my life but you
Yeah, yeah

You like the way Sevens stay up on my hip
But the nigga don't never got something in they clip
Grip-grip got the chrome zip aimed at your lip
Never seen a young bitch pop like this
Yup, and the niggas really like this
Nameplate in the middle of my nice tits
Diesel and I'm higher than your flight is
On Verde day y'all playin' where the kites is
Stay steamin' where the sites is
Y'all bitches still gleaming at the prices
See through females like a psychic
She's mad cause her man wanna pipe this
She could fuck around and get chopped into slices
Body parts in the gutter where the crap dice is
And that one'll be a cold case
They found her head, it was missing her whole face
See I'm a scratched CD, I really don't play
And I reach for the tech and spray
I spray just like Air Wick and Glade
But you won't smell white lilies and sage
Wow this little girl sounds insane
I've been listening to Wayne and piffing up the brain
Long black weave and a few gold chains
Semi-automatic and some real good brain


I spit heavy on the beat like I'm tryna' get the taste out
Them other niggas on it like they got the cake mouth
Seventeen, been hot since I came out
Got every whack rapper shaking like a change pouch
I make out then I send a nigga's face off
Then to the left, boy you gotta break out
Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you
And the fifth will leave pool on the floor with you

Fuck love I keep a couple tricks up my sleeve
So when one leaves another nigga's in the elevator
So take the stairs, not the elevator

Well baby now that you've got your freedom how you're doin'

And said that you didn't want to live with me anymore

Yeah I thought we'd both be better off if we just untight the knot

But honey I was in your arms five minutes before I knew I made a big mistake

"I stand here by the Western Wall
Maybe a little of that wall stands inside us all
I shove my prayers in the crack
I've got nothing to lose, no one to answer back
All these years I've brought up for review
Wasn't taught this but I learned something new
And to answer the distant call
At the Western Wall
I've got a heart full of fear
And I offer it up on this altar of tears
Red dust settles deep in my skin
I don't know where it starts and where I begin
It's a crumbling pile of broken stones
It ain't much but it might be home

It's the Western Wall

You can murder the rebel

You can't murder the rebellion

I'm hoping things will fall my way


I don't wanna feel no pain, no pain

Ooh
If you need me tonight

If you need me tonight

If you need me tonight

If you need me tonight

If you need me tonight
Need me tonight
Need me tonight
Alright
If you need me
If you want me
Come on now
I feel like I'm hanging
Like I'm a puppet on a string
Ting-a-ling-a-ling-ling
Which way am I turning?
So bu ba da back make me kick my rap
'Coz I'm kicking it, kicking it bad
When I'm rapping on a vocal track
Do you know how I'm feeling
I never really knew
It was my heart you were stealing
So why put up a fight?
If you know very well that you need me tonight
Need me, need me

If you need me tonight
If you need me tonight

If you
Need me
Want me
Need me
Want me
Be here
I'll be here for you
I still love you, want you
I don't know how
I don't know how I feel for you",Metal

This is a federal food fight

That means we're callin out all you kooks and crooks

Oh, me? My name is Humpty Hump

I'm the original big-nosed rapper, baby

We're about to sling hot food all over this piece

Here we go, back in the house for the 9-whatever

With the bacon and egg sandwich

You ain't bringing groceries, g
Your groove is getting rude over records
But can you sling the food like this?!
You better bite this
If you want to make the people move like this
Chez wa, Allah, cheese burger
Flame broil base, my pickle make ya wiggle
You're busted, my mustard will wax your whole plate
By itself, not including all my funky condiments
Nod your head to this and DUCK DOWN
As I commence to lock and load a fresh cantaloupe
Yo, I'm illin! I'm slingin melons
Like the felons are slangin dope sacks
So max but I wouldn't stand so close up in the light
Either bring it or hide
Cause it's about to be a food fight!


We hit you in the neck with a cheeseburger

Yeah, bruh, we hit you in the neck with a cheeseburger!

It's classic
Slapping brothers with some lettuce from jurasstic
I counteract it with the Shock with ham hocks
From brothers who might Tupac
Fifty-seven black  and lots of flows
Fat like hippopotamoes, still caught em though
In the face with excrements, peep my testaments
I bring the seasoning paprika
Eureka for the weaker, and smoke the reefer
Dribble up the funk in the beaker
And, yes, about to say ?speaker'
It leaks in your ears and years ahead
I went to Japan and they was throwing pork balls
But I'm calling protocol, stooop!


We banked you in the neck with the cheeseburger

Yes, we're slugging the chicken nugget to your grill

Get ready, we're coming fetti with the groceries

Someone shoulda told ya, it ain't over till it's over

Now if I am what I eat I hope I ain't a big couchie
Gotta substitute the ?ouch' for the ?ooch'!
If so, I hate to see my man Donnie O, he'd be a butthell
Substitute the ?ell' for the ?ole'
Actually, factually hella fools I know would be toe up
If you was what you ate, no fakin
My man Nate would be a plate of bacon
My brother Shock popcorn, and my cat would be a rat
My girlfriend would be some super sperm and things
My rich nigga Pac would be a lobster with hot wings
It's quite simple, if true that my temple is wrecked
I'd be some mushrooms and cognac
I'd be a pinto bean gravy smothered neck bone
Scrilla taker, vanilla wafer, baker, filler
So come on with your food slingin cause I'm ready
Bring it Â­ SHUT UP! Nigga, sing it

Bring the groceries",Hip-Hop

You can smell the residue and the fumes from next do'
Ughhh, turf superstar, microwaves and pickle jars
Portable digital scales, custom painted muscle cars
Pimpin where the razor blade? Use a safety pin
What they goin fo'? Nigga what you tryin to spend?
When it's a drought I just sit on my dope and wait
For the prices to skyrocket and rise like real estate
I got that ice cream, that candy, that girl, that white white white
My car's a Charger 2006 Hemme, tight tight tight
I'm a d-boy, BOOTCH, I thought you knew

Bundle in the bushes, chopper up in the tree
AK'll light up your chest like E.T.

Might make your nose bleed, if it's potent
So if you're not ready, homey don't tamper with it
She the chick who had Tony Montana slippin
She so bad she make you mad
But soon as you get mad, she make you cash
That white girl, but she ain't always that light
She ain't always that bright, she ain't always that white
Nope; gimme one girl, I mean one gram

Put it in that pot, 'til it get that hot
Then start to Sir Mix-A-Lot

But nothin bring the bread back like a caucausian
Whether, winter fall, summer or spring
A white girl's always down for doin the damn thing 
Put her on the highway, she ain't no punk
Got a white girl drivin with white girls in the trunk 
I ain't lyin, it's the best thing goin
When my white girl's around, it's always snowin
Momma cain't stand her, tellin me to switch
Sayin I'ma go to jail fuckin with that white bitch 
Always around to keep me paid

No question marks or commas, nigga we got the scarma
When we through with this batch, we goin out to the Bahamas
I keep them stiff broads when I'm fuckin with the hogs
Cause they never get stopped by the motherfuckin cops
Bootch look hard but the bitch is a fraud
Don't like to see me ball, want me to go rock a rock
Move around bitch, you need to get out the way
I keep a young Suzy when it's time to move yay
You need to learn the game befo' you try to play

"you preach with such conviction
but your life mirrors contradiction
daddy foots the bills
as you live a life of priveleged frills
buying hair dye with mommy's visa card
yet you bitch that life is so hard
with a punker-than-thou attitude
you hide behind a facade to elude

You're a simple book to read
with your transparent creed
Your facade recedes
to your front-we do heed.
sent to an ivy league school
only to come out a corporate fool
one day sporting daddy's benz
next day your politi-punk stance condescends
your opinions are ineffectual
you're a phoney pseudo-intellectual
out to prove yourself with verbal affrays
but your prescence here is just a phase

you make attempts to theorize
with motives contrived to criticize
you'll find ways to falsly justify your guise
to explain to yourself your lies
you'll be gone in two years-an accurate prediction
and elsewhere you'll live out a life of fiction
family money affords your fleeting radical views
but nothing can buy you true virtues

"And every soldier's face is burnt,
and it's a mask or it's a flash.
And their hands are turned to rifles now,
and they kill everything and anything they touch.
So watch the trees swaying in the breeze,
keeping beat to the butchery.
And every subway station's wrecked,
it shuts down and off.
And business men in a panic: ""Here they come! Here they come!""
And they collect power killing love.
So watch the bat,
a picnic death camp.
Keeping beat to the butchery.
So children come burn the skyscapers
and the cities alive.
Come clean within you.
And the metronome clicks like new,
and the metronome clicks over our skulls.
And every single window pane is smashed,
and every compass smiling broken glass.
Here's a place where the soldiers came,
to rake up all that they could take.
So toss another bottle,
pull another pin.
Light up the sky in a butchery.

"I just want the world to know - You've got me at an all time low.
But I wrote the song that broke your fucking heart.
I'm caught up in 'no sleep' and I nod my head with every tear but they're still drowning me.
It's cold and I can barely see, and 5 AM is here again so hang your head with me.
I was walking next to you in a saturday night-type light.
The faces blurred in with yours as I stumbled some words on life...
I was breathing thanks to you in a saturday night-type light.
And when the faceless kids danced towards faceless ends I quit life.
""I can't believe that you're not dead""
shrugged my shoulders, laughed inside, nodded my head.
And I don't remember anything but seven songs of chances gone, that's all I know.
Anytime you want to go, I'm ready to go.
Nothing shines on ""feeling old"" this isn't right.
All I want is a reason to smile before I'm dead, I'm dead, I live in denial.
There's nothing left inside of me.
You say there's more but I don't fucking care.",R&B

Suspended and waiting for some light to turn on
I'm reaching up to make contact
Take away this empty space
I'm so tired of just drifting through the Milky Way

I'm ready to be the one
That burns for You tonight
So bring me to life

From falling out of sight
And you can wage this war of one

"Yeah,
Sometimes I feel like I'm climbing to the top of a broken ladder.
Serving up Silver on a Golden platter.
Pitching a fastball to an absent batter,
And cleaning off glass that's already shattered.
Pitting myself up against the hatred and laughter,
People telling me that I'm not a ""real rapper"".
Tellin myself that what you think about me don't matter.
Because these ain't your dreams, I'm chasing after.
I'm just looking for purpose, some meaning or fate,
Wondering why every single dream that I've chased,
Came close enough to taste but then, slipped away.
I found my meaning in the simplest of things.
I put the tip of a pen to my paper and my brain grew wings.
I found that I love this feeling, and all the things that it brings,
I found my calling in a room full of beaten down dreams.
Space stations they're disguising as stars,
Choose to be a light in a world full of dark.
I thought I loved a girl but realized that we're better apart,
But at that moment didn't know if it was my brain or my heart.
My soul is here for you to take it or leave it,
I see by the look on your face I know that you can barely believe it.
You thought you knew me before I started making all this music,
I knew I wouldn't be an artist until the moment I choose it.
How come we're all afraid of our own flaws?
People tell me the world's just dogs eating dogs,
Trust me, my man, you don't want none of these jaws,
I'll bite ya face off and then I'll pause for applause.
It's hard to find meaning, that's what I know.
How's a girl supposed to feel worth something when y'all calling her a hoe to her face,
Just so you feel better about yo own mistakes.
Wondering you look in the mirror and see someone fake.
So say what you want, just know that I stopped listening.
At the end of the day, I know that I won't be missing ya.
In fact,
why am I wasting these lines even taking the time to write about someone like you?
I don't know.
I may be different.
And you may not like it.
But imma stay this way.
Even despite the way you say that I been changing lately feeling like you're out the loop
but the loop is full of lack of truth the things you hear aren't who I am,
that's why I write.
To take a stand to show you all that I'm the man!
Now it's time you play your hand let's run it back, to where it all began.
I don't remember.
Was it in July or some cloudy November or September?
If there's one thing that I wish it's that I could be a better son,
A better brother to my sisters better in all that I've done.
If you're listening just know that my times just begun
It's funny how you can be freezing standing right beneath the Sun.
Have you ever had so much to say that you spend all day wondering if you should stay or if you should go your way?
Cause I have.
I found my meaning in the simplest of things.
I put the tip of a pen to my paper and my brain grew wings
I found that I love this feeling, and all the things that it brings,
I found my calling in a room full of beaten down dreams.
You're staring like I'm wearing all my clothes inside out.
If only you would've given me the benefit of the doubt.
I doubted myself first and look what I've found.
I don't need drugs to get high when I float right off of the ground.
I don't look down anymore, I'm not afraid to fall.
I got a focus so hard boy, call me Adderall.
She knows that I love her, I know that's why she never calls.
You fighting some petty shit, I'm fighting for a different cause.
I started discovering myself as I grew much older.
Found that over time it feels like my heart grew colder.
I remember the first time, you cried in my shoulder.
It felt like the time around me started going much slower.
I found my purpose deep within myself.
I realized that if was a book I'd be way up on the third shelf,
Slowly rotting away, but then one fateful day,
I picked up a pen and started writing my story, my way.
Now I can't stop writing, like I've found my true calling.
Planted my feet down realized that I've been free falling.
All the time that I wasn't creating, I was just stalling.
If my life's gonna be a fight I'm gonna be out here brawling.
It's gonna be a journey, but I don't feel nervous.
I've spent way too much of my life feeling worthless.
It's up to me to find my own living purpose.
With every rhyme I write I know I'm just scratching the surface.",Hip-Hop

"The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgivable
I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown on the grown?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Leaving in the car and much be spent on television
Oh girlfriend, get your mind on right
Don't spend your time 'cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last but you must feed the mind
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
Love, you feel it and you got to let them know it
Love, your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
'Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, no, no, no

Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals
Before she reaches the light
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got
And other times it makes you pay
Well, when you finally rise
Then you'll realize
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes
Oh you could wish on the stars but they dead, just a lie

Ha ha yeah check it out money & pussy make the world go 'round
 That's how it's been since the beginning of time.
Now who says we can't be fly?
Who say Compton niggas can't get they scrilla
At the same time get some thigh
Well uh that's the subject of my conversation
Cause ain't nothin' like gettin' a dollar & some penetration
Now that's a whole lot easier to understand now a days
But uh some of you playas still be going out sideways
So umm just take this game with a tic tac
Cause if you was on Skid Row you can get
Pussy faster than a Big Mac
I owe it to myself to be fly that's what Top Dog taught a boy
Cause instead of Mounds these bitches always want Almond Joy
Because uhh ""Sometimes they feel like a nut""
But they rather have it more often than they don't
So I won't go flippin' & makin' it topsy turvy
Now keep my hundred dollar bills crisp & that ass curvy
Cause ain't nuthin' on my mind but to be fly through time
Havin' a nest egg bird behind an estate that's mine
Watchin' Jordan go for forty in a sucker tub
Eatin' Cheetos drinkin' Mo' & getting a back scrub
Because first you get the power then you get the money
Then you get the pussy dude don't be no dummy uhh
Chorus El Debarge:
Playas get they paper when they game is tight
And if you want some nana that's for you to decide
But as long as you ain't simpin' then ya doin' it right
'cause together they go hand in hand Oh yeah


She want to make me break code but I can't
I want to fire it up & hit it pass it like dank
Baby all in my square big buddha long hair
Fly Chinese & Black for a mack plus player
D baby I'ma get ya hot want to get ya full blown
So we all can hit the spot 
Got game by the tons lookin' for some 2nd II None
Kinda fun but these hookers on the run for cover
They lookin' for lovers ain't no trickin' young D
'cause I'm unlike the others not a buster
I'm on the mission for figures time up for you diggers
 Pass the liquor
Hoes hear the name it get's 'em hotter
Spin a scraggler on a wheel now they call me D the Potter
Lotta hatin' going on but I ain't with it
I'ma mash on that drama everytime that I feel it
'Cause I'd rather have a major end than have sex
And when I have a million to splurge you know what's next
But first you get the power then you get the money
Then you get the pussy fool don't be no dummy


El Debarge talking:
Yeah first comes the power then the money heh
And if you really just want it the
Na na na na la di da na na na la di da

I understand that you think you grown
Independent on ya own with ya jazzy ways
My intent is ya lay but first I'm out to get paid not played
Can't be yo' incredible edible egg
I don't crack nor split my yolk with the female folk
Now baby break yourself get broke you can choke
Off this young black better than Mary Jane
In ya brain I'm guaranteed to have ya thinkin' & feelin' thangs
Like yourself now uhh watch ya health if ya feel like plottin'
Ya body turns rotten from the inside out that pussy's turned out
Getting hit by a sucker a 2 minute brother
Who's first 10 seconds is thinkin' he came up
That next full minute suckin ya drama up
50 seconds to go see half of that is the show
Now where the other half you can't laugh
'cause you know it's straight simpin' & whinin'
'stead of pimpin' & grindin' KK'll let you know
So pay attention bro
See first you get the power then you get the money
Then you get the pussy don't be the dummy though

All the things I never really meant
Take me back

I promise to forget
You're plastic and on my shelf
Let's fake romance
And I'll be someone else
Don't even touch me
My hands are cold as ice
And as a toy soldier in my life
Have nothing left to give
And all this fighting hurts
The more I yell at you
The less you seem to learn
No, no, no, no, no I take it back
All I've ever said
All the things I never really meant
Take me back I want my toy soldier

"Say a prayer for the cowboy
His mare's run away
And he'll walk til he finds her
His darling, his stray
But the river's in flood
And the roads are awash
And the bridges break up
In the panic of loss.
And there's nothing to follow
There's nowhere to go
She's gone like the summer
Gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking
His heart with their song
As the day caves in
And the night is all wrong
Did he dream, was it she
Who went galloping past
And bent down the fern
Broke open the grass
And printed the mud with
The iron and the gold
That he nailed to her feet
When he was the lord
And although she goes grazing
A minute away
He tracks her all night
He tracks her all day
Oh blind to her presence
Except to compare
His injury here
With her punishment there
Then at home on a branch
In the highest tree
A songbird sings out
So suddenly
Ah the sun is warm
And the soft winds ride
On the willow trees
By the river side
Oh the world is sweet
The world is wide
And she's there where
The light and the darkness divide
And the steam's coming off her
She's huge and she's shy
And she steps on the moon
When she paws at the sky
And she comes to his hand
But she's not really tame
She longs to be lost
He longs for the same
And she'll bolt and she'll plunge
Through the first open pass
To roll and to feed
In the sweet mountain grass
Or she'll make a break
For the high plateau
Where there's nothing above
And there's nothing below
And it's time for the burden
It's time for the whip
Will she walk through the flame
Can he shoot from the hip
So he binds himself
To the galloping mare
And she binds herself
To the rider there
And there is no space
But there's left and right
And there is no time
But there's day and night
And he leans on her neck
And he whispers low
""Whither thou goest
I will go""
And they turn as one
And they head for the plain
No need for the whip
Ah, no need for the rein
Now the clasp of this union
Who fastens it tight?
Who snaps it asunder
The very next night
Some say the rider
Some say the mare
Or that love's like the smoke
Beyond all repair
But my darling says
""Leonard, just let it go by
That old silhouette
On the great western sky""
So I pick out a tune
And they move right along
And they're gone like the smoke
And they're gone like this song",Rock

"I got two sides of me
You can bet they're enemies
You got the good side then you got the madness

Oh lean, mean and green

And you feel like you have lost control
It's not a test you're dealing with the madness
Don't be scared by what you find
It's guaranteed to blow your mind
I must confess I really like the madness
I lost my sanity
You can rest when they bury me
From the west side staying alive with the madness
Take look into my eyes and see a fucked up state of mind
My crime is losing time to the madness
Oh and I'm filled with steam
Oh lean, mean and green
Oh but I still believe

When your thoughts are not your own
And you feel like you have lost control

It's guaranteed to blow your mind
I must confess I really like the madness
Break it down
Don't steal my soul

Just a full time hard time headed straight for the madness
Can't you see I've had it?

And you feel like you have lost control

Someday she's gonna have it if I live that long if God give me the time

And I love her
The day when our first baby came we both cried and felt the pain together
I passed around the cheap cigars and braged a lot about our newborn daughter
Now she's growing up and she's a sweet and loving image of her mother
Who gives me strenght to make each day and says I know you'll find the way
And I love her
When the world is walked away she's the one who always stays beside me
Giving all the love she can reaching out with gentle hands to guide me
In another month or two we hope to give our little girl a brother
Without her I could never be the kind of man she sees in me

now oh me, and oh my, give me a piece of that pie
only worryin bout when, not concerned with why
we hit the door, she embraces me and touches my face
starts darting towards the room, now im joinin the chase
lay her down real soft and as im kissing her ear
i hear a noise in the room, but it wasnt that clear
knob turns, it swings open and to my surprise
her man's standing over me with a gleam in his eye

Had every toy that money could buy

pulled out my dick, put her mouth on it
told her get on it, hopped on top,

I flipped her over, to beat her from the back,

I pulled my boat up from the sea
I hid my sails away,
I hung my nets on a greenwood tree
And I scanned the moonlit bay.
The boys were out, and the Redcoats too,
I kissed my wife goodbye;
And in the shade of the greenwood glade
I followed Henry Joy. ""

He tore our ranks with ball,
But with a cheer and a pike to clear
We swept them o'er the wall.

We won, but lost, ah, why?
No matter lads, I fought beside
And shielded Henry Joy.
Ah, boys, for Ireland's cause we fought;
For her and home we bled,
Though our pikes were few still our hearts beat true,
And five to one lay dead,
And many a lassie mourned her lad,
And mother mourned her boy;

Something melted inside when the tones hit my pulse
And stifled the idle eagerness to grow into my clothes
No one that I know is any longer good at actin'
Like they comprehend the motive uncoated to feed the corroded passion
Actually needs to stay eye level with the rest
That's the least I deserve for the love that I've shed
I've trudged through the sediment in search of the rhythm
Dove soul first to bathe nude in its abyss
Paid dues and made music my religion
Now I listen, close my eyes, and forget I even exist
I sing a bastard's tune, inspired by the noise
The ship made before it sank and was finally destroyed
I flaunt the grin of a man made for disguising a boy
Who tried to avoid showing the cry in his voice
But there's something special about the notes that he hears
Those scales are redemption, unraveling repressed memories
And when he breathes, a new energy enters and consumes him
To heal his wounds and unseal his doom
If only I could make you understand
But words are just words so I can't
The universe's deepest art form keeps my heart warm with influence

Ain't nothing quite as beautiful as Music
To be an angel, you gotta earn your wings
To control your own, you gotta burn your strings
To hit blackjack, you gotta turn a king
But to live forever, all you gotta do is learn to sing
I get a pleasure that's inevitably immeasurable
And I won't let it be rejected by no man
Why does it have to be so damn difficult
To live in the frame of a game that will slit your throat?
But I've dug in the mud in search of the drum
Dove soul first to bathe nude in its abyss
Stayed true to the music, now my favorite thing to do is
Close my eyes and forget that I even exist
I hold this fistful of degenerate ideas
For every genius that was murdered in the name of Jesus
Still deaf to the bells that claimed to free us
But I pay homage to my melody 'cause she's the sweetest
The core of our spirit is naked
The form of its lyrics are sacred
Blanketed by the original sound of the inner vibrations
I'm floating on the soft clouds of positive creation
See, I can look at a painting and admire the colors
Or appreciate any type of art that I discover
But what I dig's invisible

I miss you so upon my knees I bend
And pray someday you'll want me back again
And pray someday you'll want me back again
I pray someday you'll love me once again",R&B
"Two steps ahead of myself following you blindly
Set my faith on fire but the real Larsen  was bad timing
Walking through walls never seemed so uninteresting
You make magic mundane when you put the suicide in sexy
IV upon request Im finally walking on my own
Mama was a coma; Papa was a rolling kidney stone
Send me home with enough thread to keep my wounds closed
Here Lies the Truth was tattooed on the tombstone
The wounds tore, leaking worms out of its newborn scorn
Your perfume performs plastic poetry on my human form
Warm bacteria glowin in the dark, flash cooks the psyche
All Mikey ever wanted was Oliver Hart 
Ill go for a short walk in the long run
When the spores spread to the lungs
Its all nails to the tongue
Failed to accept it all comes to pass
Fight me slow, fuck me fast
Youre still my friend take off the mask
When I heard Ive got this perfect little medicine
Bright enough to blind the sun, it makes my itches interesting
Im a slave, youre a story, but your bravery is boring
Lick your lips, point em at my heart, and cut it open for me
If this was heaven it would have a better backstage
The director keeps pressuring me to act my age
Maybe shes right
If I could squeeze a bit of life out of this empty page
In the book of love maybe Ill push and shove my way
Through this rainy day, changes in my brain made the chains decay
My prescription angel, come and take my pain away
Play your guitar, try to sing out my cough
Found a treasure chest of pleasure, excess marks the spot
Screw in the screws tighter, clip the loose wires
I was truly inspired til my muse told me shes too tired
I had to come and pull the label, didnt read the warning
running, running, running, running, running can be habit forming
When I heard Ive got this perfect little medicine
Bright enough to blind the sun, it makes my itches interesting
Im a slave, youre a story, but your bravery is boring
Lick your lips, point em at my heart, and cut it open for me",Hip-Hop
"If I can see it and that's when I'm like about anything
If I can see it, I can do it
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I could fly
I believe I can touch the sky
Think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe, I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence, it can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
If I can see it, I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I could fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
'Cause I believe in me
I believe in me
If I can see it then I can do it
If I just, if I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe, I believe I could fly
I believe I can touch the sky
Think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe, I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe, I believe
I believe I can fly and I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I know, I know I can fly
I know, I know I can soar
See me running through that open door

There's no other love
There's nobody else I'm thinking of
Only you baby you're special
How could I ever forget you
And let the moment slip away
We've been here for a while ha!
And I just wanna take you away

You got me doing things I never do
I can't stop feenin' and dreamin' about you oh
And about your love it feels so real to me

And you know just what to do 

What you got for me

Don't know what I'm gon' do 
You got me going
You got me going

I can't wait no longer

Moments turn into hours
And hours to days in my mind
Can someone tell me the time
I don't wanna wait in vain
And I don't wanna deal with the pain

You got me doin' things I never do
I can't stop feenin' and dreamin' about you oh whoa

For a moment so special

And I want you closer
I don't wanna let you go 
Just let me be 
Be all that you need 
You got that thing that I want and I'm ready

Ready to give you my love

"By day I sleep, at night I weep!
O Death, come near me!
Be the one for me, be the one who stays.
My rivers are frozen, and mischosen,
and the shadows around me sickens my heart.
O Death, come near me,
and stay . Hear my silent cry!
In sadness I'm veiled, to the cross I am nailed,
and the pain around me freezes my world.
My cold world...
In life I've failed,
for years I've wailed.
Frozen in time... left behind...
The rapture of grief is all to find...
The rapture of grief is all!
Behind the shadow of life the lost hopes are grieving.
I seek the night and hope to find love...
So I drown in the silence of lifes short eternity.
The tears fills the void in my heart astray...
Embrace me now, delightful ease!
Give me a world of wonderous peace!
Calm the desperate scream in my heart!
O Death, come near me,
save me from this empty, cold world!
O Life, you have killed me,
so spare me from this couldron of misery!
In life I cry, away I fly...
Chosen to fall within these walls.
The rapture...
The rapture of grief is all!
Oh, shed a tear for the loss of innocense,
for the forsaken spirits who aches... in us.
Cry for the heart who surrenders to pain,
for the solitude of those left behind!
Behold the pain and sorrow of the world,
dream of a place away from this nightmare.
Give us love and unity, under the heart of night.
O Death, come near us, and give us life!
I this world of pain I am better of dead!
Give me love, or give me... death!
O Death, come near me!
I have summoned you!",Metal
"If you see a magpie remember the rhyme
One for sorrow and two for joy
Three for a girl and four for a boy
Five for silver and six for gold
Seven for a secret never to be told
Wear a spider 'round your neck in a walnut shell
Keep a folded newspaper in your shoe
Stick the pages up with wallpaper glue
The devil has to read every word
Before he can get to you I've heard
May your soul get to Heaven
May your soul get to Heaven
Get to Heaven so the devil knows you're dead
Don't you let the robin in keep the white moth out
See the seventh son of the seventh son
If you need healing, well, he's the one
It never bodes well to see a dog cry
You dreamed of snow now your parents are gonna die
If she doesn't drop the scissors then she's been true
But don't part ways on a bridge, my friend
'Cause you'll never see each other again
And if you catch a sparrow on Valentine's Day
You'll marry poor but be happy anyway
May your soul get to Heaven
May your soul get to Heaven
Get to Heaven so the devil knows you're dead
Throw the windows up, move the birdcage out
If the doors are locked, his soul can't leave
Take all the buttons off his sleeve
Sew up his pockets and close his eyes
If you lived a good life there'll be flowers on your grave
And they'll keep one half of your comb
But don't ever try to follow them home
'Cause they don't want you there no more at all
May your soul get to Heaven
May your soul get to Heaven
Get to Heaven so the devil knows you're dead",Indie
"Hark the frozen chimes of winter
Crystal shimmer in your mind
To the first time when you saw her
You implored her to be kind
In the open fields around you
All before you gone to ground
Both the question and the answer
Deep inside you, you shall find
And while you're strollin'
Through the summer of your years
Enchanted, a garden overgrown
Don't call me sentimental
Those of you who care
Could find there a lover and a friend to the end
And if you're taken
By the spirit of your age
No reason to carve the cornerstone
Sway me, trade me
Your philosophy
First you're sowin', then you're growin'
Then you reap until you sleep
Will you scale the silver studded mountain?
Where contemplation will spring to mind
See the veiled prophet's withered gaze reflect the 'Nouvelle-vague'
Glazed visions imprisoned in your mind
Unwinding rivers flowing through the meadows to the sea
Paths of glory through shifting glades to fall
Present laughter and the memory of troubles you have seen
It is written in your mind",Rock

Welfare recipient, there's a reason why I'm seasoned

The projects, and the beat down, renovated apartment complexes
Smell me!
Uh, you in a new school whip
Custom painted candy apricot butter
I'm in an antique old school four do'
Muffler draggin beat up duster
With scrapes and scratches, nicks and scars
Y'all get to drink out of wine glasses
We gotta drink out of jelly jars
Down and out like four flat tires no washing machine nor dryer
Just a pillowcase sack and a bunch of clothes wrapped
In a sheet on our way to the laundrymat
Will I ever get paid, can I make a dollar out of fifteen cents?
Y'alls got it made, we broke and starvin' barely payin' the rent
Sleepless nights, alligator t-uh-tears
Mommy arguin wit' my daddy, daddy drunk too many beers
911 Mr Po-Po, dey ain't happy wit' day marriage
Pops tryna beat her down and make her have a miscarriage
My cousin shoots the needle, she be gone for days
She on that da-ah-diesel, she gone end up wit' AIDS
I told her I love her I swear I just told her
But you know what she said to me?
Everybody got a gay or at least one dopefiend in they family
You ain't the only one wit' a reject in yo' family
That's real

Seasoned and we, feel our paper won't disappear

The reason I'm musty is cause, we ain't got no mo' deodorant
The laughin' stock patna, we ain't got no cash
Feet stinkin through my shoes in PE class
I'm thriznew with biznein briznoke, I'm about to hiznit the griznind
And if I get popped it ain't half no more it's 80% percent of my time
But that's ah cha-ah-chance, that I'ma have to-ah-take
Today my son birthday and I can't even buy a cake
I'm so damn through-a-through, I had a JOB
You want me to cut my perm, oh y'all gone ave to fire me
My fellow just got out da joint, thought he might be okay
But my fellow got out and got stapled 26 times the same damn day
Who wanna get dunked on? In the the flatlands it ain't never too late
Patna all we need is a piece of plywood and a milk carton crate
What about dat shopping basket, you know I'm smart
We can gone take the wheels off that and ma-a-make a go cart
Yo peoples blessed you, I started from a quarter ounce
You came in the dope game wit' a silver spoon up in yo' mouth
Why we gotta gamble maine we hurtin', you got all the bucks
In the ghetto we play dominoes for push ups

You know, the trials and tribulations, you dig?
It's hard times out here y'know
Y'know we just tryin' to do our thing

Growin' up things was real hard for me
No food on the table, no clothes on my back

"Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws
Oh, I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lilly
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand
I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?
I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years
There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lillies of snow
I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea
And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now, it's all that there is

"Heh some of the harder shit
Peep this
Niggaz get vexed whenever I step in
Always want to flex so I got a weapon
Which protects ME and mine
Get too bold then you're seein nine milli
I rhyme silly but it really don't mean nothin
I seen thugs always want a mean mug so I bring slugs
to the party to reassure I be secure
Really don't know why they beefin for
I leave teeth in the floor like fossils I toss flows
Just to show you, what the boss knows
I got style, to make men hostile
I shall continue, then you still lost while
Challenging in physical combat
Show me the ringleader, and the wiz'll go bomb that
I come fat, you niggaz front runt cease
They say bigger punks fear but I don't hear what
they say I should, and when a hood try to steal my goods
Good! I want to show him that dreads can fly
heads I stood my ground there's snakes around
Schemin on the deep down but I defeat clowns
with intellect, then the next flex so I'm good to wreck
brains, it takes gall to brawl with minds in chains
Chorus: Del
It takes gall to brawl with minds in chains 
Verse Two:
This conflict is making John sick
But men want to fight over nothing, nonsense
is common, and common sense is none
Niggaz always want to grab your fists and run
I try to walk down MacArthur, and talk ta
pedestrians, who got the sacks to alter my mind
And find the right, one
Dug in the bushes, so I can get a tight one, it's fat
I got it, and now I need to be leavin
I believe men might get shady
Even if they know me
Just because we flow the oldie wants my dough
We all know where he can go
I'm not takin no shorts from you
And you ain't takin shit from me
I ain't no punk so I hit the G
I'm throwin one-hitter quitters to trap em
You know when I'm strapped, so I shoulda just mopped em
but nah, I'm not foolish, I keep a tool
with me, but that don't mean that I won't bust
a fool's lip, equipped be my adjectives
cause I had to live long
In slums where chums come at you wrong
And try to get you for all your cent
Unless you're not dipped you got your de-fenses on
They plot for your dough

"Lord, it's hard to do without a man in the house
Last night I needed a man so bad I couldn't sleep at all
I couldn't hardly wait for it to be morning
Then the kids would go to school
Then I'd roll over in bed and play a little game
If you had to have one man, just one man in your life, who would it be?
No, it wouldn't be the first one
And he was so surprised to find out that I
That I had never been before
And I wouldn't take Mr. Big Shot either
Huh, have another drink girl
But the one that I would wanna keep
I know who that would be
The one who first took me during my time that I was hurting
No I said, we gotta wait
But he touched me oh so gentle
Oh so gentle
He just relaxed me on
Now she's flowing he said
Beautiful, beautiful river
Beautiful, beautiful woman river
And I love him for that
Nobody could ever tell me anything bad about that man

Deep in the night
I remember
There I am reaching, for you
Wanting to turn to you
That's all I want
Oh so much
Deep in the night I need you
To touch me
Deep in the night
I wait for daylight
But daytime always gets blue
But when the sun
Goes down
That's when I feel cold
And old
Deep in the night I need you
To hold me
I read a book and I think about you
I put it down and I think about you
Make some coffee and I think about you
Watched at the cup and I think about you
Wind the clock and I think about you
Go to work and I think about you
I, watch my pillow
And I think
Yeah I think about you",R&B

Fire's turn, burning to the ground.

If you hate that heat
You think it's bad now, wait and see,
You think it's close now as you sleep within your bed.
Check out the fire
Check out the fire
Check out the fire overhead.
Children grow, playing with their toys
Acting out their fairytales in play
Children play, growing with the noise
Of television teaching them the way,
And while you're sometimes scared now
If you see the flames
You think the smoke's from far away,
You read the papers, saying the fire will not spread
Repeat CHORUS
Sweet the light, glowing neon blue
Of havens offering shelter from the storm
Sweet the sound, crackling in the grate
Of firelight, welcoming and warm
But if you think it's safe now,
If you feel at ease
Your safety's hanging from a thread
Before you're happy, having locked your doors at night

The power to fly, bird s eye view,climbing to

"Hivemind is scary, I feel vulnerable and stupid.
Waiting for a new embarrassment to go and tear right through me. A dependent fruitless animal, watch me brimming with shame.
This confidence I fake only makes matters worse. I am not a stallion, I am just perverse. Hopeless, and docile, and tamed.
Another day I won't remember, another day I wished away.
Tedious days punctuated by dismay, everyday feels the same.
It's the routine, and it's the regret.
That makes me worse yet.
Did I forget your name or make a joke and no-one laughed?
Did I come across as stupid or did I cum too fast?
This isn't a brave face, this is a mask.
Now I remember it doesn't take much to make me feel small",R&B
"Now I'm a dreamer
And I really feel that
Love is in the starts
A true believer love will overtake me
No matter where you are
And as I float away
You're in my sight
I can't believe it's true
That you are here
My future knight
Oh oh Tral blazer
Ah ah hell raiser
He flies through all eternity
Oh oh trail blazer
Ah ah hell raiser
A world where I would like to be
And there I'll be a futuristic queen
Oh oh trail blazer
Ah ah hell raiser, hell raiser
A castle fortress built To hold
A love that's born of you and me
A silent always leading
To the realms of another galaxy
And I can see the dawn of all my youth
Spread out before my eyes
There's only love
It's all for you

"Walking in the shadows of mankind
Drinking from the dust in the streets
Living through the seasons having 1000 reasons
Trying to make ends meet
Flipping coins and lights in September
Dancing with the leaves of July
February pavements seem to hold resentments
Against me as time's flying by
Gotta get home, gotta get home in December
When the lights are shining bright
Gotta get back to what I remember
And then everything's alright
Tell my mum I'm coming home in December
I have seen the Eiffel Tower in Paris
And I have seen the squares of New York
I been sleeping next to towers, singing songs for hours
Finding comfort in being a dork
Playing with the whales in the ocean
Climbing on a mountain with blue eyes
And under porches and bridges I've learned that all the riches
Are waiting for me in disguise
Gotta get home, gotta get home in December
When the lights are shining bright
Gotta get back to what I remember
And then everything's alright
Tell my mum I'm coming home in December
I want to go back, I need to go back home
My friends are waiting for me to come back home
And everybody's there and we have things to share
And the family prayer, something is in the wind and I know for sure
Deep down in the core, now it's time to go
To my loved ones, I need to go back home
Gotta get home, gotta get home in December
When the lights are shining bright
Gotta get back to what I remember
And then everything's alright
Tell my mum I'm coming home in December
I want to go back home

"Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say, ""Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
""Might be snakes there in that grass""
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell

Used to lift her face and tell her,
""Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus hands""

Used to hand me piece of candy

He didn't drop no apple core""

"You're sweet just like the sun
But what happens when the sun doesn't stay?
The night reminds me when you went away
Now my mind was pacing, heart is racing contemplating things that I lack
Even though you left me by myself, do I want you back?
Will you stay or will you walk?
Will you let go?
Leave me all alone
I'm giving you one more chance
To make things last
Ring around the roses then she'll stay
Leave me once
Leave me twice
Kiss good-bye that will suffice
When you go away
Don't look back
Leave me once and I'll be fine
Leave me twice I'll make you mine
Just one more chance to make it once again
As the days go by, I am asking why did you leave
You left me alone and then you walked out on me
Thinking of days, thinking of ways, thhinking of things that I should say
I want to be with you and that's the only way",R&B

Catching my fever

Go up in Cheetah's...

Tried to stick me for five bricks but his broads the schemer

Word is bond, I murder any bitch that fuck with my niggas

Blow a hole up in your body, straight dismantle your figure

Motherfucker still drunk off'a Bacardi and lime

Spliff, I feel this way
If it's for my squad, let's play
Back him 'gainst the door
Patch his body with gauze
Mop up the floors
Splatter nigga's blood on the walls

Bust that nigga's shit

Blow this nigga shit like horror flicks

A'yo Bus, Spliff, chill

Don't do that nigga nothing 
Blow that nigga's family up just for fronting

Yo where the bitch that was with the nigga?

Caught her with the left
Choked her by the halter, bitch bloody to death
Then the ho starts crying 'bout her hair and nails
Gettin' stomped with the shells...

...I heard the bitch-nigga yell
Caught Peter, man, by the speaker
Looked me in the eye and didn't even know
I was his brother's keeper
Slap the nigga, through him in the sleeper

Deeper and deeper
Nigga's vision start to black out, straight Grim Reaper
Still lookin for that nigga Peter

Chill, let's bounce
Spliff is high on 'bout a half an ounce
If he's hiding, we gon' find him on the eye of a needle

Yeah that's the shit I'm talking bout
Let's go fuck with his peoples
Nigga got a sister?

Yeah, she work up in Kids World
I don't know for sure, but I think the nigga live with is girl

There the nigga goes, let's hit him with the 4-5 chrome

Chill Spliff, we gon' trail this nigga's bitch ass home
Rush the crib

Kill the bitch while she ain't even looking
Still all fucked up from the last ass-whuppin
Chop the bitch up

Caught up in this foul mix-up
Tore wide open, bitch'll need a major stitch-up
Dig a ditch up where no blood-hound'll sniff up

Yo, bury that bitch, don't leave a scent for dogs to pick up

Oh shit, yo I hear somebody coming
>From the upstairs bathroom where I hear the water running

Fuck that! There the motherfucker go right there
I want a morgue for him, make that nigga's crew pall-bear
Yo let me lift him

Wait, before that, let me go kiss him

Put five in his head and wrap him in the bedspread
Fled from the scenery without nobody seeing me

If anybody ask about him we ain't seen him recently

Yeah 'cause this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it

Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet

Record stores sold out because you love it

Take my heart and never stop
There's laughter in the villages
A holiday beneath the moon
Across the world somebody dies
And still I will feel this emptiness

Do we understand that life is precious?
Do we understand that life was given?

"Love
is a disease
it infects what you believe about yourself and the others you need
and love is not kind it won't smile and it won't shine
it isn't there when you need it
you can't save it and you can't delete it
and love is cruel and unforgiving
and love is usually unwilling to give you back what you've been building
it will scorch the earth just 'cause you're tilling it
and like a cat that you've been petting for every day of every single week
but when you need it and you're feeling weak
all it really wants to do is fall asleep
because love is vicious and love is spiteful but also love also just doesn't care
so you can fight it
but when you strike at it
it will just vanish like it was never there
but believe me it's still there
not in your shoes or heart or hair
'cause I've looked in all the obvious places and still haven't found it anywhere
but when I find it I will kill it
so that I can get on with my life
and regain composure of my posture and control of the thoughts in my own mind
because love, will break you apart
But now hate is accessible and
jealousy is free
bitterness is easy and blame comes even easier for me and lust is a game that you will always will lose
but who minds losing when each level has new contestants for you to choose
and you can yell out ""okay I'm finished
now I wanna win""
well too bad 'cause winning's not up to you
all you can do is choose when to begin
to start losing something different
shaped vaguely like pride
but much bigger and much heavier and much much easier to find
and once you give that away you will know
by the sickness in your stomach and the numbness in your toes
because love, will break you apart
and love, will break you apart
and love, will break you apart
love, is hard",Indie
"With enough love to light up a sky
Earth mustve asked the Sun for a sign and he smiled
No reply, just shined, its no surprise, I see
As the winds made love to the Seas
The sand dance to the rhythm of the breeze
I believe in a Heaven
Inhaling the presence when I breathe in the essence
As the seasons change, colors of the trees excelet
Got me ready to Spring outta Autumn
Thoughts falling like leaves and Bee caught em like sneeze during Winter though
Fired in the heat of the Summer
Knew a girls name, pretty as a worlds name
Wondered with her own plans
Standing in a dream, hands stretched like wings
Trying hold on to something concrete
Like peace, live once, like 3 lost months to weeks
Days, pass the blunts
Let her grab that once
Bet she hasnt dreamt about this yet
Bet, some summers you just never forget
Till the day always don't mean I'll be okay
Till the night I'll be alright with no delay
Visualize open your eyes you'll see your way
It's yours and mine, no dream divine, I see the rays
Uh, Yeah, check it out
Thoroughbred, whole century later now we ahead
Pause, no skipping 'em either
Bought me a red tape and spit a razor like you walk with the dreads
Them shooting phazers can't fade him he blessed
Vibing out to the child, because son don't rest
Let you catch him at the riverbank fresh off the last train of thought, lost
Throwing stones in the dark
Who cares, when charisma can be sought
Cause I'm plastering charts, we art
Fuck a book when they still take a look
I tell em please no pictures yo, bought to be mindful
So read those scriptures, I swear, saw solemn he's still bigger than omeli
Survivors of poverty, put it on my aunties and momma b
I'd kiss em if I was me
Seen em insecurities and washed em like God's feet, golly
Boy's be on line 3, they comatose on sleep
I'm next to em friendly remind, rewind through the week
Got felines and reeks like to reach might impeach if he reach
So he keep those special occasions, like heat
Big fun from a fucking pan tell me that I didn't win, blunts lifted
Kiss me baby roll tight as some legs be
Sitting on a pedestal, grace queen
Bling gonna blind em, Wyclef bling, clotheslined out the ring
Good thing you wasn't woofing bout a dream
Have you ever seen reality, shines bright as a day
Chases the moon till she falls asleep, so she's my sunshine
Till the day always don't mean I'll be okay
Till the night I'll be alright with no delay

Let there be light
The stars will rise
Then fall again
Climbing to the top
An empty room
Is all there is
Oh I fear it is
Prophecies were made of you and I
The vision's strong
But meanwhile keep on falling
Oh what a miracle is life
An even bigger one is size
It's just the way it is
I fear it is
It's just the way it is
Life's a wheel nothing more
It goes round and around and a...
I am the ageless
I am ""Legion""
I'm your lord
I will bring terror
I'm a demon in disguise
The thrill of a thousand
Worlds dying at once
But my ultimate goal
Lies beyond the downfall
Touched by the Crimson King
Touched By the Saviour
The tower falls on Judgement Day
Touched By the Crimson King
Touched By the Saviour

When the moonlight leaves the trees
But I will always feel the embers
Of the flames in Tennessee
I was sleeping when they came knocking
They said boy you better leave
Said South Nashville is rocking
And they can't get no relief
So I run and put my pants on
And I run to get my car
But the flames they was a rising
And I didn't get to far
There was a black man on the corner
He said boy just turn away
I got a gun here in my pocket
And I will take your life away
So I showed the man your picture
And I said we had a son
And I was just up here from Texas
I wasn't hurting anyone
So I run out to the highway
And I finally caught a ride
With some white trash outta towner
With his wife and kids inside
So I sit here on the roadside
And I talk to your machine
I can see the flames a rising
Over Nashville Tennessee
Well, don't go out looking on your TV
They gonna keep this all discreet
They will never tell the secrets
Of the flames in Tennessee
You know I hope she don't discover
That this all was all just a lie
But If I don't get home to see her
Then my heart will surely die
I will see you in the morning

Hundred dollars to a couple grand
Couple grand to a hundred bands
Hundred bands to them big Ms
And my weight up like six gyms
I'm outchea and I mean that
We The Best, where my team at?
Bad vibes, I don't need that
I done came too far to be lookin' back
I made my way from the bottom
And I'm grindin' 
I wake up every morning lookin' for commas 
'Bout my dollars 
I'm goin' all out and that's on my mama 
On my mama

Ain't no sleepin'

I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it
Sometimes I wonder why I even try
So why should I feel blue?

I poked my head out silent, that's how it started
What to my eyes appeared as dust
Became a vision I don't know
What had finally found me with my back against the wall
Was destiny intruding all around me
And as the day wore on I knew
Another lonely night could never be
If there's is a reason you might try and forget
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry
So why should I feel blue?
I was caught drifting disappearing from the land
Whitecaps in profusion all around me
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength
To sail upon the raging sea
If theres a reason for the way that life is
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it
Sometimes I wonder why I even try
So why should I feel blue?
What had finally found me with my back against the wall
Was destiny intruding all around me

Another lonely night with you could never be

"I sent my crack divisions through the early morning mist
When they fell on your positions you were powerless to resist
Encircling and probing for the weakness in your line
By night you were surrounded; your territory mine
I called for your surrender; this you swore you would not do
So I stormed the very fortress, you thought could shelter you
I held you then upon your knees and turned to give my thanks
To the regiments assembled in their ranks
CHORUS
Where are they now?
Where are they now?
I raised you to your feet, with your hand inside my own
We set off upon a journey, each together, each alone
In the days that followed oh our lives did overlap
I learned the contours of your body like the roads upon a map
You sweetened every evening, I savoured every day
Just when I was certain it would always be this way
You slipped beyond the reach of my outstretched fingertips
With all the kisses we'd placed upon your lips
CHORUS
Oh close. You're close
Someone, come shine a light
Oh near. So near
But just out of sight
I went in search of alchemy to resurrect the dead
Sent my spies to fathom out the secrets in your head
They said they heard your laughter
Spinning through the summer night
In the company of strangers
And your eyes were wild and bright
Though I grew reclusive and my days became withdrawn
I held the banner of our love, now tattered and forlorn
And swore that it would one day fly above us once again
To do this, I had my reasons then
CHORUS
Close. You're close
Once again, come shine a light
Oh near. So near
But just out of sight
Perhaps there are some passions that are tempered by the years
You reach accommodation, the intensity recedes
Some of this occurred to me the time I saw you last
Your face familiar in a way. Your voice out of the past
Every gamut of emotion shared from tenderness to rage
Fell away between us in the turning of that page
It seemed like only yesterday we swore that we'd be true
Two innocents believing that they knew

Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! 
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard

A bleeding heart we share, now on Azrael?s wings.
I fall like autumn rain?
You are my everything.
This lovelorn kiss of death in lugubrious silence?
Dawn breaks open like a wound? and the dreadful sun
Two souls entwined together,
Still so alone.
Both you and I are shattered
And frozen in stone.
You begged for air from within this cold tomb
With pain sharp as a knife.
I now lie resting like a child on thy womb,
Gave back a part of my life.
For a while it had disappeared, but nothing was changed.
A haze fell forever with her fading life.
I leaned my head back? then drank of opaline.
The emerald goddess came to me? she craved my soul.
And just for a while? I had forgotten.
Yes, it was all forgotten, but nothing was changed.
Suddenly a cold breeze blew across our room?
It felt like I wanted to leave? this world with her.
Come; drink with me the divine nectar of Olympus!
Sit beside me and help defy our adversity and loss?
This adversity and loss. It all ends with you!

Swept away by heavy eyelids; forever in my dreams?

Don't be clappin' if you nuttin'

Spark up the flame and go up
I ain't changed nigga, turn down for what?

Big houses and chains ain't enough
Takin' shots with some drank in my cup

You niggas just like these hoes, y'all keep savin'
Waiting on my downfall, then keep waitin'
Brother man, nigga wanna cum again
Squeezing on her booty in them yoga pants
You can always kinda tell the ones that's with it
I shouldn't be able to smell it, before I hit it 
I know my limits, I only fuck with bitches
That's limited edition
These other bitches get no attention, no
So I hit them with that Henney shot face
Yeah she eating pussy, but she not gay 
Don't be fronting all on twitter for the retweet
You heard about that XXL threepeat
Let's get it poppin' and celebrate with they knockers
Shout out to my brother Logic
Haters is really runnin' out of options
So I guess we should
Spark up the flame and go up
I ain't changed nigga, turn down for what?

Big houses and chains ain't enough
Takin' shots with some drank in my cup 
I, I've been on some west coast player shit
City full of pimps, we'll take a bitch

Is held by your ways of hate
It will hold better ways to live
When you choose to let it give
If the door slams in your face
Your mind slows down its pace
All the anger, all these things
Make it stop all it brings
Take my hand and follow me
Look and I'll show you what I see
Make a wall and stand in my way
It will come out, this is what I say!
If I had the same door as you
Would I lock it as you do?
Do what you do, Say what you say
Would you live or die where you lay?

Shines back in your eyes
You'll see what happened
Blindly say your good-byes!

Our blood runs cold
Endure our winter thirty fold

Poisoned our young for the last time

Let this be the battle cry for all these unlawful crowned heads.
They masquerade themselves as the bringers of freedom.
But shall we sell our souls

victims of an ideology
that keeps it's fellows small-minded.
They poison the innocence of our hearts

which they impose on us
and which are the pillars of their heretical belief.

"Still blindly we plunge into the web again.
Our hands still soaked with blood soiled straight through to the skin.
Turned the soil still wet from last time's shallow graves,
we remain entangled in this web of war we've made.
1999 turned about reads triple 6, but do you pale at the slightest hint of coincidence?
If so you're bound to play a part in all our destruction.
If we believe the myths we create then we are bound to live them.
Still many of us, sick and twisted, eagerly await our turn to die.
We sit obedient after each atrocity, too desensitized to even cry.
We are bound to what we so foolishly inspected.
Others ensnared by chance into the trap others have erected.
Are we bound to this vicious cycle of agression
and then vengeance by some uncontrollable flaw in our natural human condition?
If we are but wild animals acting on some instinctual competition
then why is it leading us onward toward our assured extinction?
No, this web of war is not a part of nature's vast creation,
but the product of mankind's fear of self and his infatuation
with dominance and destruction and the conquest of all,
he fears himself therefore he will destroy himself in the end.",Rock

Didn't fund the damn levee

Now our whole damn cities torn us under man

We see hurricane spills overrun the land
Through gaps you couldn't fill with a hundred tons of sand
No we still don't understand
We've seen planes in the windows of buildings
Crumbled in
We've seen flames sending chills through London
And we've sent planes to kill them
And some of them are children

Criticize they but who the f**k are we

But the leaders want war

House representatives preach stay the course
Its time for a leap of faith

Put your hands up high if you haven't imagined
Hope that the pen strokes higher than the cannon
Balls to the wall nose to the grindstone

Places your bets lets peak to the enemy

"The end of the Line
Calamity at first sight
Now the man in me don't walk right
Just like a pebble in my shoe
But you were a wanderer
And a competent one at that
So it caught me by surprise this venerability
That i never thought i had
Oh and you Tried so hard to say
everything you wanted to
and with an aching tongue
You spat out at the world now not of words
but of a pearl that had belonged to her
So i went back to the country
where the air was mild and sweet
i was in need of some reprieve and intermission
To gather up my things and to get back upon my feet
But i cant say I've got the answers
For its always shades of grey
But theres a warmth in the air in mid september
And its enough across my face just to
Remind me that I'm well upon my way
And i feel the ease
Man i feel it tingle in my toes
How funny are the way that these memories do grow
Into some old french film in black and white
And i know the ropes
Because you see I've said goodbye to some lovers
Fleshed out and tied to each other
By that invisible string it tangles me
and when that morning came up fast well it
Broke the fever square upon its back
and finally i felt just like i should
oh the blood under my fingers warm
the clearing of a two month storm now done
So i went back to the country
where the air now bitter sweet
and subtle is the change of my indifference
But strange how the solitude
can leave a man complete
and i cant wait 'till the morning
be it sunshine hail or snow
see i do not believe in superstition
But somewhere upon this mess
i may have found some happiness to call my own
Oh and time is a healer
time is a friend of mine
in time if you feel it
would you be a friend of mine
oh i hope you're a friend of mine",Indie

Truth lurks hidden in the shadows
Dreams might be filled with lies
Soon there will be light
Pain remains inside
Suddenly it seemed so clear
All the blindness was taken away
She closed her eyes
And she called out my name
She was never ever seen again
Harvest of Sorrow
Your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of life shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin
She is gone
And I fall from grace
No healing charm covers my wounds
Fooled's the dawn
And so am I
Fooled by life and a bitter doom
To bring you the end of the day
At the dawn of our living time
Hope it soon will pass by
Facing a darkness
I stand alone
Harvest of Sorrow
Your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of life shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin",Metal
"I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be?
So, never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always, let it be me",Country

Come on and ride with me, ride with me, ride with me

We ride them twinkys on 'bout everythang 
We ride them twinkys on 'bout everythang 
We ride them twinkys on 'bout everythang 
We ride them twinkys on 'bout everythang 

We ride them twinkys on big 1500's
And it don't matter what you sittin' them on, we done already done it
And on the inside smell like wooood, cause that rifer be burnin'
And on the outside lookin' gooood, cause them twinkys be turnin'
I got them thangs shinin' hard so they match my grill 
And got them big bitches twisting like four farris wheels
We from the gump so we be mashin' like we don't give a fuck
And man we sit them twinks on Capri' Classic, Lacs, and trucks
And rule number one don't let them twinkys hit the curve
And if you need two more inches call them 'twity birds'
And it ant nothin like lettin' a junky clean and wash your car
Break them off a fat dime and watch it shine like a star 
And if you sittin' up on some nineteens then you still tight
But if you ain't ridin' twinky inch rims it don't fill right
But after a while everything you ride got to get old 
But for now we ride them twinkys like we was ""Rollin' Vogues""
On tripple gooold
 X 2

We ride them twinkys on big Escalades
Them thangs so wide man they provide my whole damn block with shade
I know you jock'em cause they shiney and they sit real high
Cause when I roll it's nothin' but rim you can't even see the tire
I keep'em glossy cause they sit up under my ride so pretty
And when the sun bank off my rim they light the whole damn city
I keep that paint job wet it's how it suppose to be
And got them guts plushed out with leather upholstery
Man we be chieffin' up a storm so them windows stay fogged
And plus I'm swervin' side to side cause we been sippin' that Paul
You know down south them boys like ridin' higher than Big Foot
And if you slippin' with your twinkys you gone get yours took
Some folks say you shouldn't even drive cause it's takin' up lanes
Man kiss my ass y'all just mad cause y'all ain't got the same thang
And shit is just a little bit different on a high speed chase
The police won cause when I come I take up all the space, up all the space
 X 2

I done seen some niggas in Impalas sittin' cold
I done seen some niggas in Expedations ridin' swolle
I done seen some Astro vans with some rims so big
All them niggas pushin' doolys ridin' twinky inch
I done seen some thangs on Beamers with the top drop down
I done seen some Jagurs sittin' high off the ground
I done seen some niggas in Land Cruiser sittin' tall
We sit them twinks on everythang cause hell we ride'em all

Now I done seen them thangs on Capri' Classics and lookin' so pretty
And got them Cutlus and Regals sittin' so right when they beat through the city
And them Suburns got them thangs so right plushed out with the kit
It took a nigga from the hood to sit the twinkys on Crown Vics
And when them hoes see them thangs on Navigators they love'em
But when they see them on Lacs boy it make it easy to fuck'em
And that's all good if you got them thangs on chrome and gold
You probably catch a nigga from Slapaw ride'em on Pentos, on Pentos

As others were - I have not seen
As others saw - I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I loved, I loved alone.
Then - in my childhood - in the dawn
Of a most stormy life - was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that 'round me rolled
In it's autumn tint of gold
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form

Of a demon in my view.",Metal

Del, champion of true I do what the others can't do
So when ya come to, recognize I despise weak
I'm at my peak I seek more then the boredom that you are accustomed to
The conoseur I love hip-hop more, then I did as a kid so I gotta get rid
Of those who pose, case closed
I'm dynamic with panic and that's exactly how I planned it

You better peep 'cause the price steep for those who sleep
I pile my rhymes by the heap on cassettes, Lp's, cd's and 12 inches
Perform the shit and get the girl like pinches
With good intentions, the key word is redemption
For those who try to shit on my crown let's get down
Plastic ass rappers get smashed like crackers
First I shalack ya and hit ya with the lacquer
Then I go to marijuana class to study cultivation
So I can make the USA a better nation
Get smoked, mellow out, vibe fuck the stress
While I kill MC's that say ""he's relentless.""
Past you at last due to technological enhancements on my part the art advances
My rhymes are ravishing, ravaging the hip-hop surface
To get to the underground for pounds and purchase
Merciless, as soon as I insert the disc
into the SP to make the world stress me
Let's be upfront and real
What's up with this rap regurgitation that appeal to the masses?
I got pure plain funk hold the Mayo
Like the formulation of ice crystals make the suns halo a rainbow
Painful to MC's at large I barge and bulldoze them all when I charge
Personally responsible, behind all the hoopla
Haven't crossed the board, get the troubleshoota

Stress the world...
Stress the world...

Let's be upfront and real
Mathematically correct, collect wreck on the daily
This ain't Prince project put out on plays the part
Deep dark funk to dunk your face in
Fully animated in a time when hip-hop's contaminated
Wit corny niggaz talkin jibberish they make me feverish
I merely pull this lever which enables me to unveil tails of Del in action
Smoked to fullest, project my voice like bullets
I deflect you sect. I check the scanner
Damn you're persistent, I stand wit my fist clenched
Tightly around the microphone like a septer
Wit rhymes average MC's can't see like a specter
The inspector with the nectar, sharp like a Black and Decker
I twist a nigga neck like chubby checker
Respect the Hieroglyphic insignia
you know it means murda wit lyrics unhearda
Stamina, stamina. And wit a new flow to boot
Don't try to execute my patter-ns
I took hella notes while battlin'
Dismantlin' opponents alone with my trusty verbs leavin' MC's disturbed
Everybody on my block know I rock
To MC's I'm hella cocky so I keep my rhymes cocked in position
And if you actually listen to what I'm sayin' you'll see you can't resist 'em
They're succulent and if you don't like them fuck you then
Anybody with taste see it's a delicacy
Not a mere orderve or haven't you heard
And it's totally take out about a million served like that
Absolutely a beauty to crush the shit that's booty

Ay will you be my, my summer drug
Ay will you be my, the one to drive me crazy

I'm digging your elegance
I think that you know that it's prevalent
We got some time that we gonna spend
But, we gotta get rid of the negatives
You could be something like my friend
I think that they call that with benefits
You be my drug, you be my medicine
You be my love, we'll talk about stuff like
Where do you think heaven is?
And do you think Kanye is heaven-sent
Smoking it medically when we be puffing the lye
You never do know when you're gonna die
Just give me the truth, I'll give it to you
That's all I can ask with you by my side
Summertime no longer students
It don't matter what we doing
Out her jamming, drinking, dreaming lucid, making music
If you ride with me it's all inclusive, without the strings
So baby let me know you wanna be my summer fling
Baby let me know you wanna be my summer fling
Like what up!

Will you be my, no need to rewind
I'm out of my mind, I do realize
Relying on time, will be our demise
But who can deny, a walk on the beach
40 ounce, Backwoods and life
Cold Miller Lights
Nights will be colder, we taking too much to hide
You by my side, It always feels right
Though I just met you tonight
I'll take your light, I don't wanna do wrong
I just wanna do right, I'm blind by the lights
I'm on my way home but hoping that you'll be my ride
Cus I will not lie
Them ubers empty make a nigga feel empty inside
If I can't smoke cigarettes in your ride
I'll make it short with a deuce and a line
Summertime nights got me feeling cold inside
Chi-town got a nigga ready to ride
Shoutout to you for the summertime vibes
I keep it trill on these summertime nights
You keep it real on these summertime nights
Now flame up this wood and let's feel alright

You're gonna know what it means to be blue
You're gonna know how it feels to feel your heart breaking in two

I'll hear you say you're so sorry we are through
I'll be the first one to have you because you'll need someone that's true

"Money, for the money 

Kanye told me that Jesus walks in '04
But I grew up around impalas and drug lords
Welcome to Los Angeles palm trees and drug stores
All we know is rocks and presidents like Mount Rushmore
Fuck the police they hop out and bust doors
I ain't goin' back to jail nigga that what I flush for
My money or my glock who do I trust more?
I don't know it's probably the one that I touch more
Guess it's the green cause paper motivate niggas
And my Rolex races cause it hate niggas
I use to only sell 8s like that Laker nigga
Now I'm movin' 24s like I play at the staples center
You might miss the game so nigga don't blink
My phantom stand out like Frank Lucas mink
So go ahead and think like Frank Lucas think
Somebody'll find your brains on the fuckin' kitchen sink about


Dead presidents, Big paper

Benjamins, Skyscrapers, My niggas get

My Bitches get

Like the strippers get
From the block to the club I make it rain

In California niggas die

From the south to new york the bullets fly for the

Don't stop gettin'

It don't matter where you from if you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that


Yeah Yeah
I get it that baby and slim cash money
All the jewelry on your whole crew that's my tax money
That Pablo Escobar crack money
That Lebron first nike contract money
That make it rain all my niggas throw a stack money
Stack it to the ceiling then call it Shaq money
That walk in the club, straight to the back money
Flavor of love delicious sittin' on my lap money
That rat money niggas get clapped money
Air force ones don't bend when I track money
Oh I'm rich like porter,
Havin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that border
Like McDonald's I was flippin' them orders
In that '02 Porsche truck weavin' through borders
I was through flippin' quarters When I made my first mil
I'm about a dollar 50 cent ain't real


Ooh Somebody tell snoop to pop open them briefcases
Order that patron tell em we want 3 cases
Fuck a black card you see these green faces
Look at my chest, now you've seen Vegas
Treat my money like the Crystal that we wastin'
Cause I'm a money machine I can re-make it
You a fool thinkin' that Freddy can see Jason
I been iced out like who the fuck need Jacob
The doc told me to be patient but I walked
Money like the white Howard next time he a free agent
I'm tryin' to make enough money so I can feed Asia
Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V aprons
Word to Martha Stewart if I can park a Buick
Then I can flip a breech truck I got the heart to do it
Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
Speak no englis but Dinero I talk it fluent

That be scattering
Over the global my vocals be traveling unraveling my abdomen
It's slime that's babbling grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madeline was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believing everything I'm reading
But my brain was bleeding, needing feeding and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, cause I was guilty in a sense
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas, now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruising Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it

I wonder which us is better
Which one our parents loved the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
And they seemed to let the other go
A tear fell from my father's eye
I wondered what my dad would say
He said, ""I love you and I'm proud of you both,
In so many different ways""

Go and read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings
Pay attention to the list

Make sure my daughter knows the same

Nobody lived what I lived, nobody knows what I know
Morning - dusk of my neverending life
I shall not live without you

I have no heart - my hands are cold
White as the purest snow
Sick as my entire cadaver
The whole world
All is white now
I feel your eyes caressing me
I feel your presence - always
And I pray for you to be - I believe
Je sens son corps entrer en toi
Je te sens t'ouvrir, le desirer...
Puis fuir, ne plus en vouloir, en finir enfin
Fais moi hurler
Il m'a viole

Je ne t'ai jamais vraiment aime
J'ai toujours fait semblant
Je ne peux que verser
Quelques larmes de sang
En finir, t'achever
A jamais innocente
Fall, angel fall
Fall for me
Dare the flesh, taste the human curse
And love, only
My lovely creature

Come accomplish your destiny
Girl, your father will cry for you tonite
Spread your wings angel
Spread your thighs for me 
One union forever

Tu etais vierge mon amour

"A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp stands out in this mem'ry I revive
'Cause my daddy raised a family there with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes
He dreamed of something better and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted but it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed one more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage as their age began to show
And one more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes
Mama never had the luxuries...

"The angel horde appears,
In the horizon cloaked with shining white.
In thousands they came for the war,
that would become the final battle and greatest of them all.
The trumpets of God they are blown,
And the angels are pulling their swords.
What god's army did not know,
Were that I had awakened the thirteen warlords.
Of hell.
The angels moved towards the fortress,
Thinking they had a chance.
Their invasion started from the east,
With soldiers carrying leather slings.
Running towards their own doom,
Now in the eternal fire they forever are consumed.
The sun shall turn to darkness,
And the moon into blood.
Before the great and terrible day
When my judgment comes.
Angel flesh impaled, it is so beautiful.
Feathers falling down, over the bloodstained ground.
The painful angels scream, sweet music to my ears.
It's like a dream,
Trucido Christianese.
Now the angels attacked with full force,
But their front, were slain with no remorse.
Angel's blood soon covered the ground,
One thirteen was attacking from behind.
I strike upon them with all my hate,
Soon they all know it is too late.
Realize they all will die,
When my archers hatred are covering the sky.
With the ancients by our side,
Without fear of god his army we stride.
If only the angels could tell,
The pain that they felt, when I released the flames of hell.
Angel flesh impaled, it is so beautiful.
Feathers falling down, over the bloodstained ground.
The painful angels scream, sweet music to my ears.
It's like a dream,
Trucido Christianize.
The sun will never rise, darkness will rule supreme.
Our rightful throne reclaimed, 1000 years from this day.
The coming of our lord, soon again he'll walk the earth.

"At the root of revolution there must exist
a love of life in it's purest form, life with total freedom.
For how long can we stifle our yearning for release?
How long until our kind realizes there is nothing beyond our reach?

Anarchy and Peace
These chains that we all where, are they for our protection?
Or do they keep us bound to the system we've created to save us from ourselves.
What are we really scared of ?
Cast off these chains and take what gifts true freedom has to offer.

In our nervous anxiety toward random chance, uncontrollable change,
and all that is unpredictable, we have set a huge trap for ourselves
and created a race within a vicious circle ever turning back
to it's mournful legacy of self-destruction.
I now call out from one to another,
it's time that tradition be denied
so that a primal wave of passion
and true desire can unleashed upon this vicious human cycle,
turning it outward and giving us the power to manipulate
what will be the destiny of us all.
So with this love of life,arm your desire.
The tribe is growing larger ,so watch this spark become the fire
that lays this farce called government to it's final ruin
and the past shall fade away as the flames consume them.

"You always loved the colors and the details, so here's mine: I snuck out down a dark 17th Street late last night. I took my little orange book lamp and the notebook with the stars on the front, the sleeping bag that my ex gave to me to keep me warm, and a black fountain pen to write the words that it was too late to say out loud.
And my eyes turned green, like they do when I'm crying, and my heart it went to blue 'cause you told me that I might not be what you need, you want to try more out, but you're the only thing I can't stop thinking about.
Yeah, I like you a lot.. and I think it's worse than that.
You said you love it when all the words in a song move really fast and your ears have to choose just one little phrase to hold on to. And you love it when all the chords are really simple so you can play it on the guitar, and then when it goes to a funny one at the end you like that too . And so I'll build you a song, and I know you're gonna love it 'cause I'm putting in all the pieces that you said you wanted in it and I'm writing it here in my room in just my underwear and an orange t-shirt 'cause I know that you'd think that was hot.
Yeah hot, like that day that you called sick for work because we'd stayed out too late at The Cheesecake Factory the night before and we held hands on the beach, and I found that crab in a funny shell, and you took video of me holding it up by the newly painted blue motel. And you said ""I like you a lot"" and I thought 'well, this couldn't get much better.'
You said you were so happy you met me when you did 'cause you were starting to think you didn't like people. And you told me that when I moved that I could still stay in your room for weeks. But now I'm wondering if I imagined it or if it was ever really there 'cause they say even in magic nothing truly disappears, it just gets stuffed up somebody's sleeve or behind their hand or on top of their head.. and you forgot to keep your eye on it, you were looking down instead.
So now I'm the fool up on stage at the magic show searching the deck for my card while everyone laughs because they know that it's in plain sight to see, yeah it's stuck on your forehead, but I can't think you're mean 'cause I volunteered to be misled.
Yeah 'cause I like you a lot.. but I don't know what to do with it now.
And I like you a lot.. but I didn't think it'd hurt this bad.

The serpent he moved, but no-one would say.
The depths of the waters, the bridge which distraught us
And brought to me thoughts of the ill-fated day.

"
 Come, sleeper to the window, do you know
Us know? Have we changed? Have you seen us here
Before? Do you remember long ago
You summoned us across the high frontier
Of sleep, and bid us urgently appear.
You called, we came, we waited every night,
Like crystals in solution coming clear,
Until your dream was sharp enough and bright
To waken you with stabs of appetite.
 Is this the moment in my story when
The messengers of destiny prepare
The usual historic specimen,
Some lonely little hero starving there,
And feed him with the fruits of solitaire?
Is this my miracle of bread and fishes?
This the mystery of answered prayer?
Is this my table laid with golden dishes?
 Let us not say prayer, let's just say wishes.
Don't stand there dreaming, let us in,
It wasn't all that easy getting here. We had
To metamorphosize at least a hundred
Thousand times through all the dreary realms of
Sense, just to get us from the astral, to
The mental, to the solid and the dense.
And that's not counting countless times we spent
Manifesting aimlessly as
Elements of chaos in the undifferentiated
Anti-universe before
We even had a chance to be unborn
As shadowy particals in streams of light --
Now hurry up, we haven't got all night!
 What am I supposed to do?
 Ask for something.
 I can't think.
 Come on darling.
 Help me!
 You can ask for peace on earth. There's a few
That do. Or you can ask for peace of mind.
It's very rare but we've had one or two.
Or ask that human suffering unwind

Too abstract -- somewhat off the beaten track.

 Well could I have someone to love?
 You can
 Can I send her away?
 We have written it down.
 Then could I call her back again?
 You certainly can, you merry-go-man.
 Could I write whatever's in my heart?
 It's on your desk, the writer's mighty pen.
 And could I sing whatever's in my heart?
 Just close your eyes and keep your lips apart.
 I could have my heart's desire when
And where and how my heart desires it?
And could I bring the whole world to my heart?
 O Jesus, not the heart, the heart again
So boring. Everyone's like everyone
Your famous heart is like an onion,
All layers and layers of wild distress
All gathered into rings round nothingness.
 But can I have it, can I have it?
 Yes!
 If woman, heart and song are mine
The rest will come, where do I sign?
 But could he write whatever's in his heart?
 It's on his desk, the writer's mighty pen.
 And could he sing whatever's in his heart?
 He'll close his eyes and keep his lips apart
 And could he have his heart's desire when
And where and how his heart desires it?
 And could I bring the whole world to my heart?
 O Jesus, not the heart, the heart again
So boring. Everyone's like everyone
Your famous heart is like an onion,
All layers and layers of wild distress
All gathered into rings round nothingness.
 But can I have it?
 Can he have it?
 Yes!
 Can I have it?
 Can he have it?
 Yes!
 The night is ending, we have many duties
Still, much gold and silver light to spill
On anxious girls and frightened boys like you,
All brooding deeply on some window sill.
But one condition there remains to fill.
One term before the heart begins to play
With other hearts the music of its will.
 If I don't agree?
 Still you have to pay
The ordinary price that humans pay...
With suff'ring, joy, redemption, and decay!
 All my heart's desire ... let's keep the part
about joy.
 It's a package.
 ...Suffering, redemption, and decay!
 It's a bitch.
 I have to get some sleep, I'm opening
tomorrow night.
 Then you agree?
 Yes, yes, I agree.
 ...Do you remember long ago
You summoned us across the high frontier
Of sleep and bid us urgently appear.",Rock

Seventy-five extra mail mannish hard-headed hoodlum-ass niggas
On the dope track workin' overtime full of fuckin 'd' 
Runnin' through somewhere in the neighborhood
Of about seven-hundred thousand in illegal narcotics
Generatin' through mah street, a week

Even on my hip pretty much needlin' and jugglin'

But left when I was ten, so moms is all I had
And she was there for me until I ran away from the pad
And now she disowned me and she don't claim me
Reverend wouldja put some blessin' oil on my head
Before I end up dead, gall bladder full of lead - scared
I guess a hard-head make a soft-ass ?
I ain't gon' last if I keep fuckin' with this fast life

He would grow up to be nothin' but a hoodlum
Or either in jail, or someone would shoot him, uh

Don't wanna go to church, because I feel guilty
Nope - I don't wanna die, cause when the preacher preach the gospel
I be ready to cry, up in the church of pentecostal
I don't think I'm a make it to see twenty-five
Til I wash my hands and come clean
Shit I'll be hella happy if I can just live to see sixteen
No life to give for that nastiness
As a rebellious disobedient-ass problem child
He's easily influenced, hangin' around the wrong crowd
I'm willin' to do almost anything,
Whatever it takes to make my allowance
I'm on prescription medication, chemically off-balance
Got me snatchin' up ? pickin' up hits
Pick-pickin' indo's , and pullin' licks

But daddy?  tie my shoes  lace me up 
Hook me up, like a tow-track man 
Ear-hustlin', make like a pampered suck-up game-a-saur 
When it comes to this thang man I'm connoisseur 
I read through the punk registry in the robb report 
I come off like dat
Grew up around slick talkers 
A pa-a poppin' con artists 
Go straight to the ? and get a bad leather jacket
? bankrupt!
Boy you,
Like you when I was younger
But I got my life together
And I bettered myself as I got older

"Weak and sick I crawl
In the dust of past mistakes
Leaving for the darkness
Of tears and cold heartaches
Suffer in this grief
Of forever burning hate
The ashes of my life
By the torment you create
On my knees, remembering
The wasted years of dark insanity
The rage increases fast
As the memories eat me alive
God, I wish this to end
But I'm not prepared to die
No more a human being
Just a fool of anxiety
Unable to escape
The darkest insanity",Metal

Besame besame mucho
Cette chanson d'autrefois je la chante pour toi
Besame besame mucho
Comme une histoire d'amour qui ne finirait pas
On l'a chantÃ©e dans les rues
Sur des ciels inconnus et dans toute la France
On la croyait oubliÃ©e
Et pour mieux nous aimer voilÃ  qu'elle recommence
Besame besame mucho
Si dans un autre pays Ã§a veut dire embrasse-moi
Besame besame mucho
Toute ma vie, je voudrais la chanter avec toi
On ne demande Ã  l'amour
Ni serment de toujours ni dÃ©cor fantastique
Pour nous aimer il nous faut
Simplement quelque mots qui vont sur la musique

I see the corner, puttin' chalk around the snitch,
We be shootin' like free throws, flying them desert Eagles,
Sell dope to the pope, while we eatin' chilli freetos
From a gang-banger, to a CEO,
Everything I do is big like the nigga Ceaser-leo,
Wont stop till I'm dead,
Ain't gotta watch for the feds,
They ain't watchin' me so here's a dome shot to the head
As I take a Patron shot to the head,
And reminisce about the shit the DOC said,
""Get money, Get cars, get mine, get yours,
And keep your head up, like the Lambo doors""

Guess its time to break the number nine Jordan's in,
Make a nigga made, when they been tryna floor the Benz,
I'm doin' one sixty in the fast lane,
Scott Storch, in his Bogadi, couldn't pass game,
I got it made like my last name,
I'm gone, just like my After-math Chain
Don't make me take you back to '96,
Leanin' on that dostin', on the corner, eatin' catfish,
The Game, Da-Da-Da-Game, spit that shit,
I'm controversial, like the Afro-pic with the Black fist,
Just ask the rapper that had to catch my last diss,
I'm reckless, and I ain't never crash whips,

Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear,
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
""Arise and go"", the angles said.

For there you'll find this happy morn,
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born.
There were three wise men from afar
Directed by a glorious star,
And on they wandered night and day
Until they came where Jesus lay,
And when they came unto that place
Where our beloved Messiah was,
They humbly laid at his feet,
Their gifts of gold and incense sweet.",Folk

Case number C601999

Will The defendant please stand,
Is there anything you wish to say on this matter
Before sentencing Bizzy Bone?

No man
You know the motherfucker did it

Well the court sentences you to death by electric chair


We had to get 'em up with two thugs
Runnin' side by side with number one
Murder mo drop my gauge on 'em
When the po-po chase,
If they catch me barehanded I'm done
Rip's gripping the six shot pump, so spill it
Copper lettin' the lead off
Copper thought that he had me caught
Little Layzie blew his head off
Get him up, and get up,
The bullets they start to get lit up,
Number one best start duckin' with ah gun already buckin'
Bust me lead on the double glock 'n
Where the fiends roll up for rocks 'n,
This perfect getaway,
From the pigs when I peel and I hit the fences,
Rippin' up the trench and,
I'm bailing while they trailing
Better in hell than in the cell
And it ain't no telling where the coppers be dwelling,
One had spotted me, pick up ah piece and shot a me
But I practice what I preach
And see that these slugs up in his body got him,
Run, wid smoke coming from the barrel ah me gun
Hit the bend, oh what the dumb dumb I got yum yummed on the dead end
They set in, then they lead in,
They wanting me off in the coffin
Cops from everywhere was yellin and wailin' I went unconscious,
From the stompin' taking ah loss, and waking up in the coffin,
And without no stallin'
Cell I was tossed in to be arraigned at dawning,
Looking in the eyes of a judge,
He knew right where to put that thug
Made to be so, with no parole
In the hole but I won't budge
Sent me to deathrow,
Watchin' the time by fly past
But Rip'll be sittin' mindless never spineless, in silence
Hoping I die fast, but chill,
Never do, sleepa, gotta get put that on all me reefer
Somehow must beat ya, so peep out the creep or the reaper will meet ya

Bailin' on ah mission, flippin' the script
Betta check what the wind just blew in
Betta think again, it's a preacher with ah grin
On ah mission for revenge, with that Mack-10
Little nigga Rip, had to empty the clip
Gotta pump them slugs up in them cops
Steady made 'em drop glock went pop pop
Goin' out like a thug on the double glock,
Back from hell and ready to bail,
Time to hit they trail cause they wanted my nigga fried
Holdin' the Bible when I got a grenade I'ma go inside the squad,
Gettin' ready for the rumble
When I heard them mumbles, pullin' me gauge in laughter
Keep buckin 'em faster all I was thinkin'
When I see them busters scatter
Betta watch out for them buckshot's
Cause them can't fade me gauge,
Gotta bust them souls in the grave,
So I'm buckin' them straight to the pave, can't be saved,
I'm bucking, little Ripster reinforcements comin' in faster
Blast give my nigga double Zs the Mack-10
Lettin' the gun gun blaze on they ass,
Gotta rip in them chests through vests
Mack-10s, sawed off eruptions, got plenty ammunition
No missing listen destruction I'm bustin'
Cause I'm making that getaway, bound to getaway,
Niggas got to escape and it's never to late
When you dash and tryna' break
Nigga just can't test the Bone fate
We steadily runnin' duckin'
Comin' up to the front door barri-caded,
And I pulled ah grenade, tossed to the door, let it explode
And we made it, creepin' in the courtyard
So Krayzie feelin' safety coming
Hittin' the fence and jump in it quick
From Krayzie's tech-9 bullets humming.
Well it seems as if them two boys Bizzy and Layzie
Done got they selves into another jam


Soon as I went in the smoke, rollin' real fast like a dog
And began with a rage and the gauge can't let go
They done labelled my nigga psychotic
Bitches is got him sittin' on deathrow,
Scoping out the tower peeping the scene
So when my niggas trail,
Screaming out one eighty seven and bail,
Gotta get my nigga Rip out that cell, it's all over now,
How my nigga number one disguised as the preacher,
Won't be pullin' ah Bible mission for survival nigga so I creep the
Tech millimetre, somebody done pull the alarm now it's on,
Slaughterin' Bone, sprayed off the tech
Gotta let 'em know which way was on,
We got gone but them police was pullin' up quick nigga what's up
Quick bust in first when he hit that fence niggas got cut the fuck up,
We steady bucking, steady duckin' buckin' while I was jumpin'
All we was thinking is don't get caught
Nigga like me get the gun running
Gunning fronting with thugs gotta get to the smug
Turn around and we pump slugs, put 'em in the mud,
And all across my face was the red that lay in blood,
Dodging the who, make the gun flip with ah swoo,
Bailing back on with my troops,
I'm runnin' with 4 crazy niggas
That's down with they niggas they ain't scared to shoot,
Now I'm rolling, no more than ah half ah mile we get stopped
Cops surround Bone, we load glocks
And squeeze say fuck all these road blocks
Busted ah you, then put that bitch in reverse
And I get the swish and I push the button
That boy came out the trunk and,
Put it in drive see that Souljah boy bucking,
Back in the other direction,
Po-po came quick then heat up,
Niggas blast at each other,
Open up they doors and they get they feet up,
I jumped outta the car, had to jump over the hood,
Cause I'm headin' straight for the woods
So the niggas they follow behind me
We getaway smooth, ah nigga made good
Came up quick to the hideout
Wait until midnight till we ride out,
Hit ah car so we can drive out,
While we waited we all got fried out, fool
If you'se a thuggish ruggish thug nigga scream mo,
Took one ah my niggas off deathrow now we got one mo to go

I'm having fun, but all that I done
It hasn't always been right
They say I misuse, that I break the rules
But that won't get me uptight
Now they're telling me what I can never be
And always tryin' to bring me down
But I'm so strong, I'll prove them wrong
No matter what they say, I'm telling you right now

The broken body of a cat glows there

And now we're gonna make him drink it.
Come on Alex don't die or dry up!

And we finally meet, and she tries to draw him out a bit
She says ""He's writing something,

And he doesn't make a sound
He's just staring at his coffee

And this greatness she'll defend

Where you do your work, and you do your love
And they pay you, and praise your many talents

We're The Cross Movement, which is an alliance of 
Born again believers in Jesus Christ
That are trusting God by His grace to become
Agents through whom He's gonna advertise salvation
And also communicate His purpose for all of humanity

It's the thrilla' in Manilla
Jesus Christ versus every man's killa'
Sin and death's got the whole world getting' illa'
But I praise God for the Blood Spilla!


I step back to take a chill pill
Just to let the thrills build
Back up and now I have to say that I still feel
Goo-goo about the one the crew brings to you
Died to woo you and bring you back like part twoooh!
You know His name is the same, it's Jesus
Every knee will bow demon, man, woman, childoww!
Who is it that brings the blizzard, tames the lizard
Makes the greens and the gizzards?
If it's your God let him speak
I'll hide let him seek, I'll jump let him leap
Let him swim the deep. Did his blood leak?
Does your god love me?
Will he still propose even though I get ugly?
Can he turn trouble to ease
Can his love make me 'weak in the knees' like SWV?
If he can take the sins of the whole worldswallow 'em
Experience death then resurrect, then I'll follow him
But if he can't then I'm stayin' with my camp
We a pack of theocrats getting' amped 'cause our God is champ!
YAHWEH the highway to Heaven's doormat
Transliterated LORDall caps
Salvation for the creation He offers
No lie that's fly like a source of the slaughter and torture
Of the lamb frees and releases
Non-believers who put their faith in Jesus


As I take flight in Christ watch my height as I get lifted
Not off the herb, but the Wordmad gifted
It's the man of God that has his whole focus shifted
Toward the God who made the earth and all that comes with it
All of the specifics, the tidbits, the 'what is its,'
The 'aw, forget its,' the whole thingwho did this?
You say, 'Jesus, I don't get it?
I swear I see nothin' but the prosperity of the wicked.'
Let's kick it, so you could see the end that's predicted
When both sin and sinful men get evicted
I'm with it, but things look a messI'll admit this
And sin keeps bringing the stressI been witness!
But God the Son is gonna rise like a biscuit
Come back and fix it
I've got the scriptit's
It's scripted in scripture, but most will miss it
To them it's foolish, but I'ma school this district


Think hard, visualize the ill mob
Bombarding, fatally scarring the Son of God
Thugs sluggin,' the blood floodin'What in God's name made Him take the pain?
Much love in His heart for this world that He sparked with the verbal
The same men He made beat Him down 'til He was purple
And all could see His veins and arteries
All for you and all for me
The Savior died this is a call to be
A recipient of His life, 'cause if He didn't die
We all were gonna fry
And since we in this world dressed in this flesh that He formed
It's only right that we get our Christ on!
Yeah, I'm lovin' this chillin' under God-ruled government
Plus I'm in love with the new blood covenant
No blood no forgiveness, not a smidgen
Without the blood kid you only got religion
So marches to D.C. are no more than long trips
Prayer mail sent to Heaven with the wrong zip
Why else do you think He let divine blood drip?
Simple: we owe this sin debt and plus tip!
And there is gonna be a payday
The 'good times' will be behind some like the reruns of 'JJ'
The blood of the Lamb Jesus is mandatory

"Well I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
Twas a little place called Hamburger Dan's
And I heard that jukebox a playing song about a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee for it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox and play the truck drivin' man
The waitress just poured me some coffee
I thanked her and called her again
I said that old song sure does fit me
Cause I'm a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup
I climbed back aboard my old semi and then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a rolling yeah I'm on my way to San Antone
Pour me another cup
And play the truck drivin' man and play the truck drivin' man",Rock
"I can't stop
I just can't stop loving you
I can't stop my hands from holding you

No, I can't stop, no, no, no, no

I can't stop
I just can't stop holding you
And I can't quit a love like this from consuming you
There must be a reason why I feel so free

Your love is more than I deserve
Oh baby, you made me, you gave me your love...

"I can't complain I've made myself a name
And all I really want is five minutes of fame
Some material wealth and a life in good health
'cause all I really even care about is myself
I don't know a single thing about the situation
But why should I care about the next generation
I've got everything I need but I still want more
I can't understand why you complain 'cause you're poor
I don't feel sorry for you we've got he same possibilities
It's all about taking your own responsibility
I took mine so I deserve what I got
I've got my name on the wall of fame I'm going straight to the top
It cost me a lot of money but I took my degree
And that's the biggest difference between you and me
There's not a thing in the world that my money can't buy
I can't understand why you didn't even try
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
You can't blame me because you're underfed
You should be glad that you've got a roof over your head
If you worked for a living you could pay your rent
Instead of begging me for help when all your money's spent
You won't ever fool me because I know your type
I see you standing on the corner like a parasite
You're a loser and you know it but you don't even care
I can't understand why you say life ain't fair
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill
Pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay
Pay the bill
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't complain
I've done everything I can but it's still the same
I've got nothing to lose so why should I give a fuck
My life's a piece of shit and that's where I'm stuck
I never got a fair chance to even prove myself
So tell me why should I be nice to anybody else
You say you can't understand why I say life is a bitch
So what do you mean we've got the same possibilities
I haven't even got your educational abilities
I dropped out of school before I took my degree
'cause the welfare line made more sense to me
I try to work for a living so I can play all my debts
And I've come to realize this is as good as it gets
I hate my fucking life more than you hate me
I just can't understand why this is how it should be
So I complain it's still the same, we're standing still
While the next generation has to pay the bill
So I complain it's still the same, we're standing still
While the next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill
Pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill
Pay the bill
The next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay

"When you get up in the morning
While you work till late at night
As you sit alone and watch some movie
About guys who loves to fight
She will take off all her make-up
Brush her teeth and go to bed
Fall asleep and dream you laid your hand
Upon her head
Do you hear the calling
From a sidetrack of your mind
Singing backing vocals
To the sound of your busy line
You will sit in front of a paper
Sort your feelings if you can
But no matter what you think you are,
You are no long distance man
You will go out and stand there laughing
Pretend you're having fun
Getting used to people saying
Look what you've done
Do you hear the calling
From a sidetrack of your mind
Singing backing vocals
To the sound of your busy line
Twice as alone when you're together
Faking smiles and holding hands
Each one guided only by their own
Fears and demands
And together you'll walk in silence
Not knowing what to say
What was I thinking about the other day
When you get up in the morning
While you work till late at night
As you sit alone and watch...
You fall asleep in your Hollywood light",Pop

You started messing with my head until I hit a wall
Maybe I shoulda known, maybe I shoulda known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door

Cut to the punch, she broke your heart, and then she ran away

Now if we meet out on the street I wont be running scared
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air

Wrest your self from sleep
To face the morning light
So Pathologically
Trapped in a system that breaks originality
In favor of bland safe marketability
Middle of a long day
Turns into working long weeks
What are we doing this for
Whose fucking stocks will increase
At times we're all just little junkies and whores
Clawing scratching unattainable dreams

How much can we take
To labor and to break
Our backs against the system's walls
I say smash it fucking down
In control of our fate
We produce and we create
The guns from which we sell our souls
I say smash it fucking all

How ironic is the plan of our lives
Working doubles to survive, to get by
A passionless job in a meaningless lie
I despise being trite to get by
What do you offer?
What can you create?
What do you contribute?
What profit is made?

How much can we take
To labor and to break
Our backs against the system's walls

That when you wrap me around your fingers, baby

And you pick me up on Sauchiehall street

"Well I loved the Lone Ranger and I loved that Dennis Law
Him and George Best, sure knew how a kick a ball
I wanted tae be a cowboy, and learn a crack a whip
Stand up in that lonely street, two six guns on my hip
Along the mighty Beatles came, and everyone went ahhh
They could play and sing and everything, and of course that John could draw
Well that was it for me, I never once looked back
Tricks to learn, waves to catch, had a plan of attack
Are you lookin' at me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Are you lookin' at me, pal?
Then we headed south, where the surf came crashing in
From black and white to colour, from innocence to sin
It was summer in December, blowing heatwaves in my mind
People talking funny, some cruel and some were kind
From the crackle of the cane, to the frown of a big black snake
From the breakers at Bondi, down to Wallaga Lake
From the sound of a million fly screen doors, closing on the past
Like that chimney the fires couldn't burn, I was built to last
Are you lookin' at me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Are you lookin' at me, pal?
When I flew across the ocean, I was number one
People gave me everything, and I didn't need a gun
Walking down that avenue, I never felt so alive
People calling out my name, and i'd only just arrived
It was a tight rope walking bagpiper, in the middle of Central Park
Steam was rising from the ground, and I wore my cape out after dark
I had myself a moment, my day out in the sun
It's an unfinished story, but it's more than just begun
And I know more than one thing, but not more than two or three
An I'll tell you if you'll listen, and I'll tell you for free
It's no life being a cowboy, and eating all them beans
The coffee's cold, the herd is gone, and all you've got's your dreams
You can always put your spurs back on, but save them for Halloween
You're better off heading north, or somewhere you've never been

Making paper wads from napkins throwing toothpicks on the floor

The reason why my baby doesn't love me anymore

Not since I've been knowing her and that's a long long time
Drank so many cups of coffee bet you that I'll get an ulcer
Sittin' in this all nite cafe with my baby on my mind

Sittin' in an all nite cafe listening to the jukebox playing
Overhead the waitress saying I wonder why he don't go home
Guess my baby's out with someone laughing dancing and romancing

And yeah, it only takes two hours from here
Yeah, when we get there we'll write our brand new story
We're going to a place I know, where I was born
The city of flowers been waiting so long
Life too short you could've been shot
Remember this time, leave all your troubles behind
All your life you've waited for a time when that someone comes
To get your feet back on the ground
I'll be that someone to help just like in that Beatles song
So here we go we're going to a place
At the rainbows end to put some colors back on you
Let me be the gold and I will put the shine on you
And yeah we only have two exits to go
Yeah when we get there the pages will start turning
And all the lies you heard before keep coming back to you

There's been so many times
My heart has been broke in two
I kept on waiting in line
'cause nobody's heart was true
For every time I gave into love
I was always in the blue
And just when I was 'bout to give up
I found myself an angel called you
I've been waiting a lifetime for somebody
To love me like you do
Oh yeah 
I was thinking that I'd always be lonely
But God came up with someone like you
Just to think I had made up my mind
Love was over
Somebody gave me the love
That somebody was you
I tell you night after night
I prayed for someone like you
But no one ever was right
They could not compare to you
I wasn't sure if I could endure
If things just stay the same
I didn't know if God had in store
A day without your lovin' my way

"Whether they gag me, bound me, hollow point 'round me

Dump me off the side of a bridge and drown me

Spare my family, the details on how they found me

Vigil by candle light and gather 'round me

And talk about how I would lounge with fly women
How I was flossing in clubs in fine linen

Hopping in them, ill whips with chrome spinning
Malice was true to the game for 9 innings
We love sinning but now I answer for that
Apologize to my fam, I got you all dressing in black

A long line family and friends they signing in
My niece singing solo organs and violins

Wife in her black veil hands flooded with diamonds
Remaining calm under each arms my children
Daddy's in a better place entering golden doors

With ivory all white pillars and marble floors

Brand new physical frame with no flaws
On my throne thats guarded by angels with 4-4's

Terror retaliate, show 'em how real it be
A split second 'fore you blazed
They probably thought you was me

Returning on some Crow shit, let 'em know shit
They mess with the wrong click, quick to blow shit

Y'all know who owned this so they end my career
But still I put my tag on this earth Malice was here

Take a walk on my side
No more tears, no more fears, no more telling me lies
I only want cheers and heartfelt goodbyes
My death march is here, tell me who's gonna ride

Take a walk on my side
No more tears, no more fears, no more telling me lies
I only want cheers and heartfelt goodbyes
My death march is here, tell me who's gonna ride

Hold me high, Gucci suit and tie

Let my casket reach the sky, tell my girl don't cry

Just sing me a lullaby and let the white doves fly

'Cuz I heard from a bird, it's only sleep when you die

Break me in unison outside, right through the lens
My mother cried 'cuz she knew that I was only true to sin

Celebrate my passing with gun shots and systems blasting

Blown up posters of Terror held by children laughing

No matter how foul my burial open casket
Now, simply so they can see my clusters and my diamonds smiling 
I'm sorry, I failed, only 'cuz the ones I left were so real

For me my doggs will lie, die, shoot, cry or kill

First to Malice, sorry that I left you half in a hole
But now you'll write for both of us, ill channel thoughts
Through your soul

Emmanuelle, remember this when you see my nemesis
Drop my picture on his chest and make his family reminisce

Revenge so sweet and I crush you with the heat

You're the first one I call when it's time to put 'em to sleep

Now, fo real grand dragon horns stabbing the skys

Turn Mag' 'em, laser tag 'em, couldn't sever all ties

My final request on the day I'm layed to rest
Take my body to the ocean and have a water front ves'

This will be my burial this eulogy will be in stereo
Blue Angels will draw my face during an aerial

Take a walk on my side
No more tears, no more fears, no more telling me lies
I only want cheers and heartfelt goodbyes
My death march is here, tell me who's gonna ride

Take a walk on my side
No more tears, no more fears, no more telling me lies
I only want cheers and heartfelt goodbyes
My death march is here, tell me who's gonna ride

Take a walk on my side

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you 
I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way
I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about
Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way
Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you",Pop
"Sittin' home on a Saturday night
I can't believe she called me
I've beening waitin' for my whole life
and now she's dead
Betty Sue..is dead!
Betty Sue...
I've got nothin' better to do
Sittin' home on a Saturday night
then to sit here and play with myself
Betty Sue...is dead!
now that she's dead
Betty Sue...
This song is about my girlfriend from 1953.
her except for me.
She was the hottest girl in town. But nobody liked
there's no such thing as a bi-sexual in 1953!
She was bi-sexual...bi-sexual  bi-sexual 
there's no such thing as a bi-sexual in 1953!

She died yesterday  in a car wreck 
She died yesterday  in a car wreck 
looking at her playboy..and now she's dead!
a large price to pay to be a pervert
Betty Sue...
Betty Sue...is dead!
...to be a pervert!
Betty Sue is dead.
Betty Sue...is dead!
oh yeah she's one dead girl!",R&B

Cold wind's blowing, confusions growing,
Signs showing nobody's home,
Peer through your window, Nothing but an empty soul,
Where'd you move, Where'd you go
Am I too late, to stop this,
I'm in disbelief, I keep knocking,
But the carving in that old oak tree, said forever you and me,
The one thing I believed in has failed me

When everyone was looking on the outside in
I got to know you behind closed curtains,
And be the one that made sure that you're safe and warm

How could you leave me, all alone, in the cold, at the door,
Without a key to your heart,
How could you leave me, no goodbye, boy I'm gone, movin on and now my love won't survive,
Where can I mail off and send this, pent up emotion, cause you don't live here anymore,
How could you leave me, all alone in the cold at the door,
Without a key to your,

Heart's pounding, yelling loudly, throwing rocks at your windows,
Trying to kick it, put my, shoulder into it and once more tried the handle,
And the telephone's disconnected, no electricity, I'm assuming,
With our prints in the cement, remember when we were six,
Wish we could be there again

When everyone was looking on the outside in
I got to know you behind closed curtains,
And be the one that made sure that you're safe and warm

How could you leave me, all alone, in the cold, at the door,
Without a key to your heart,
How could you leave me, no goodbye, boy I'm gone, movin on and now my love won't survive,
Where can I mail off and send this, pent up emotion, cause you don't live here anymore,
How could you leave me, all alone in the cold at the door,
Without a key to your heart
You said you'd never leave, this home feels so empty,
Tell me where did you go, go,
Never saw a moving sign, just locked out wondering why,
Your heart don't live here no more, How could you

How could you leave me, all alone, in the cold, at the door,
Without a key to your heart,
How could you leave me, no goodbye, boy I'm gone, movin on and now my love won't survive,
Where can I mail off and send this, pent up emotion, cause you don't live here anymore,
How could you leave me, all alone in the cold at the door,
Without a key to your heart",Pop
